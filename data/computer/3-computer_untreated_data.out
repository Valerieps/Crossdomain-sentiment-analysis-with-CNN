Incredribly uneven First off I cannot believe how mad this game has made me I like all kinds of games but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped It s one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do what to do etc even after I killed all the bad guys I didn t know how to get out of the room This game is not intuitive sp at all Secondly this game should not be called the Incredibles it should be called Mr Incredible because you play as him almost all the time Playing as Elasta Girl is great I really enjoyed that part but when there are a lot of baddies with guns Mr Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload I liked the first mission as Dash when you play as Dash which is only twice you have to run fast however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn t see what was ahead of me Playing a Violet was bad they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission The Incredi ball mission Incredibi sucked it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place I m just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven t enjoyed a lot of it which is a shame because I really loved the movie Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr Incredible needs to do more than punch people Currently I m on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more Bottom line Playing as Elasta girl was fun everything else was either blah or made me want to swear a lot Hopefully the second game will be better I ll be renting that instead of buying this game left me disappointed overall 
No one will be super Shouldn t you people know by now Say it with me NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible It was way too easy to die in etc etc etc Hey listen Keep you money Your investment isn t in here 
Cheap wiring I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend s daughter for her birthday She loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead It started with the static for a while but then while I was singing it just died completely I know I m not a great singer but I m not THAT bad 
Died after two times I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing it completely died What a complete disappointment Save your money 
You get what you pay for This game was originally released for 10 dollars Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2 
Ummm no This game is simply put not good I got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk It is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all In fact these characteristics are probably why it s so mainstream even though it s laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way don t even belong on consoles Owning at this game means you are an average player Any true FPS gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it s worth anything at all It isn t 
EHHH I used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it s just not good 
PS 2 slim slimmer why the vertical stand is wonderfull but why you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape I put my PS slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product I bought it just for kicks literally 
Great idea horrible product If you re looking to spend money on this don t Having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a Commodore 64 and being the current fan that I am I was really excited when I heard about this product Unfortunately it stinks There are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems the rest being mediocre at best The overall bad choice of games isn t my issue with this thing though It s the CRUMMY JOYSTICK Control is horrible The stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore As someone else pointed out in their review often it doesn t even respond when pushed in a certain direction I can t believe it s 2006 yet these companies releasing plug n play video game contraptions can t even make a decent joystick A real letdown 
could be better Not as much fun as I remember Maybe better if they had a better selection of games One on One Hardball etc 
A bargain in disappointment I purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting However what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product 
It s seems great until you realize the joystick doesnt work I was really excited when I saw this item was out I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick doesn t work at ALL when you move it to the right So you can only use it to go up down or left BIG Dissapointment Don t waste your 
Extremely disappointing This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part regardless of what anyone says I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non intuitive battle system Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy including the very first one Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets The game has very few items weapons or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies which are stronger than expected The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy Battles with main enemies are long which isn t such a problem However they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle just to frustratingly finish off a battle weakened party Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying I don t remember any music from this game so plain it is Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga Very noticeable is the use of swearing which is the main reason I don t enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore New meaningless characters have been introduced into the story and the focus shifted far away from the main characters The cover character hardly says or does anything this time There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment but if you blink you will miss it This game is far more frustrating than challenging which is not a good game trait I don t recommend even playing this game before reading the above to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits If you re looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great you will be extremely disappointed The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided 
Not as expected I loved the first Xenosaga Then this arrived Episode 2 isen t a bad game in terms of the story the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE Then you get into a battle Now if you like tactical stuff this is a good game for you But if you re trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing I say save your money Gone is the amazingly well done battle system in the first episode In its place stands a completely out of nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps Ridiculous but that s not all The enemies have weak zones that depend of the height of the attack that you input The zones are A B and C A being the highest Triangle=C square=B and Circle=A SOMETIMES See what I mean It s completely screwed up and you have to become deeply addicted to the game to understand its full potential And if that wasn t enough they changed the voice actors too Kos Mos s voice sounds more like an operator than a robot s and Momo sounds like a brat At least chaos voice has improved I d prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel otherwise spend your moey on something else like Shadow Hearts for example 
The series killer Pros Mechs are a bigger part of the games you actually have to use them The graphics of the cutscreens are great and the graphics overall are better than before A couple of the characters look better Much harder than Episode I More optional bosses Cons New battle system is a load of mouse spunk can I say spunk Most characters look worse especially Kos Mos and Jin travels throughout space with no pants on Almost all of the sidequests are terrible Very short The story is much weaker The dictionary is gone and so are Shion s glasses No shops Why are there no shops Too much more to list Just bad The movie Howard the Duck is better than this 
Great Black Screen to Go with Every Question We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex We thought Oh this will be fun since the show is cool So we got home and played it and it was so annoying There s just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background Just don t buy it if you want to have any fun 
A very depressing effort that could ve been so much more When Disney Interactive released quot Who Wants to Be a Millionaire quot in early 2000 they anticipated a very warm response to the disc which had a firm but low opening price However when actually being played the game is sure to depress If it isn t crudely simple the design is poor and uninspired The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again quot Be Sure to come back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire quot quot I hope you ll join me again on Who Wants to be a Millionaire quot If one doesn t decide to resell or simply trash this game within its first week of purchase they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves Don t waste your time on this pitiful effort 
Downgraded physics as in GT 3 Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult made worse by poor car physics Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars while light cars easily derail your heavy car Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal and that s with sports tires Long gone are the ESPN like replays of GT 2 For some reason cars look thinner than before The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen The 3D mechanics can be headache prone made worse by the poor physics of the cars Easily the most inadequate music ever The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes which is nothing new However it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track The game has mostly only newer models almost none from a few years ago unlike in GT 2 The only good thing about this game is that you don t have to drive all the time The B Spec driving mode can win races for you Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen This can help in skipping the painful early parts of the game The powertrain is still not modifiable Compression bore stroke camshaft timing overlap valve size and other engine characteristics are still not available With poor driving physics engine modification would not have helped this game Loading times are very long with the most annoying loading indicator ever Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens This game is a yet another disappointment much like GT 3 was The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like you will have to drive them for real The Gran Tourismo series are over unlikely to return to what they used to be I m not a racing game fan but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy If you want good car make independent physics you need to play Gran Tourismo 2 
Now I need a new XBOX DOn t buy this it will crash your entire xbox Learn to play forget the cheats 
Not what I expected If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had this is not for you Not only do you HAVE to have a computer If anything happens to the disk you are screwed You won t be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion So if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there 
cheaper toys r us returned item for refund found it cheaper at Toys R U 
STINKS SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE AND SOFTWARE IS VEERY CONFUSING HORRIBLE BUY I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK 
A repetitive flop I am extreamly dissapointd with this game Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location There is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings 
So this is supposed to be realistic Really Wow So players in real football go through other players torso s They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs WR s change direction on one foot pivot glide and elude tackles Uh ok Anyone who plays this game on the All madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game What are the nerds at EA thinking Do they ENJOY making a game who s AI constantly cheats I love how they tout games that give the user more control when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game I don t control if I catch it or drop it or intercept it or if my line blocks of if my DB s cover their assignment none of it The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all drop easy picks drop easy catches etc And why oh why are DT s and LB s faster than my fastest WR Is THAT realistic The AI is terrible It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats Terrible game Just stop making these games if this is your final product 
Do Not Waste Your Money On Madden 2007 Read My Review This game is a joke It is the same exact game as the 2005 version with minimal additions The online play is so glitchy and drops so often its not even worth the time Do not go out and buy this game thinking that its better because of all the hype If you want to play a great football game go get NFL 2K5 by 2KSports Sega Sports This game is 3 years old and blows Madden away any day of the week In 2k5 you are able to go to roster manager and change your rosters to make them current You can edit players and create rookies like Reggie Bush or Jerious Norwood and make the roster the same as the current 2007 NFL lineups Madden bought the rights to be the only official Nfl game for the sole reason that Madden sucks and he wants to make all the money and not spend any money improving his game Madden bought the rights to the Nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make an official Nfl game and thats why there is no 2k7 or any other game football game for it to compete with Thats why Blitz is the only other game and they cannot use Nfl players so they have to have a generic game without real players I hate Madden with a passion 2K Sports is the way to go for any sports game including football you just have to do some manual labor updating rosters but once you have it is current and still 10x better than Madden will ever be DO NOT BUY THIS GAME 
I HATE THIS GAME I swear if it wasn t that i liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much i d just break this game at then i d move on and be happy But i can t do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that i did nt want to waste money This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game Oh my god this is so childish You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn t feel like doing that in this one You are a monkey man How stupid is that Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one im just happy i beat in and can put that awful exp behind me AHHHHHHHHHH 
They destroyed the mini games I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it I own ALL of them and so when I stood in line all night Saturday and through Sunday morning 8am I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii I bought an entire set of controllers anticipating the mini game fun with all my friends We re huge SMB fans all of us It always makes an appearance at our parties But now I m really angry They completely gutted our favorite mini game s hitting Monkey Target worst of all I can honestly say I don t care that there are 50 freakin mini games because now Monkey Target is completely worthless Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items increasingly difficult levels magnets velcro double bonuses wind speed and direction and the all import ramp run off you have a cannon one level no wind or wind direction no bonuses and no special items Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level Monkey squash no joy there A lot of the controls for the mini games are terrible And so on so forth The new mini games suck almost unilaterally but gosh darn there are 50 of them But volume does not make up for lack of quality I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB Banana Blitz are nice The graphics are beautiful and fun But the best part of the game for me and my friends is now gone and dead None of the reviews I d read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this and if they had I certainly wouldn t have wasted my 50 plus tax If Sega people are reading this BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET That s what people play at parties when they re slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party 
Unfortunate Gaming As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for They gave us Advent Children cell phone games and finally Dirge of Cerberus This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man 
Yes All of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs ing you Those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans that game was barely mediocre at best Other ff7 releases = advent children cell phone game and movie tv show thing All three things resectively sucked Now comes Dierge of Cerberus whoop did eeee doo The only reason why I rented it was because the title says final fantasy in it The only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes other than that boring If you can get more than 20 minutes through the game then by all means it s the game for you 
I want my money back I really wanted to like this game unfortunately for me it blows I d trade it for a migraine if I could The gameplay is pretty horrible the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992 where you press the Attack key and swing your sword aimlessly at the bad guy The run gun part of the game is nothing to write home about either It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked out 1 legged drunken monkey Also I know the graphics aren t the Wii s strong point but that is no excuse to regress back to 8 bit When you re trying to shoot someone across the room it really sucks when you can t tell them apart from a flower pot or is that a lawn chair The cut scene s were obviously supposed to look like Sin City I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding They look like an amateur flash slide show Kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah This game is a joke Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed 
Worse game mechanics I can t stand this game after 5 minutes The game is so unresponsive its not funny The first board I wanted to throw my remote My friend watching asked me what the hell was going on I seriosly didn t move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around At first I thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then I was playing trauma center before and after Red steel and not once did i have a problem with the controls Seriously the worst game i ever played 
False Advertisement This is a perfect example of false advertisement If you re like the many that i ve heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2 Don t order this one unless you have a newer model The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn t come with one So save yourself the hassle and don t order this 
WHY buy this I saw a DVD player at Target for 30 yesterday I especially don t see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it s 40 Space saving maybe 
Simplicity A simple DVD player as long as you or a friend own an X box console Simply push in a little plastic knob into the controler socket and their you go oyu know own a standard of the line DVD player The maginfacation is great the rewind and fastfrward is great It has all the extras a normal DVD player has and a easy to operate menu and layout No overloads of pointless buttons just point out the obvious structer You may be dissapointed in the response time but that is not entirely the remote or players fault If you own an old x box console or a low memory X box console you may encounter slowness and maxed out freezing Some mint condition titles may not even work I purchased Little Nicky sometime ago mint and to this date it still does not work on my X box console Batteries may play a roll With out a doubt though this is the most easy and portable DVD player around with the acknowledgement of owning an X box console first A must have for a gamer movie lover wit ha large movie library or a constant renter 
Get only if you don t have a stand alone DVD player already Hey kids fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90 s and don t already have a DVD player Like my title suggests if you already have a DVD player this is a waste of money The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD R s that I got from a friend I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD R s in question with no problem However aside from those two DVD R s all of the DVD s I own are bought from retail stores so I really have no need to play DVD R s and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly With that being said I only used XBOX s DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD R s I had problems with Because of the content of these burned movies there is really no need to watch them again However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC s or Mac to watch the burned DVD no need to use my XBOX for that I meant to return the DVD kit the next day but never got around to it The XBOX s DVD player is a good feature but the fact that Microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money unless of course you don t have a DVD player at all 
Broke after 20 minutes My only experience with this product was after I opened it and started to play a DVD in my Xbox when I tried to pause it it didn t work and it had brand new batteries I found after much frustration that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so I just got my money back You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs 
ATTENTION DO NOT USE THIS the dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox 
not for pc this just sucks the main person just keeps running around He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he won t peddle but gos backwards quite well Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked Atleast I bought it used and for not much money Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later 
Disappointing although some appeal can be found I m going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC only gamer I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion activated actions within the game rowing throwing grenades close combat etc As a result after spending the night out in the cold to get my console and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise I grabbed three games Zelda a no brainer Trauma Center and Call of Duty 3 Of those three titles I m sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth As I have stated before I am a PC gamer I m really into my hobby and love the satisfaction of building a PC which can manage all the latest games I played CoD 1 and 2 on the PC and greatly enjoyed both By far the biggest problem with the Wii version however especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer are the graphical shortcomings of the title I literally had no idea what was going on I could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why I was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels Added to this I had no idea how to get rid of the first German to engage me in hand to hand combat a much advertised feature which is actually just an interactive cut scene I followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly and although I worked myself into a frenzy causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me that inevitable German I tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in kept clubbing me to death Even beyond this setback I found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented It is also disappointing yet speaks volumes that the grenade throwing function that involves you actually throwing the nunchuck without letting go by the way unless you ve got a backup TV is disabled by default trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target get cut down blow yourself up For the record I know that the Wii controller works I ve played many hours of other games already as the system conveniently informs you This just seems like a shoddy implementation of it I can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes Nevertheless it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which even to my gameplay over graphics mentality in buying the Wii blocks the enjoyability of this title To be honest it has made me think that WW2 isn t the best suited area for the Wii After all these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements My advice on the FPS front wait for the Wii Far Cry game and see how that turns out In the meantime there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the Wii graphics waiting for your attention Before leaving you I d just like to clarify on thing this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles Perhaps you re reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the Wii straight from a gamecube instead of PC high definition gaming Oh and if you re still determined to buy it keep an eye out for my used copy of the game I m going to need the money for Banana Blitz 
DEFECT Doesn t work on Slim PS2 I haven t even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my PS2 After the PS2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens I thought it was maybe just that disc but I exchanged it and the same thing happened I called Ubisoft and they said many people with the Slim PS2 have called to say it doesn t work but they don t have any answers Sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many PS2 s Do not buy if you don t want the risk of it not working 
I was looking forward to this As one that couldn t stand NBA Ballers I thought I would give this game a try Pros create a baller Nice graphics Cons Defense If you are a fan of Pheonix Sun basketball you will love this game The announcer needs to learn ENGLISH The whole I Ball Trick Stick is horrible and will have you sreaming as you re stuck on the second side game that is required before you can advance on And 1 tour That stupid mic trick that allows you to score 4 points with one shot Stupid Watch This Trick that you can t stop despite the fact that you can still move your player You can t even block You can not choose who you want to face in other game modes unless you are playing two player Guess which game I ll be trading for NBA Live 2007 or WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007 this fall 
Lacking on most games and especailly this Bull s t game Ok let me break itdown for you The Game isn t all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year Really you really can t blame them that made this game The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out I Promise you that year want disoponte So dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 Dont waiste your mone 
low memory and overpriced why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can These memory cards are way over priced I love PS2 It s one of the best systems I have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam I already own 2 cards and I need more 
What a waste of good graphics This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from As it is right now it s just a really really really crappy version of Zelda Orcarina of Time If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
This game is not for PC users I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less This game when played on the X Box was great So when it came out for PC I bought it BIG MISTAKE The control are too hard to learn And when you are in a battle you can t stop to think which keys when used together work There are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing I wasted my money on this game I deleted it and will never play it Don t waste your money 
Logitech Cordless Headset for Xbox I ordered this from amazon it shipped from 3btech and ive had no luck with it the communicator its self is quite comfortable but i cannot comment on the quality of the mic or the audio that comes through it because it will not charge i called logitech tech support and the tech asked me the usual questions is it plugged in have you tried a different wall outlet have you tried jiggling the plug at the communicator end and so on after all the questions the tech said that it was defective and that they were running dangerously low on stock of that particular one So i guess what im trying to say is order at ur own risk and i hope you have better luck with it than i did 
dont buy this just wait for 360 ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one i no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also and to this day he constantly has to say hold up im switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360 
Just another FPS all prettied up and overblown Have you played any of the games in the Doom series How about Metroid Prime Medal of Honor Golden Eye Well then you ve played Halo 2 also because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same I don t care how many times X Box magazine odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X BOX game is the system s magazine calls it the greatest game of all time I d rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme utterly mundane unoriginal boring and just all around unentertaining The gameplay is so generic that it s as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer the music is cliche the voice acting is flat and Master Chief is just an all around retard The weapons oh boy the weapons again another lame aspect of the game The alien s weapons are like something in the kid s toy gun section from Toys R Us and the human guns are nothing that I haven t used in a Resident Evil game When the first Halo came out I didn t get the big deal I didn t even play it then eventually I got myself an X Box and decided to give this installment a shot huge mistake Come to think of it none of the games of X box are even worth owning a system for Fable was decent but got old after beating it a few times The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring and everything else on X Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube 
Great physics details potential but wasted Halo 1 on steroids Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie s creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense and has no flow along with levels that aren t replayable You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious Try the headache inducing map design in this game Also in the nonsense the unneccesary switch to an Elite s perspective for half the game along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon Apes with mohawks yeah nice design I can only play one or two levels of the single player and they are so noobish it loses appeal quickly On to Multiplayer Okay in 2004 upon release this was a great game It took time to go up in level and the ranking system wasn t as abused as it is now Once new maps kept on the harddrive read mod kids were released by Bungie that opened the door to full blown chaos Now 2 years later modding has died down somewhat but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25 likely you ll find a game with no lag So I still play on occasion it s lame they can t offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice choose servers with good connections and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too I only pray Halo 3 s multiplayer improves on this system otherwise I m done with the Xbox console permanently 
The story is great as for the game Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII I ordered this game I loved that game and thought Say if Final Fantasy VII is this good then VIII must be even better boy was I wrong I m not bashing Final Fantasy VIII I kind of liked the game but there are big problems with it First of all the draw system is kind of hard but I liked it it was a change of pace but the way you have to equip summon GFs Guardian Force was hard and boring The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie AKIRA which is a bad thing The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops Not only that but the characters are not very likeable Main characters Squall A member of SeeD he is a jerk to everybody Zell A member of SeeD he is a surfer dude and a dunce Quistis A teacher and a member of SeeD she seems to like Squall for one reason or another Seifer Squall s rival he is even worse then Squall Rinoa A member of The owls Square soft ran out of ideas she is just like Aeris Selphie A member of SeeD she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts Laguna A Galbadian soldier He is the best charecter in the game Irvine A member of SeeD he is a lady s man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made The story is great but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP I would buy it but only if they removed the draw system 
Misguided Copy Protection This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I ve ever experienced I bought this game new at a local store because I ve been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card Got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed Tried it with the other disc failed again Went to the company s support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund 
Starforce = Hardware damage Don t buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need ed for my DVD burner Check the search engines and see for yourself Would have otherwise been a great game too bad it isn t playable because of this malware 
Starforce=Coaster Starforce nothing else need be said Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games I don t know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS Gaming Laptop 
Install Problems I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice It would not run I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again it would not run When I went to the knowledge base technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card the game will not work on your system In short if you have an over the counter system you cannot run this game on your computer I find this ridiculous and disappointing I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box 
Don t Bother With It This game sucks It tries to be Sim City with extra features Unfortunately the graphics are way below average In fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short 
StarForce This game has StarForce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer Reportedly it replaces your CD and or DVD drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems I ve been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it It could be the best game that s ever been produced but anyone who s had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear 
Sony Playstation 2 Remote I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD s on the PS2 easier I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work I hoped it would get better but it only got worse I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away I would NEVER recommend this product 
Do not buy Pelican screen protectors or styluses for the NDS I know that Pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they re always the cheapest ones available That should tell you something First of all the top screen uses adhesive It s smooth plastic in the middle but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen Because the edge is a different material than the middle it s insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it and being adhesive trying again and again isn t much of an option Furthermore the sticky edge is white not clear and it looks horrible on my onyx DS Lite After having so much difficulty with the top screen protector I checked online for reviews I read several reports of people who used the Pelican styluses with the Pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour s worth of use So whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus the combination just doesn t work Many people report simply throwing their Pelican Write and Protect sets into the trash so I m not the only one that paid Pelican money for something that s going into the trash can No matter how inexpensive Pelican s product is it s still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too I know I m going to avoid the Pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future and I very much wish that there were reviews here on Amazon before I bought mine I had to dig through Nintendo DS forums to read other peoples opinions Finally if you already bought one and hate it you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue 
Hate It This is Supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc A shoddy product 
er not good People I don t know what you see in this game It s not really a bad game it s just an average arcade shooter More often than not I can t even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly I pop out from behind something and I m dead meat Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game 
Don t buy if you have an LCD Rear Projection or Plasma TVs I d like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn t work on LCD televisions It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets 
Very dull This game has a good concept nice graphics and some definitely funny moments but the gameplay is a total bore There are two main gameplay styles investigation and trial Investigation is the worst it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room talking to everyone and a ton of pointless reading much like an old point and click adventure on PC The court sections are a little better but not much Once again it s very linear you don t have to use your brain much just try all the options And once again there is a huge amount of reading There is way too much dialogue packed into the game and not near enough actual gameplay And most of the talking is aimless too very little of it actually advances the plot Overall this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text 
Never Received Thanks Amazon My nephew really needed a new controller So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday The game was received fine but he never received the controller I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon So the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation Who knows the controller could have been wonderful 
Buyer s Dual Shock The Playstation controller is nice However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy maybe even more so The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit This controller feels great with the thumb pads thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement Suddenly in 2005 four years after the PS2 was released games like Metal Gear Solid III Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini games feature The controller has been given new life because of this The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality This controller for all its design will give you a dual shock First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1 L2 or R1 R2 wing buttons Even if you don t drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink I have never seen one that managed to remain straight Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don t need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time Make these controllers more robust please The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly 
Rented it 1 star for looking at the game cover in the store 2 stars for the visual and audio and playinggggg Walk pick up specified items push things use a few gadgets Those save points that are maddening rather than save as you go Things to do over for the another character Same collection of villans over and over The cut scenes are sketched for you and the narration is on and on why do the houses look so similar Stuff in the houses that you can not touch boring Find Things you need but can not use yet and have to go back for it Not so puzzle solve as much as fetch this and that No free range chicken doors are often locked Had to catch same snakes more than 3 times weeee Atleast if you fail a task you get to try again REMEMBER nothing goes well from the get go I found no cheats online for this game as of yet Dont play the piano you hit buttons when they float by on screen The kids are cute and each special gadget and moves such as they are I have Never read these books but there is a Warning at the start of the game that this is depressing and states nothing comes out right for these kids If you want to try this game rent it If you want to buy this game for someone make sure you dont mind making yourself depressed for spending the cash and them for playing it Do you play the game or does it play you 
Ehh I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun Well it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it I d only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily 
My Review I bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage 
Over rated When I first played this game I got bored in 10 minutes All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them Bring girls into your car and do it with them I dont recommend this game at all its overrated 
To bad the XBox lasted only two months When I bought the XBox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don t feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months I can t say the person that sold me the XBox has even tried to email me since I ve emailed him hmmmm 
what a stupid attempt to a stupid game This game is horrible I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it I had wasted 5 bucks Its patheticic You cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay Pros Sunny can bite yay Cons Horrbiel graphics only 3 playable characters Bad humor Short cutscenes u cant do anything 1 path game hardly 3d seriously it doesnt look like it 
does not work with S controller This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller Unless you still use the old monster sized XBox controller these cables are worthless 
It is a tedious game that made me sick Tediously long and weary Nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW HL2 etc I am sick of this 
Horrible game Beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful Not to mention the monsters level up with you so you ll never be at an advantage You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 
Good for exploring very poor story I bought the game couple of weeks ago I was hesitating on buying it initially but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game I wish I didn t buy it To be fair I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape cities and the level of details in the game I don t think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game For me landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story if there is any story from my perspective I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate I don t see any excitment in playing the game any further I explored most of the cities though quite quickly The conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with It was nice the first couple of times but then I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion Just to tell you about the action excitment I am talking about I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play 
Lobs gallore 80YD TD passes everytime BORING I can t believe how many people are saying how realistic this game is That can not be further from the truth All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80 of the time regardless of coverage What fun is that This in itself is highly unrealistic Don t even get me started on the other things this game does NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game realism is thrown out the window in this one EA does not know the meaning of AI The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does Don t waste your money and don t make EA any more richer its obvious they just throw these games together They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank 
great game if you like BS plays and inconsistency I really tried to like this game being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition The graphics and sound are great in this game but its ruined by EA s cheating AI I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life No matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling even if you think you have them beat on a play your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass If you throw a high pass not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you even if you press the passing button your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack This game is total BS there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation When you are playing defense you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes Not the CPU receivers the CPU receivers regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time if they don t catch it the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion Think again you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation Not the CPU the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he s being hit What about the inconsistency you ask Well let me explain How is it that one game you can be totally on but the next game you can t even complete ONE pass I ll tell you why The CPU wants you to lose so you will drop every pass fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book I was playing a game and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD before my offense even touched the field Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU BS lobs BS runs and BS calls I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half Its not because the CPU was playing good defense its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them wide open or not I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game 1 for 20 I think At this point I knew I had no chance of winning so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win Yes you can win games as I have but it is so inconsistent If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose nothing you can do about it I see why EA bought the license after putting out crap like this they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI instead of this cheating crap I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good EA sucks and so does this game 
Fuhgettaboutit If you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do But it won t operate a DVR DVD VCR or cable box If you re really keen on it I ll sell you mine 
Junk No way to change the inputs on your TV The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a tv button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on off the TV or the XBox And if things couldn t get any dumber if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn t work The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode There is also no option to program a receiver As many others mentioned this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage 
Do not buy this please read Try before you buy This game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again Beware 
I Think It s Time We Move On People First let me say that I whole hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius Back in the glory days of Counter Strike 2001 2002 this game was the be all end all for 1 Online video games 2 First Person Shooters 3 PC Games and 4 Any video game basically It had real life weapons the graphics were superb at the time the maps were extremely well made the system requirements are still obscenely low and damnit it was fun Then inevitabely the hands of time began to take their ruthless indiscriminate toll Video cards supported better graphics new and yes better games came out Battlefield 1942 Unreal Tournament 2004 hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter Strike and a lot of the cool casual gamers grew up or moved on From 2000 to 2004 Counter Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance By 2004 to present day it has become a problem Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom s worn out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98 Counter Strike is still one of the most popular games of all time with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day because people just don t seem to have enough self control to give up their hopeless addiction Today server admins are for the most part humorless dictators and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game s undeniable monotonous drone People are still playing the same maps from the 1 0 release that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential It always feels as if I ve played the same round a thousand times before and I probably have Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way and all look disguisting I ve played on probably over 500 servers and downloaded probably over the same amount of quality custom maps and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation or voted on by the players Furthermore people are still playing the game using dial up and CS veterans are always complaining about camping even if its a tactic used to complete the objective As far as the objectives are concerned Counter Strike has basically become a deathmatch game No one will listen to anyone s plan on the rare occasion there is one no one tries to rescue the hostages and everyone always calls someone a p y or nub if you use the auto shotgun or AWP And to top it all off Valve cancelled the outstanding won net and replaced it with this Steam garbage a utility soaking wet with incompetence L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter Strike culture and has become its own incessant frustration But I won t even get into that If you re new to CS don t bother veterans of this game are far from friendly and you ll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you re a beginner For now if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game check out World of Warcraft Battlefield 1942 Sven Co Op or even Team Fortress Classic a dated game with an awesome community that has yet to lose its initial charm 
Extreamly Overrated and Overhyped I ll make this short and sweet for you I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this gem and see what all the fuss is about on this game OVERRATED I have no idea how people prais this as THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD How silly This game is just plain average If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve I don t need to tell you but I ll give you a hint H f L fe This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring And I don t need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours The good Visuals are good I guess Bad Very Mediocer Plain boring combat Nothing new Online isn t that great Extreamly Overrated TRUST ME Gets boring after awhile And yes I played this out for more then an 1hour 2 bucks I ll never get back 2 1 out of 5 stars Extreamly Overrated Not worth my 2 bucks and that s all I got to say Peac 
NOT for MechWarrior fans If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series this ISN T it This is an extemely dumbed down version of MW Even if you Mechwarrior fans forget about having no customization remember this You can only fire one weapon at at time You have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets I was bored after about 5 minutes Again people who never played MW series may like this game better 
A sloppy emotionless title with few redeeming factors As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story The idea is that a secret off world clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map It seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightly colored shapes If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters I could go on because the game certainly doesn t stop there but I think you get the point I like to think that there s a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super detailed realism Generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because they re almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location Cartoons on the other hand generally don t worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time How much fun would the Wile E Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that s overly detail centric in an environment that s right out of a kid s show The result is a tale that comes off as way WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer s imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic There s a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and it s up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world That s it no side stories no reasoning no subplots just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B And here I thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an ages old cliche Now I don t want it to sound like I m railing on this game just because it s got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor It s also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself You don t hate the pig on the spaceship because he s trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because she s never mentioned between the game s start and its finish I mean the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight I don t honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging The first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools Shortly thereafter you re thrown to the wolves For the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether it s retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk har har above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point You ll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick I just can t overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is If there s a bottomless pit nearby and chances are very good that there is Blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what you re hitting on the control pad If there s an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button he ll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threat That s not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings The ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc All the while Blinx is moving around in real time It s a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized Why can t I use two controls at the same time Why don t more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers Why doesn t the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when I use my time powers Why is their duration so brief and why can t I hold more than a dozen uses at a time I mean this could ve really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run of the mill platformer The controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls He has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks He routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether you ve instructed him to do so or not He ll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasm I think it s these controls that most make Blinx so mind squashingly aggravating At a glance you d imagine they d be fairly difficult to screw up You ve got a jump button a suction fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement Plus there had already been a long established line of three dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title s release paving the way to an ideal control experience Super Mario 64 had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre s jump to the world of 3D It s like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway I can t even say I m impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper either With the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than you d imagine especially in contrast with Blinx himself Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury Here s a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and he s pitted against a set of monsters that could ve sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four year old s sketchbook Despite featuring a spoken dialog track there s no English voice acting I couldn t pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think it s either French or some close variation of it It certainly didn t sound Japanese While this does add a touch of personality to the title and it s not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television Everyone s vocal personalities are so black and white too that I feel like a great chance to establish some much needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here The bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and high pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball It s like a parody of the games that had come before but I won t give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose Overall Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a far below average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public At the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality On top of that I really don t know which audience they were targeting with it The game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kid friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can t imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx reaching near Marvel vs Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight The game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super tough later levels though you ll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process and enjoy self mutilation I d recommend you stay far away 
the worst game ever I hate this game its the worst game I ve ever played 
disappointing I was so excited to see this game come out I loved the Godfather and From Russia with Love and the hype surrounding this game was incredible The actual game however was incredibly disappointing The driving controls especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather are AWFUL I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to Most of the missions involve driving under a specific time limit and with these awful controls I gave up early way too frustrating The musical play list that you get to control was fun but I would have liked more free roaming like in the Godfather I was also looking forward to hearing everyone s voices that were in the opening credits Dale Earnhardt Jr But since I have almost totally given up on it now I guess I won t get to hear their voice acting talent Does anyone know if they plan to re release this on the xbox 360 Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to 
Why Tony Why Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie From Russia With Love which is actually not a bad game Recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this I simply couldn t resist picking up SCARFACE THE WORLD IS YOURS I loved the movie SCAR FACE and I was gonna love this But It turns out I didn t The controls are really a joke instead of your normal FPS 3PS RPG etcetera there are really bland controls you can t even tell what to do The dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke For die hard fans only I guess 
Overpriced and Not Very Worth It You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims the Stuff Pack is not very worth it Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny 
Where are the items I noticed there were not many new items in this game I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving This expansion ws not worth the money 
It s nice but Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss I have had many collections I ve downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable So I was looking forward to a Stuff pack from Maxis Bah Yes there are several very nice items but really this is an underwhelming collection on the whole Items are very limited and the collections are small The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained Like so many here remarked the money spent is not equal to the value received Another reviewer pointed out what the title Glamour Life implies jewelry house items luxurious textures for floors and walls and clothing for all ages and most of all excess and abundance There s no abundance here I ve found items I like but I am not impressed with the collection Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items and I think it is taking advantage of the fact fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money I feel a little cheated If you must have this wait until the price drops or better yet find a good reputable fan site there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads and download for a small fee or for free 
Where s the glamour This pack offered very little of anything The decor very little of it is uninspired I was hoping to get some good artwork at least I know a lot of people don t like to download from fan sites but don t waste your money on this junk Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy 
USC Texas 2005 OK so where the heck is Vince Young Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush in this version You see Reggie Bush on the cover so you think you re going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl But none of these players are to be found In fact Ohio State is listed as the 1 team Am I behind the times Or is this how EA Sports does their football games Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime I was hoping to be able to play them with updated abilities that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005 Any ideas out there Is this a code or a cheat I need to unlock HELP 
50 Not worth it IT S THE SAME GAME AS 05 AND 06 I was reading that 8000 word review by Dave Jeanclerc and I strongly disagree with some of his points P S My review has nothing to do with the XBox 360 version which apparently is awesome I HAVE PLAYING THE EA FOOTBALL GAMES SINCE THE MID 90 S and I m sick of paying 50 for the same game every year EA Games owns the rights to the college and NFL teams so you won t see any football games by any other game companies most noteably SEGA who revolutionized football simulation games in the late 80 s NCAA Football 07 is basically the same as NCAA Football 2002 and 2003 and 2004 and 05 and 06 Each year EA adds a little tweak to the mix but overall it s the same look the same feel the same moves the same everything This year they ve changed the way you kick the ball and added more defensive audibles that s it There are a few other minor adjustments but none are worth noting IMO In fact the audibles they added are the EXACT SAME audibles you used to have on Sega s ESPN Football 2005 you can call audibles for individual defensive players Thieves Everything else is THE EXACT SAME AS 05 and 06 The most disappointing thing graphically speaking is the crowd it still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison just like it did on games made 10 years ago OH one other big change the improved momentum meter If you thought it was ridiculous last year wait til you play NCAA 07 The momentum meter has such a strong influence on the game that if you make ONE OFFENSIVE MISTAKE in the beginning of the game you re doomed that s it You can t win For example I played FSU vs UM twice The first time I made no 1st half errors and pounded the Hurricanes 31 10 I played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff giving the Hurricanes the ball at my 35 yd line and I lost the game 45 24 That fumble was my ONLY MISTAKE of the game NESSLER HERBSTRIET AND CORSO ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME EXACT IN GAME COMMENTS THEY WERE SAYING IN 05 AND 06 GIMME A BREAK Also the AI is still atrocious Defensively the computer controlled team is hapless They blitz on every down In fact I ve lined up numerous times for a 3rd and long with 4 or 5 receivers and the defense continually loads 8 men in the box they don t even put enough DB s out there to stop me It s basically a game of long bombs If you choose a team with good receivers you can easily throw for 400+ yards a game by continually going deep THE SAFETIES ALWAYS BLITZ The safeties only drop back into coverage if you have 3rd and 20+ or 4th and 15+ So how does the computer couteract your deep balls Easy when the momentum meter swings against your favor your receivers drop EVERY BALL YOU THROW AT THEM even if you hit them in the chest with the ball and when you finally decide to run the ball your RUNNING BACK FUMBLES THE BALL IMMEDIATELY I played a game between USC and Cal and I kept switching to play with the team that DIDN T have the momentum and I ended up turning the ball over on every possession You may be reading this and saying Hey this guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out No not really it s exactly how I ve played the 05 and 06 game and the same glitches I ve encountered in them too EA has really dropped the ball again You are paying 50 to get updated rosters and in typical EA fashion you don t even have names for any of the players just different skill levels EA games suck Their soccer games are horrible their basketball games are too slow and awkward and they don t update their football games I GUARANTEE YOU THAT MADDEN 07 WILL BE THE SAME AS MADDEN 06 JUST WATCH And by the way EA has gone all out on the XBox 360 editions of NCAA 07 ans Madden 07 I m sure those versions will be stunning The rest of us are paying the same price for last year s game 
Garbage Typical Xbox game using checkpoints instead of creativity to make it challenging Nothing more mind numbing than doing the same thing over and over again because you keep getting killed right before the next checkpoint Granted you can get hours and hours of playing time from it but only about 25 is something that you haven t already done 10 times before I highly recommend this game to people who are of the intellect that enjoy working on production lines where they do same thing repeatedly If your brain actually requires some kind of stimulation find a more creative game In addition some actions tend to be a bit uncooperative at times such as when attempting to knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting to get shot Apparently if you aren t facing in just the perfect position when attempting smash his brains out you stand there like a manakin hoping the guy two inches in front of you doesn t notice Another option is to try and shoot him but unless you get a head shot expect to fire of gobs of rounds to take him out since you seem to be armed with what can only be a 22 short pistol 
this game sucks nothing more really needs to be said I m running a 3GHz P4 256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer I tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect DO NOT BUY THIS GAM 
Repetitive boring The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush Assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy s platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI Since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building s aspect Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay Unlike the previous version of B W there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features Cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of Age of Empires 
Not great The game itself is very interesting the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique It s an RPG which is quite a switch for Mario The major problem with this game is interactivity not enough of it Specifically there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable Many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle it takes about 10 minutes to get to the real fight from the prior save point This isn t a problem for the first time through the sequence but if you lose 4 or 5 times this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end This is a major problem that most game designers have found work arounds for but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element It s an interesting game but just make sure to win or have a friend sibling enemy skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them 
Not for Everyone All I have to say is this game is not for EVERYONE you have to be able to READ to play Last time I checked not everyone can read I bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum He can master just about every game I get him but he can t read So for him this game was not much fun I ended up playing more than he did and I didn t even enjoy it 
Not Gonna Cut It with games such as Grand theft auto San Andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this won t cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at EB games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play GTA or true crime instea 
Should have been alot better I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad The story line was basically typical it really didn t hold my interest for long I did beat the game because I spent 50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did It s worth renting but definately not worth buying Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls 
sucks sucks this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you like I said just a waste of time plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead and they said it took then a long time to make this game this game should have never been release 
sucks sucks this game is really bad I mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam 
Fair Warning Rent it before you buy Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid I was looking forward to playing this The graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot VR quot points becomes annoying after awhile The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that s with playing with a PS2 gun I can t imagine shooting with a controller which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot VR quot points The dialog gets annoying too and you can t skip hearing it either 
HORRIBLE CLIPPING ISSUES This game has a great design and excellent fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn t respond quickly to the commands The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat This CAN be a fun game just don t play the PC version Borrow someone s Xbox and play that version This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right 
I beat this game in a matter of a few hours I thougt there would be a better story line and what I found was very disappointing The boss McGruder was easier to beat than the boss in the Matrix Path to neo I mean I paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously I was wrong 
Cheaper at BestBuy com Don t buy this here it is selling for 49 99 at Best Buy bestbuy com Wait until they lower the price on Amazon 
Not likeable by 3 year old I rented this game for my 3 year old Who loves the movie He tried to play it He like it I tried to play it got to the dancing part I couldn t get past it I tried for 5 days My rental time was up I returned it I haven t rented it since This game is way too hard to beat And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast I would NOT recommend this game to anyone Don t waste your money buying it Unless you are an expert with video games I m just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it 
Dancing almost impssible I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn t get past it don t waste your time or patience with this annoying game 
Very buggy and incomplete Pointless quests with no real conclusions CTD every 30 45 minutes Lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment All in all a VERY unpolished product even with the patch If your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game 
EEEKS Point and Click Yawn Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG Shooters BUT I cant believe this is a point and click game I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill The days of Boulder s Gate point n click should be over but I guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay Still a good game but dissapointed 
disgraceful lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why the first was very good 
TERRIBLE GAME I BOUGHT THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS 50 BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAME I WAS WRONG YOU DONT GET A LIGHTSABRE UNTIL FAR INTO THE GAME AND ALL THE ADVERTISMENTS SHOWS YOU WITH A LIGHTSABRE THE GAME IS EXTREMELY BUGGY AND HAS POOR GRAPHICS I AM A HUGE STARWARS FAN AND WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A STARWARS FAN THEY ARE DONT BUY THIS GAME 
Not the best First off i just want to say that i ve read The Secret of the Old Clock and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it which i can understand But I m 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring The puzzles were way too easy and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people i didnt get anything Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste 19 00 on it I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games 
strictly for kids only i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here s an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children s word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i couldn t progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i didn t want to i m not saying it s a bad game it s just probably not a good game for grownups 
Boring and Tedious Sure the graphics and sound ARE nice but this game is very linear and very forgiving too forgiving You can save and reload just about constantly so long as there aren t monsters nearby and things are made kinda dummy proof so you can t make any significant mistakes As a result I never really felt like I was taking much of a chance doing anything The dialogue is mostly a matter of clicking responses until you can t click anymore and there s not much bad consequence to clicking them in any ol order There s really only one path through the different areas of the game and nothing ever respawns You can also adjust the difficulty levels from very easy to very difficult but the experience and treasure don t adjust accordingly This means if a fight is too tough after a couple reloads you can make it very easy and still get the same rewards you would have gotten when it was hard lt yawn gt Maybe I m just a little jaded from playing online games like Everquest for so long In online realtime games with other humans playing around you there is much more of an unpredictable and more importantly uncontrolable and much more exciting environment to play in I got so bored with this that I actually stopped playing while close to completing the very last area of the game I just didn t care anymore This game requires very little thinking or strategizing 
A great concept gets ruined On paper the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea and upon first glance of it it seems like it s firing on all cylinders Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles Kiefer Sutherland Dennis Haysbert Elisa Cuthbert etc and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show 24 The Game falls apart once you get further into it The missions are repetitive the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched and the controls are unresponsive to say the least Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you Some of this could be forgiveable but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels It s a shame too considering how innovative the series was in it s early life and everything the game had going for it If more polish was put into it 24 The Game could have been something special but as it is it s only recommended as a rental for fans of the series 
This game is pretty pour I guess the first thing i ll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game I was HUGELY dissaponted I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought There are way to many puzzles I don t mind puzzles but there are simply way to many And some on them are insainly hard I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight Jedi Academy way better the puzzles aren t insain and you get to choose what you look like and well I could go on but i ll leave it there If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is 20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game Just don t get this game 
Pretty Useless I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller you must use the remote control When you take the dongle out with a DVD in a screen will come up telling to reinsert so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction then you ve just wasted thirty bucks I feel quite ripped off With the low cost of DVDs nowadays it s a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO you can get a good progressive scan for about 30 or 40 which comes out to about the same price As a side it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can t turn on or off the device with the remote you must go up to box to do it yourself especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives 
DVDs don t play DVD s which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or don t play when I try to play them on the XBOX Don t waste your money on this buy a stand alone DVD player instead so you won t have the frustration that I ve had 
DON T buy this This remote is of awful quality i ve been through two of them in the past year I wouldn t complain so much if it didn t cost 30 It s worth ten at most Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player rather than using the xbox 
so so The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game My daughter has played them all However after a while it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery However this game took her two days All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed In fact her words at the end of the game were that s it Her interactive better come out with a more interesting game next time or you ll lose the interest 
Disapointing for a Nancy Drew game Seems like they just huried this game Too much running around to get answers The phone did not even have web acsess Actually i did not like it at all 
Disappointed My daughter and I have played all of the previous games we ve enjoyed them overall Some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun This game was quite lame in comparison to the others The puzzles weren t really puzzling just boring tasks There were not many clues to find Because there weren t many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything The game ended abruptly and was very short We did NOT use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally The rest was pretty boring If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game try one of the others instead 
Way too short and repetitive The review by Bovey is spot on These games have gotten more boring as they go The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough There was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom And the game was so short suddenly it ended I am so disappointed in what these games have become I loved The Final Scene I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough This game was just lame I don t recommend paying full price for it 
Very Disappointing I ve been a fan of these games since the first one Secrets Can Kill came out I ve played them all I m not at all sure what s happened to the games though While the graphics have steadily improved the puzzles plot and gameplay have really gone downhill The first game Secrets Can Kill had pretty horrific graphics but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it Things really picked up with the second game Stay Tuned for Danger Better graphics and a very interesting story very cool puzzles great plot I can absolutely recommend Games 2 Stay Tuned for Danger 3 Message in a Haunted Mansion 4 Treasure in the Royal Tower 5 The Final Scene 6 Secret of the Scarlet Hand 7 Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake 9 Danger on Deception Island and 10 Secret of Shadow Ranch These games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles Lots of areas where you can snoop around which I really enjoy Game 8 The Haunted Carousel is interesting and has wonderful graphics but is awfully short I did not at all enjoy 11 Curse of Blackmoor Manor as I found it way too difficult I also cannot really recommend 12 Secret of the Old Clock It was too short and repetitive I did somewhat enjoy 13 Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and 14 Danger by Design but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles And now we have 15 Outstanding graphics but way too short The amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy I don t mind Nancy running about doing errands to help people for that I thought Games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced But I like each task to be different and interesting Not mind numbingly repetitive and boring This seems to be a factor of the more recent games delivering telegrams in Game 12 painting pictures in Game 14 and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game I miss looking for clues Putting together evidence for a purpose I miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game It seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took X number of hours to complete I also miss learning useful things In 1 I learned about American Sign Language In 3 I learned about Chinese symbols and the San Francisco earthquake In 4 I learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant works In 6 I learned SO much about the Maya and how to work a HAM radio In 7 I learned about Roman Numerals and Prohibition In 8 I learned how to make invisible writing In 9 I learned how to work a HAM radio and about Pacific Northwest sea animals After that well I didn t really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games If you ve never played a Nancy Drew game please please PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games although probably not the very first one the graphics aren t as good and switching discs can be highly annoying But give 2 9 a try you won t be disappointed Oh please Her Interactive PLEASE go back to the way they used to be structured I d gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot cohesion or integrated interesting puzzles 
Disappointment Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games Shadow Ranch the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Secret of the Old Clock etc The game was short and I thought the tasks were a bit dull I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time because these games really are addictive even for adults 
Square Enix I expected more from you this game has a 25 minute introduction or story Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good However I do expect them to put something like Skip Intro cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories I however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that This is only a minor flaw Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears Very annoying but again a minor flaw This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again It get very boring after awhile You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle 1 0 3 5 terrible 3 6 5 bad 5 1 6 5 average 6 6 8 good 8 1 9 great 9 1 10 must buy excellent graphics 9 10 great sound 9 10 some voice acting but great fun 5 10 depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over again average about 8 my grade 7 goo 
Is this a game or a just a really boring story I had read pretty good reviews about this game so I bought it I was hoping for something with a little action with an interesting storyline What I got was probably the most boring game I have ever played The introduction prolouge lasts about 7 minutes or so including the credits You cannot break out and move on After you set down your PSP and grab a drink you come back and find that there is one short battle for you to play Then you go back to the story The characters have long annoying conversations and you get to press X at the end of each of their sentances Again no way to break out no in game menu for you to manage the game You have to go through each painfully slow dialog box until the chapter is over This game is really bad Maybe it gets a little more interesting it is possible that there is actually something for you to do besides watch the characters argue It is really slow and it is all about the storyline and the dialog There does not appear to be any freeplay If you have played this type of game before and you enjoy that style of play then you might like it I was bored and frustrated from the first minute 
AAAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHHHHH Pretty much sums up how I felt after 15 minutes of introductory waffle hellishly annoying bingy bongy music and admittedly very pretty cut scenes totally emotionless voice overs impossibly slow conversations that served little or no point And to be honest at that point it was either switch off the psp or throw it against a wall I decided to switch it off Now I m a big fan of adventure games played untold legends 1 till it gave up on me literally left hanging around with nothing to do and no more quests on offer From what I can gather the in game graphics for Valkyrie after 15 minutes though it seemed like much longer I d seen some really cool character graphics bit like tekken DR in game graphics and some of those horrible 2d munchkin japanese rpg graphics which are the in game stuff So the bit you play looks like it s 20 years old and should be on a gba the cutscenes are nice but there will no doubt be far too many of those ie 5 minutes of slow cut scenes for every encounter I can t say this is a proper review as I couldn t stand this title long enough to get to any actual gameplay and there s no way I m sitting through that intro again My advice if you like the long winded old style walk and talk for three hours before actually doing anything japanese rpgs Get this or better still go to an antiques shop and find an old text adventure If you prefer a game where you actually play the character and do stuff avoid this like the plague I ve got high hopes for dungeon siege when it comes out but then I had high hopes for valkyrie too but for now untold legends 2 is okay not as good as it should have been but a helluva lot more fun than valkyrie I would like to point out that I ve never played on a ps2 xbox or game cube so this is the first time I ve seen a valkyrie profile game I didn t have any preconceptions obviously if I had I d never have gone anywhere near this title in the first place 
This Game Is Frustrating I love the idea behind this game and it s pretty impressively exectuted I had three gripes though 1 It s so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 I couldn t get the magnify and reduce with quick little circles to work This caused me great frustration 3 There s no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times I quit playing it pretty quickly 
Trauma Center DS will cause you to go to the ER This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do As the patients vital signs drops you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do The nurse who assists you gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you ve failed the mission It would take me an average of 10 15 failures before I finally won a mission The last mission I played that made me quit resulted in 30+ failures And that s only being 1 hour and half into the game The graphics are crisp and clear The storyline didn t make much of an impression on me But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients game collector who will keep it sealed or you re a gultton for punishment Whatever you do do not buy this game for the hype It does not live up to it 
I thought as a non gaming female I might like this game To me this game was seriously disappointing So disappointing I didn t finish the second case before setting it down forever I was highly entertained at first It s cute funny and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining However it quickly got older 1 You can t skip through the horrendously long dialog ever Even after you ve heard it about a million times because you re clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do 2 I found myself looking for an internet walk through yes on this simplistic game I couldn t figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you ve read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level 3 Possible Spolier There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium After that I just couldn t take it any more and gave up 4 The places and people never change For each case from my understanding it s all the exact same tiny few places I m not a big gamer but I like a world bigger than three feet I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me Just to help this review I m a college age female and this is my first gaming console although I ve played the PS2 quite a bit Maybe it s really a hit or miss but I don t really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level A REALLY high patience level 
A Weak Nintendo System This GameCube is WEAK I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems Nintendo s recent system the GameCube has several problems with it s design First of all the internal fan is slow but quiet After an hour or so of use the system overheats thus shuts down Second problem the wireless controllers for this system SUCK We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week The brands we have tried Pelican Intec Nintendo and Osmart The third problem is that the system was not built to last I still have the NES and Nintendo 64 which both work great I doubt the GameCube will last past 4 5 years of use Simply put DON T BUY THIS PRODUCT ALSO The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon From the description and from the specs you will need to stand up and interact move around and stuff with the game Sounds fun but would you like to do that after a hard day of work It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy 
Great overall but it needs work This game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people 
Very boring quite playing after 2 days I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs and lamely fighting rats The interface is terrible You are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you can t even carry your treasure back to town This game was all work with no fun Do not buy 
beware there are pros and cons of this card PROS its stores a lot of memory able to save many files at one time compact affordable CONS games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car 
A Pretty Good Device for the Casual Gamecube Owner Make no mistake this is the memory card for you if you ve got a Gamecube which I m assuming you do or you re planning on getting one soon Anyway there are 251 blocks on this baby which may not seem like a lot but it is It gets the job done and you don t have to worry about it corrupting data or anything I ve had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there It s also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button Please don t get that damn third party memory card from Madcatz my experience with that is corrupted data and constant reformating of the card which erases your files anyway Only go with Nintendo they re the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card I must say though this is for the casual gamer Someone who doesn t have every game they can possibly get a hold of Some EA games for exammple take up over one hundred blocks of memory Basically what I m saying is simple If you re one who has a ton of games you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it Not every game has a save for just the game Resident Evil for example saves on a different block every time Just like a playstation memory card If you re like me however you probably don t have THAT many games that it s a bother The other thing I must caution is simple This thing like every other memory card is small as hell This one even more so If you can keep it plugged in your Gamecube at all times The great thing about memory cards just about everyone of them is simple You can take them anywhere Does your same friend also own Super Mario Sunshine Hey that s great now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card It lightens the load It s essential to have a memory card if you buy a Gamecube and this is a good one If however you happen to be someone who has a TON of games this won t hold you over long enough and you ll have to buy another No Gamecube owner should be without a memory card though 
Imperfect is right Remember all those countless super hero licensed beat em up s that plagued 16 bit systems At first glance EA s Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects might not seem like that type of game but make no mistake that it is a repetitive and quickly boring beat em up with a host of technical issues You can play as a variety of Marvel Comics heroes and villains as well as six Imperfects cyborg esque warriors created specifically for the game The single player mode is ungodly repetitive as you battle hordes of generically created enemies This gets boring real quick with button mashing galore and repetitive gameplay The destructable environments seem like a good plus at first but you ll soon learn how much they actually work against you in a brawl and it becomes more frustrating than it should be The cumbersome control scheme adds to this not to mention that the controls can get to be quite buggy as well The graphics look sharp from a distance but the game has an odd look to it like it doesn t know if it wants to look like Spider Man 2 or Ultimate Spider Man both are great games that are much more worth your time than this and the in game cut scenes look godawful There are a few saving graces which save Marvel Nemesis from being a complete clunker including a horde of unlockable content that comic fans will love The Marvel heroes super powers are nicely pulled off including Storm s weather attacks and Daredevil s agility and the online support is where the most fun from the game is to be had Other than that though there s not much else here to hold your interest If you re looking for a great super hero game check out the X Men Legends series or the aforementioned Ultimate Spider Man If you re looking for a great beat em up check out Rockstar s the Warriors all of which are more worthwhile than this 
Nancy s Train Ride was Short Lived This review is in reference to Nancy Drew Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide edition I ve played 3 or 4 of the Drew games This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game Before I had installed Blue Moon Canyon I had installed Morrowind the Game of the Year Edition which sold for five dollars less than Blue Moon Canyon Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has at the bare minimum 400 hours of gameplay and possibly might literally be endless The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15 20 minutes After I had installed and played Blue Moon Canyon we installed and got up and running Age of Mythology Gold also within 20 minutes This is another massive game a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack The Titans Both Mythology games were completely installed This is another game that can be played and explored for years The two game set sold for five dollars more than Blue Moon Canyon or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon took so long to download we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone We have a P4 at 3 2Ghz an 80GB HD of which only 23GB were used and 1 5 GB of RAM There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long over an hour to download unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super Multi Drive drivers The actual installation was not as painful as the download What was painful was the gameplay I had a lot of fun playing the Secret of the Old Clock Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game I liked playing the golf game and the car chase and the bank shots of reflective light beams to be aligned I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed I knew that the Drew games wouldn t deliver the value that the two games mentioned above did But after the reading the reviews of Blue Moon I expected to have more fun than I did with Secret even though I knew it would be short lived What a let down The game was over in two or three hours Most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over or which way the track leaned to The arcade games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case click the mouse You didn t even have to look The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing It was very boring Between the price the concern over the length of the download the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train I cannot recommend this game as being fun It had a few moments with the Math scale problems but it wasn t enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to I realize I m an adult but the eight year old little girl I bought it for lost interest after the first 15 minutes She was wiser than I Sorry Nance this one is a waste of money and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts marf 
clue chronicles i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i 
Hasbro Clueless on Cusotmer Service We recommend not buying this game unless you don t mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can t be fixed Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available Save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free 
Save your money I bought this game about a week ago I had not purchased the prequil sp to this game and did not know what to expect I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30 45 minutes later I have no played the game since Here s why The graphics to me are ridiculously annoying It makes the game feel so unrealistic The graphics are a step lower than NBA Street and even more unrealistic The real problem is that there is just nothing to do You enter tournements and they all feel the same The little side missions are laughable and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them I can go on and on about why I hated this game But I won t The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game but don t let that happen to you 
Do Not Purchase After playing this game for the third time I had a thought WHY DID I BUY THIS This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street s Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game 
kings quest poor quality out of box you can only play KQ7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is 
Lies My gripe is about KQ6 One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions This information is false At the time of its origional release I was fortunate to have a high end computer for its time that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 maybe 98 Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset 
Great Game BAD EDITION I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop OOPS they didn t update any of the drivers for the first two games Kings Quest 1 2 so after about 15 minutes of playing you can t see the screen due to all of the graphic errors There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn t look like any are on the way I feel pretty ripped off It says on the cover in big print Runs on Windows XP Barely and not very well when it does If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed Better yet download one of the fan made editions for free online They work 
A bad knock off Hey have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s Yeah well this game is basically a knock off of that game with better graphics And quite frankly Caesar II was more fun I don t see how CivCity has any point You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh The makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series but they are inconsequential in this game These people should stick to what they are good at the Civilization series and leave city games to people who know how to do it I ve heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now Caesar IV and I haven t tried it but it has to be better than CivCity Rome This game is boring don t pay any money for it 
rip off I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension WRONG this is a bad rip off of Caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control This is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they ll stay Caesar IV that s what you re wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn t Feel like I ve wasted my money 
Sadly disappointed I was really looking forward to this game and I was prepared to overlook one or two things Every game has it s own personality right I found instead this game actually doesn t have much of one at all I didn t mind the graphics Not cutting edge sure but not that bad either A little muddy but a change from cartoony It was hard to enjoy closeup views however when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom No way to toggle that feature The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately Not that there was much time to look at the scenery Immigrants came And came And came Whether there were houses and jobs available or not As long as city happiness was high enough which meant that everyone was happy Which they were not Because they had no houses or jobs To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy Forget planning Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets It wasn t clear what the balance was in any case It would take trial and error and you didn t have the time For you were building worshops like mad trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade It was through research maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on You hit those early on and reached a certain population level you made money The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving There was no stability in reaching any level It quickly became a game of keep up There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development And for all the decorative options more than the similar games out you really didn t care in the end what your city looked like because it just cost time Money too but that was really not the relevant issue Unless people were unhappy Then you could stick a few things quickly somewhere You just can t enjoy a leisurely pace of planning building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run you have to be constantly involved in the process staying ahead of the curve You don t have to worry about maintenance such as city fires or engineers but the cities cannot not be made self sufficient or self sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities if not all to a screeching halt While I enjoyed the research options and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying 
Guilty by Association The Civ name has been tarnished Analogously one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier s name is on a product it doesn t mean the product is good In the case of CivCity Rome unfortunately it doesn t just come in at modestly good it comes in at dismally poor I ve tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general but after Civ4 came out I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out And now this I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago The offerings of today have a simple pattern the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release they take advantage of our love for the franchise This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating It almost seems especially with the release of CivCity Rome that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games Stay away from CivCity Rome Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good the narration and sound effects better or the interface to work properly The game is a dismal failure and I am sorry to report that It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis but they just cheesed it Watching what Maxis The Sims and SimCity franchises and Firaxis Civilization franchise are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
Don t Waste Your Money It has pretty much all been said let s just say it again cause I m sure Firaxis Firefly will plant positive reviews here The game takes ages to load the voice acting is silly British Australian Herman s Hermits the progression is totally linear ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels the graphics date to 2002 and the citizen fetching system is completely random and opaque Sit and watch for awhile your huts will change size every thirty seconds Most importantly boo Sid boo You could ve produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything but you called it CivCity and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it Haven t you got enough money The Civ Series is brilliant Don t cash it in 
Disappointing The games faults have been well covered already so I ll just say if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably 
Wait for it to hit the discount bins Like the other reviews I find this game a rip off of Caesare III I didn t know there was a IV Must look into that While the graphics are admirable the gameplay wasn t challenging at all It didn t take me any time at all to win and I m one of the worst game players ever OTOH it s a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals Don t buy it now Wait until it s cheap like 9 95 or something 
Just get Oblivion instead Graphics aren t the most important part of a game to me I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature Oblivion style RPG While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion I never got to see it because of the bad controls bad collision and lack of fun By bad collision I m talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease The controls make combat an unfun chore I m a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion If you ve never played Oblivion and don t have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it then maybe you ll get into Gothic 2 It has much lower system requirements 
Pretty overrated The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING I m a long time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme Plus for all the people talking about immersion I just don t see it I just couldn t get myself to care about the world or story I was in it didn t grab me like some games do 
What a disappointment Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it Clunky control system really put me off 
Useless buggy recognition code The concept for this game is strong and it s got some cute ideas but the voice recognition especially for the word blue and the character recognition is abysmal It makes the game an exercise in frustration more than anything else As to character recognition unless you write in whatever font the game is programmed to recognize it s going to record your answers as something different than what you wrote You are penalized when the system doesn t recognize blue or the correct number If the system is so rigid that it only accepts one way of saying blue then the system should have a sound file that tells you what it wants to hear As to the number recognition it should have a screen that shows you how the system wants the numbers written or it should be able to allow you to enter your numbers and correlate them to numbers within the system When I make this mark it = 4 Also the intro content is absurdly long with no way to skip over it Huge waste of time after the first 10x you ve seen it I just got the game today and I ve spent hours trying to figure out a way to say blue such that the game will recognize it now I just wish I could return opened software I m very frustrated with the entire experience 
Could be a lot funner Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century Though many of the novels were very well written they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book Icewind Dale II is like that It looks nice it supposedly improves gameplay and it gives the player more character creation options but I just don t really want to play it Why Well at the end of the day it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly it is just not as fun as its predescessor I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur s Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option I was wrong I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarassing to take part in I was confronted with gameplay that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored I tried to play it again but again I was plagued with the same problems I installed a bunch of unofficial patches but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur s Gate II where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path Furthermore the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale In fact the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb I was mostly familiar with the rules but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive All in all I do not think that this is a good game I would just go with Baldur s Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game 
A great disappointment Firstly I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games I loved BG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequal to which I found to be honest awful I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd with the exception of NWN but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn t bother me much It s a computer game after all the exact mechanics of the system I dont have to understand The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs It got to the point where I could simply leave my game runing for an hour or two while my chacters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned criters It got boring really fast Not too mention difficult as well The really sad part was when I read the general plot outline I was enthusiastic I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade But when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army this is the point where in pen and paper RPG s that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it 
Gotta give em credit for creativity This game looked so crazy I couldn t resist it I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much but in the USA it s just insane On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids game but aren t games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it s just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama It s like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game Planet Alice in Wonderland consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die The worst of it is respawning monsters you can t take a step without having to fight and re fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated Because of this you ll spend the majority of your money on healing items Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill 30 minutes is normal Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game I know that Kingdom Hearts 2 Mushashi Samurai Legend and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past 
So Stupid Now before you say anything I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster grudgingly playing it though and now for the unbaiased opinion I think that this game is so completely stupid It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion 
Shipping sucks ass I really could not tell you anything as I still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago 
More like Chrono Crap Please promise me you will never play this It is not worth your time If you paid money for it try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin Hard Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster Seriously though this game is absolutely terrible The graphics are bad even for the PSX the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless There was no reason for there being 40 something characters most of them were exactly the same statwise and all of them were poorly designed The most annoying thing in the world bar nothing is having to re equip all your character s spells whenever you switch characters You have like 50 spell slots God I don t think I even need to say it but those crumbums at Square couldn t pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on lest they risk making something like this again 
Difficult visually The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar we rented it It s very hard to control the c stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn t rotate the camera except for certain times The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c stick to zoom in it still wasn t close enough It s the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly Another aspect we didn t like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor Maybe we re spoiled because the c stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions It s surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite 
For experienced players I loved The Incredibles so I was excited to play the game I ve only been playing video games the last couple years and only off and on so I m really just a beginner Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I ve had with this game My boyfriend is a long time video game player and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy I almost cried LOL But seriously unless you are a good gamer you re probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game As for me I guess I ll stick to action RPGs 
the key they gave me didn t work hi it was impossible to use this product because the key they gave me didn t work i might make a fisbee out of the dvd jerr 
Like europe politics it stinks Bought this Platinum game with much anticipation and it doesn t work at all Tried the download exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too No one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game If they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like Blizzard does and companies like Westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company or its affiliates I think they are Alkida implants trying to take over the western world If you want to play a game with style then wait until June and get Titan s Quest which should be finally a Diablo 3 Too bad this company couldn t find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy Spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new Patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to Iran 
No Starforce but does not work I have a pretty decent computer Athlon64 3000+ Radeon X550 but this game does not work at all Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the CPU until I kill the process Aspyr support is unable to help That said despite other reviews here this game does NOT install Starforce But maybe that s why my version won t work 
TOTAL JIP this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at ALL i hate this game so MUCH it is literally the worst DBZ game i have ever played and i have played them all i advise you if ur looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER 
Good Game But I Just Didn t Enjoy It There is nothing majorly wrong with this game The plot is well developed the characters are customizable and the battles are strategic This is probably primarily subjective but I just didn t enjoy this game It s not because there were too many movies it s because I didn t like the movie I also didn t like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure Which button to press was often counterintuitive and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button Also the game badly needs a journal and or a destination guide so you know where to go I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go 
BECAUSE ZERO ISN T POSSIBLE I actually recieved this from a friend of mine which he bought for 0 98 Anyway I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting but were only sold over in the UK and so on He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader So I took it home and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2 and just recieved it today to my surprise not actually the damn thing didn t work Now I m stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD s DON T BUY THIS PRODUCT It is junk However I am thankful that I didn t even buy this product but it was given to me I hope that someone planning on buying this reads my review first IT S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY

Order now and we ll throw in a set of premium steak knives FROM AMAZON CA The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer VGE or at least it claims to be My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region free DVD player and a memory card compression utility squeeze more saves onto your memory card I have not used either of these features personally but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards some reusable some permanently damaged This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it However the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I ll get to those in a second The ARMax like the newer Gamesharks loads its software from a CD This is a major annoyance for me Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card which does I don t know what and CD go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load choose your codes then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load You can t simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it If you wanted it to load before the game you turned on its switch Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way and it s not btw it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first I mean why can t the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you re playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don t have to load the software EVERY D MN TIME Ok rant over On to the codes The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark Functionally they are very similar of course but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions not for user entered ones though if I remember right and a more robust Expert Mode On big advantage in theory that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2 s broadband connection The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download its all or nothing And since these updates are stored on your memory card not the ARMax one it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99 of which you will NEVER play No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card It s to store all the useless codes Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work do nothing or lock up the game I have come across all though to ARMax s credit mostly the former The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library when you may want just one loses the ARMax another star A note about manually entering codes The sub headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game s code list Finally as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols Amazon ca the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL This happened for me as well I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions at the time of ARMax I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine I assume any bought today would not have this problem However at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars In my opinion if you re in the market for a VGE both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have Looks at the specs assume nothing and don t be afraid to e mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about I apologize for the length of this review but I find there are very few in depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs I don t know 
Don t buy it will corrupt your files and lose saves I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a USB flash drive I have not been able to get either to work correctly After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card It also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 I have had nothing but trouble with it it s slow and doesn t live up to the promises Their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry Well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves 
This thing actually has a use now I honestly do not like cheat devices but since Wild Arms 4 came out it actually now has a use Let me explain Unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing the company that translated Wild Arms 4 it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a Gameshark Since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you ll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this If it wasn t for this reason I wouldn t even be interested in this product 
If you have the newer slim ps2 design then Then this will not work on your console But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark 
Garbage As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recomend it to any one I do not know why it was ever released Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers 
don t buy this I bought this from Best Buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my Xbox360 a longer life and keep it s insides cool When I plugged it in my Xbox360 didn t turn on AT ALL After trying it several times I took it off and plugged in the AC adapter back on to my Xbox For a while the Xbx wouldn t turn on I thought it was broken I gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that Intercooler nearly broke my Xbox DON T BUY IT 
Broken Pointless First of all it s sad that someone would put out a product the 360 that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans Second I attached this I plugged it in It wouldn t even turn on Waste of money Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area If you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it 
Killed my 360 aswell Stay away from this product my intercooler while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months but i continously got random red circles of death until my 360 got another one today and couldnt recover This product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first Terrible product that cost me 140 and a whole month without my xbox while i wait for it to be repaired 
I d give 0 stars if I could The intercooler can and in my case did damage my 360 It sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360 which caused component failure The worst part As it s not an approved accessory for the 360 any damage it causes will void your warranty and you ll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket 
Nyko Intercooler I was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system I sent it back and got another one The second intercooler did not work either It makes a nice paperweight 
Keep it simple buy a little fan There are WAY too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a 400 360 Putting any kind of power drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble I own a lot of expensive electronics and I d never do it in a million years Instead of taking such a chance go to your local retailer and buy a little fan 4 6 designed for placing clipping depending on how you ve got your Xbox set up on your desk at work etc You can get one for 5 10 and don t have to worry about leeching power from your 360 Just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top Since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill you can shop for one that s quiet and fits your setup My 360 actually runs quite cool although I do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier ps Always always always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible NEVER put anything on top ALWAYS place on a hard surface and ALWAYS leave at least a few inches clearance all around Lastly ALWAYS use a surge suppressor 
Better to Rent than Buy I played this game until Chapter 23 All the Dancing Levels were VERY HARD to beat I think this game is not worth buying rent it 
Holy Hannah Please tell me there is a cheat for level 3 My son begged for this game and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection He enjoyed levels 1 2 but once we got to level 3 that was it Unless you have earned the nickname Fast fingers or Fury Feet don t bother purchasing this until you rent it I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible about 57 accurate as I did actually keeping up Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the Dance Levels get harder from here Good Luck 
rated N for nobody This game is a joke It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them Don t buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out It is was a waste of money my kids won t even play it It should be rated N for Nobody 
As bad if not worse than the movie The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun The kids didn t even like it Run don t walk away from this dentist office of a game JAWS cr p JAWS = Just another W Smith 
weak movie weak game my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i 
Might be great if it worked We have been unsuccessful with this e reader attachment since we purchased it Cards read once and never again Doesn t matter if we use the GB SP or Advance Still doesn t do anything Don t recommend you waste your money 
The good and the bad mostly bad It s got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had The Good Unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving The Bad Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story 
This game is totally inappropriate We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play After watching my son play this game for a few minutes I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive Then after that he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died I can t believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids or whoever played it have to be so mean to animals What s next ripping the head off a rabbit I consider myself one of the coolest moms around but this totally crossed the line 
Repetitive and tedious I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar For starters I ve always been irritated with games that don t let you save your status whenever you want Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay but that s not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save That contributes to the repetitive tedious nature of some sections If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game you re doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game More than in the earlier versions however I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task Another tedious element I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun 
EA should have quit while ahead I purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn t run it I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone It worked They win They got my money and I got jack 
buyer beware The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system press 2 now EA s manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes I could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund I would never buy another EA product 
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT I bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that I need one for each GBA or SP So I bought another one for my son Then after we couldn t get them to work consulted Nintendo we found that the wireless adapter doesn t work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version Some gift 
Less than ideal I have always been a fan of fighting games As far as 3D ones go I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2 I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5 Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example Her idle animation is preposterous If you have access to Dead or Alive 3 try putting out Leifang Her idle animation is a thing of beauty Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5 And now let us speak of character design Tekken 5 s characters are boring and uninspired They run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer 1 2 3 and 4 to miscellaneous karate fighter 1 2 3 and 4 Oh There are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing some of which seem to be Asian if that s your thing And then there s a guy in a cat mask As awesome as that sounds it looks silly in the game If you have ever played Practice Mode on Dead or Alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move This feature as useful as it is is not present in Tekken 5 To be fair it isn t found in any other fighting game that I have played but it really should be Without further ado let me simply say that I do not recommend buying Tekken 5 if you have ever played Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive The intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer I especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten But at least Mortal Kombat Deception had Puzzle Kombat which rocked my socks 
Can be very frustrating Sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss Jinpachi is really cheap and lame Even at the easy difficulty just a couple of hits from this freak and you re dead The Devil Within mini game is also stupid some levels are just impossible and too hard I wouldn t mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here not to mention some save points are hidden Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can t save your game then you re gonna have to redo the entire level again That is one sick stupid game design The only reason I m playing this mini game is just to get the hidden items 
Absolutely Boring At First When I Got It It Seemed Fun Then As The Minutes Go By It Got Boring Quick The Missions Suck The Bosses Are Too Hard I Just Sold My Game If You Buy This Game You ll Be Doing The Sam 
Stinker I really liked the first two Jak games so I was excited to try Jak 3 Whoa Major mistake This game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe I was very disappointed in this game If you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere 
obviously most of you have never used a wireless controller before Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries put it this way you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days and that is not cool at all I will be buying the wire controlers from now on The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great but again let me stresss this issue it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller that you just put batteries in well at least you thought you did die and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight 
Might be good game couldn t get it to download completely My son 7 used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday It came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play We kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient We don t do much PC gaming but we have a fairly new Dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient If the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we wouldn t have wasted his time We have yet to receive credit for this item A HUGE HASSLE We ll stick to the PS2 games from now on 
just another RPG yawn how many RPG s can this world make they re all the same open this container take weapons and health kits from this dead body use this spell KOTOR is no different sadly the combat IMHO is just really boring when you see an enemy the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make if that doesn t kill the enemy your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves umm how many times has this been done before if i wanted that i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they re on now all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers it s the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack look it up the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it 
Beware the controls are terrible I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails What they didn t say was that it s almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller which is what you really need to do For anything but shooting all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour s play time I had to take a break to rest my aching joints In case you haven t seen it the G Con2 gun has a teeny weeny directional pad on the back of it and it s this that you are expected to use to move yourself around Now if you try holding the gun in a standard aiming style you ll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs And they don t sit still waiting to be shot So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time And guess what It s impossible Bravo Capcom Oh sorry they didn t stop there but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time And be able to pull the trigger But even that s the end of it if you want still more pain try using sniper mode As you may have realised the control scheme completely spoiled the gameplay for me I m not fumble handed by any means but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this Which is a shame because a free roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle which means you don t have to worry about movement at all hooray The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T Rex are probably the most fun in the game The rest is ruined by the controls which make your life hell I ll tell you something else too most levels have a TIME LIMIT In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero so if you don t rush through the stage it s game over for you Kind of negates the joy of free roaming doesn t it You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B killing everything that moves might as well be on rails I don t know why this stupid condition was added as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game It s a real waste of potential but it s only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release If you buy it you have only yourself to blame I managed to finish it the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonising hand cramps to get through Save yourself I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don t have to Could have been a great game but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun 
Horrible I really wanted to see how the developers could represent playing as a dragon and spyro is the only one that came to mind at the time I decided to get it I put it in my console turned it on and was blown away by the stupidity Basic Story Is stupid Bad dragon plant mean gems to kill good dragon Spyro good dragon defeat evil dragon Everybody dances because goodness prevailes Gameplay An atrocious story can be overlooked if the gameplay is good mario but spyro has probably the worst gameplay ever It combines horrible precise jumping puzzles with abysmally stupid enemies The puzzles require you to tap the jump button at a certain time If you don t you go back to the beginning of the puzzle It was maddeningly hard at some points and I am grown So how hard would it be for a kid For the enemies they should get the darwin award At many instances I was breathing flame it has a limited reach and the enemy walked right into it The enemies are dumber then a retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than Paris Hilton Also they are very weak dying in 1 2 hits There are also very few types of enemies like around 2 6 but they have the same AI and equally pose no challenge seeing as they are weak and attack you one at a time The boss battles are so simple they make you want to shoot yourself at how moronic they are Also playing as the other characters hunter blinx etc are not that fun In conclusion don t make the mistake I made and steer clear of this game Get better ones for yourself whomever you are giving a gift to Oh and don t listen to the other people who gave this crudhole good reviews they are either A Retarded or B Never played a decent game 
Spyro a heros tail i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one What happened this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game 
This game blows period Don t be fooled by the advertisments that you see in almost every magazine Blitz doens t offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible The greatest inconvience of the game is the load times They are WAY too long Loading up your profile is an inconvience loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save you start to think F ck this The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play Then there is the gameplay itself Bone crushing hits Please outside of the occasional dirty hit which is far easier for the computer to employ on you than vice versa the hits look like the early developments of Madden The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4th quater when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays conventionally treat him and he misses a quater Either way you ll never miss him This game is horrible from the graphics to the load times Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest 
A big disappointment This game was a really big disappointment for me I had to try this game because of all the hype and all the reviews here Having played the Nintendo 64 game titled Mario Kart 64 I felt like it was not much of an improvement In fact I feel that Mario Kart 64 was a better game The only improvement was in the graphics Still why do the characters not have fingers In this stage of the game you would think that they would have fingers by now Anyway after I played the game I played a bit cheated I was bored by it within ten minutes The game is supposed to shine with multiplayer but it fizzled There are so many GameCube racing games out there that are so much better than this game at a much lower price One example of a better combat racing game is Burnout If you can get any one of the games in this series you will see what a good combat racing game feels like I feel that Mario Kart Double Dash is a dumbed down version of Mario Kart 64 I so much wanted it to be a great game It no longer has the hopping ability of the previous game For me it just wasn t very good Double Dash probably would be better for very young gamers as they would probably be more forgiving of its shortcomings 
As entertaining as any of Squaresoft s films This game came highly recommended by people who generally have similar taste in games as me but I m still trying to figure out why There s no question that the in game graphics are impressive and the story line is interesting However the gameplay is nearly non existant and when you do happen to participate in some of the action the controls are either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated i e the sphere grid or blitzball Even the story is often poorly told with stilted voices and hilariously bad character animation If I had to compare this game to some of Squaresoft s other efforts it is similar to a mix between Final Fantasy 8 and Chrono Cross But while those two games were generally frowned upon by RPG enthusiasts Final Fantsy X has recieved almost universal praise In short I m not so much disappointed with the game as I am baffled by its warm reception 
Stressful to the MAX I bought this game on a whim having really liked Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 This game needs help First of all the frame rate is lower than it should be There is slow down as well Even the game before this Need For Speed Underground 2 looked 100 times better The car models in Most Wanted are a touch nicer looking and there is a far better selection than Underground 2 but that s the only plus this game has to it You don t race as much as fly around the city in a barely controlled frenzy trying to stay ahead of the computer cars Winning is more by luck than skill He or she who hits the least obstacles wins Hardly an enjoyable way to race I get too stressed when playing this game so I put it away for a while Definitely rent before buying this game 
Pretty disappointing Crashes delays and usability problems I started with Caesar2 back when it came out I played it for hours and hours and loved it When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed Things have changed I m spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes Without trading you make little money and the game is essentially over Other problems I m seeing is overall performance I don t have the fastest machine AMD 2 1ghz 512ram rockin video card with 256meg of mem but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes I find the whole game to be difficult to use This was not the case with Caesar3 Unless they issue a patch I m done feel frustrated with crashes Maybe I can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays My suggestion Wait for a patch before buying or move on jason 
if i could ever get it to work Well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades I couldn t get the video to work at all couldn t get technical support at all and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions 
Frustration abounds As others have said this was a much anticipated game I played Caesar II and III and was extremely excited when I heard that IV was coming out What a letdown I didn t have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned and I haven t had the game crash on me However the game is unplayable on my system which is only a year old unless I turn down 90 of the advanced graphics By unplayable I mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse and when the game responds Even with the graphics turned down I still get lag when the auto save starts As mouse control is essential when building roads or aquaducts this is aggravating in the extreme It appears that Sierra s programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics Too bad I can t see them The interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution This means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge I much prefer the tabbed building interface of the other city building games Although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game which you couldn t in earlier versions the interface is not smart enough to auto rotate the buildings to fit along the roads You have to click and drag to rotate buildings and lag even at the low graphics settings can make this an exercise in frustration I dislike the new warehouse management panel The sliders might look cool but they re slow lag I would ve liked to see additional options for only store basic goods only store luxury goods etc This would take some of the pain out of managing them Trade ports are different also you can t see prices It appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance In the one I m playing right now I m stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 50 required to win I have over 30 000 denarii in my treasury and have been turning a hefty profit and meeting various demands from Rome for at least eight years of game time I have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory but prosperity continues to elude me My city is almost completely automated by now the only thing I do is respond to Rome s requests for goods or cash My advisors have nothing helpful to say It s not fun if I can t advance So while the game is pretty from what I can see of it it s got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time 
Beautiful but flawed and no support First thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 Caesar games out there Having said that this game had a major bug right at the release How is that possible Is it unreasonable to expect a U S company to produce a flawless product Probably not but Tilted Mill has some of the the best pros in the industry Basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess The advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer Far better to go with CivCity 3 
Poor execution This one turned out badly and I hate to say I bought it Buggy worse than normal it is a rough game The fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible The support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions Too bad I trusted PC Gamer s review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers Do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game 
im to hott for yalll she is just right for me i know im a little to hot for her but i think wed make hollywoods cuttist couple 
Sid Say it ain t so Please Sid with the dissapointment of CivIV and now Railroads say you haven t jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers Sid the reason we purchase these games is because YOUR name is on them This game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who s grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games Please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards YOU created After this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account 
Disappointed This game is in such a sorry state that I don t even know where to begin First of all this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer Alas the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen Looks like Sid jumped in the easy fast and easy bandwagon Second the game is at best barely out of beta a little more useful and less destructive than say a computer virus I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks Finally be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen which interferes with other applications For instance the game won t launch while I run Skype Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer Shame on you Firaxis and Sid Meier 
The wait was not worth it I waited months for this game to come out I can t add anymore than what has been said by others I wonder how hands on Sid was with it Could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever 
Sid derailed bigtime on this release Sid Meier s reputation was unblemished after the Civil War series Civilization and the original releases of Railroad Tycoon But this game release is a major setback that will make me hesitate about any future products carrying his name This is a major derailment It is the fastest that I have ever firmly known that a new game was being removed from my hard drive Take a look at how many used copies are already flooding the market and this game just released less than two weeks ago Every aspect is made into chewing gum where you were used to having steak There is no expansion tweak or update that can fix how seriously dumbed down this version is 
Movie or game This so called game has a very good story and plot It keeps your attention by making you want to see what happens next However the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old Why you ask Because there is none You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need Oooooh there are multple endings Whoopee You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes This makes for a good movie but don t buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them 
on every system ok most people have more then one system i have a PS2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version or should i go for the free copy i can download for the PS2 some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don 
WTF Really some on tell me WTF Easy Boring Bugs bugs bugs glitches glitches glitches Question Is this a new game or possible bonus maps from CoD2 that they decided to make into a new game to profit more money Hmmmm The positive You can cook your grenades now I like mine medium rare Possibly useful in online matches as apposed to CoD2 where you couldn t and it was point less to throw a grenade in online matches because you knew where it was and could just move But I will never know because I thankfully rented the damn thing and didn t buy it Wait I didn t my dad did on a free rental from Blockbuster So they didn t get any of my hardly earned money Good for me Also could anyone tell me why I kept getting stuck on walls tanks people just about everything I think I was stuck in the air If you like this game you need to get the F k out and buy something else to play that I have so I can meet up with you and beat you Also if you don t like my run on sentences you can Yep you guess it Get the f k out 
What the hell Seriously I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet It was all I use to play online After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since Online play was non existent Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist It was ridiculus Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake This latest edition adds nothing to the series Do not purchase this game there are many better games out there 
Call of Duty 3 I had such high expectations for this game just to have them shot down The single player game is fine with some dumb things with the enemy AI The muliplayer is a joke Well first you have to get online which is basically impossiable The Multiplayer which was the best part of 2 is totally stupid and WORTHLESS in 3 One you can play by yourself Sounds like fun right two you have to drive the tank unless you are the second person to the tank but you cant just use the machine gun which u can in the other vehciles stupid Three there are some stupid errors in a bunch of levels where you can get stuck and have to respawn yourself i say rent it before you buy it 
Really disappointing My friends and I had high hopes for this game We played COD2 multiplayer every week and were excited about a new shooter After playing COD3 for a few rounds we decided to put 2 back in The graphics are great but we found a lot of bugs There were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance That s fine if you want to be a UN soldier but not if you re trying to sneak up on somebody Muzzle flashes were almost none existent No blood splash like in COD2 The single player game isn t too bad so far but if you plan on multiplayer I would recommend renting it first We were of the opinion that the game was rushed maybe they ll patch it 
does not work with S controller This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller Unless you still use the old monster sized XBox controller these cables are worthless 
You get what you pay for This game was originally released for 10 dollars Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2 
It is a tedious game that made me sick Tediously long and weary Nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW HL2 etc I am sick of this 
Horrible game Beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful Not to mention the monsters level up with you so you ll never be at an advantage You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 
Good for exploring very poor story I bought the game couple of weeks ago I was hesitating on buying it initially but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game I wish I didn t buy it To be fair I have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape cities and the level of details in the game I don t think I have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games I am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game For me landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story if there is any story from my perspective I have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th Oblivion gate I don t see any excitment in playing the game any further I explored most of the cities though quite quickly The conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with It was nice the first couple of times but then I am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out Honestly I would prefer playing Gothic1 on playing oblivion Just to tell you about the action excitment I am talking about I would like to say that when I got gothic2 I played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play 
Very Disappointed I bought this adaptor because my kids and I have both the Nintendo DS and DS Lite It works great on the original DS but the thing that s supposed to fit into the DS Lite is too wide If you re looking for an adaptor for just the regular DS this one works great If for the DS Lite don t waste your money 
So this is supposed to be realistic Really Wow So players in real football go through other players torso s They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs WR s change direction on one foot pivot glide and elude tackles Uh ok Anyone who plays this game on the All madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game What are the nerds at EA thinking Do they ENJOY making a game who s AI constantly cheats I love how they tout games that give the user more control when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game I don t control if I catch it or drop it or intercept it or if my line blocks of if my DB s cover their assignment none of it The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all drop easy picks drop easy catches etc And why oh why are DT s and LB s faster than my fastest WR Is THAT realistic The AI is terrible It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats Terrible game Just stop making these games if this is your final product 
Amazon Sucks I bought the piece of junk from Amazon and I regret the day I started using Amazon The machine did not work and the customer service of Amazon was the worst I have ever experienced I will never ever shop Amazon again 
AMAZON IS A FAKE NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN I don t even have to explain the worst bait and switch tatic I have ever seen HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AMAZON BAIT AND SWITCH I will never shop on AMAZON AGAIN 
Not a bad game but not a good game either I ll cut to the chase on this one If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII you will look over the shortcomings of this game and find some enjoyment out of it It has a good story and characters Its fun to see some of your favorite characters from VII return But if your not a FF fan then you won t have much motivation to play this game and I m not sure why you would like it Its very average to mediocre as a action game Its not horrible by any means but its just not very good either Honestly this game could have just been so much better in just about every aspect Gameplay wise there is nothing unique or interesting about it and I was just trying to blow through it too get to the next story part Its also pretty easy and not very challenging I can t really complain about the environments your fighting through tho they are well done and some are very well done in my book While the story is easily the strongest part of the game its not without faults either It s pacing isn t very good and some of it doesn t make a whole lot of sense either But it s kept alive by a strong cast of characters and some amazing FMV s in typical square fashion But the story could of been much better as well I m not complaining because it is good and gives you a good backstory of Vincent but it could of been better if it had been longer It just feels rushed and suffers because of that I finished the game at about 11 hours If it had been longer and closer to 20 hours they really could of done some special things with the story and developed the villians more Bottom line if your a FF fan you ll probably enjoy it 
Unfortunate Gaming As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for They gave us Advent Children cell phone games and finally Dirge of Cerberus This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man 
Lobs gallore 80YD TD passes everytime BORING I can t believe how many people are saying how realistic this game is That can not be further from the truth All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80 of the time regardless of coverage What fun is that This in itself is highly unrealistic Don t even get me started on the other things this game does NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game realism is thrown out the window in this one EA does not know the meaning of AI The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does Don t waste your money and don t make EA any more richer its obvious they just throw these games together They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank 
great game if you like BS plays and inconsistency I really tried to like this game being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition The graphics and sound are great in this game but its ruined by EA s cheating AI I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life No matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling even if you think you have them beat on a play your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass If you throw a high pass not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you even if you press the passing button your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack This game is total BS there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation When you are playing defense you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes Not the CPU receivers the CPU receivers regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time if they don t catch it the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion Think again you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation Not the CPU the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he s being hit What about the inconsistency you ask Well let me explain How is it that one game you can be totally on but the next game you can t even complete ONE pass I ll tell you why The CPU wants you to lose so you will drop every pass fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book I was playing a game and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD before my offense even touched the field Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU BS lobs BS runs and BS calls I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half Its not because the CPU was playing good defense its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them wide open or not I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game 1 for 20 I think At this point I knew I had no chance of winning so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win Yes you can win games as I have but it is so inconsistent If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose nothing you can do about it I see why EA bought the license after putting out crap like this they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI instead of this cheating crap I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good EA sucks and so does this game 
Fuhgettaboutit If you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do But it won t operate a DVR DVD VCR or cable box If you re really keen on it I ll sell you mine 
Junk No way to change the inputs on your TV The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a tv button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on off the TV or the XBox And if things couldn t get any dumber if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn t work The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode There is also no option to program a receiver As many others mentioned this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage 
Do not buy this please read Try before you buy This game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again Beware 
I Think It s Time We Move On People First let me say that I whole hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius Back in the glory days of Counter Strike 2001 2002 this game was the be all end all for 1 Online video games 2 First Person Shooters 3 PC Games and 4 Any video game basically It had real life weapons the graphics were superb at the time the maps were extremely well made the system requirements are still obscenely low and damnit it was fun Then inevitabely the hands of time began to take their ruthless indiscriminate toll Video cards supported better graphics new and yes better games came out Battlefield 1942 Unreal Tournament 2004 hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter Strike and a lot of the cool casual gamers grew up or moved on From 2000 to 2004 Counter Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance By 2004 to present day it has become a problem Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom s worn out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98 Counter Strike is still one of the most popular games of all time with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day because people just don t seem to have enough self control to give up their hopeless addiction Today server admins are for the most part humorless dictators and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game s undeniable monotonous drone People are still playing the same maps from the 1 0 release that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential It always feels as if I ve played the same round a thousand times before and I probably have Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way and all look disguisting I ve played on probably over 500 servers and downloaded probably over the same amount of quality custom maps and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation or voted on by the players Furthermore people are still playing the game using dial up and CS veterans are always complaining about camping even if its a tactic used to complete the objective As far as the objectives are concerned Counter Strike has basically become a deathmatch game No one will listen to anyone s plan on the rare occasion there is one no one tries to rescue the hostages and everyone always calls someone a p y or nub if you use the auto shotgun or AWP And to top it all off Valve cancelled the outstanding won net and replaced it with this Steam garbage a utility soaking wet with incompetence L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter Strike culture and has become its own incessant frustration But I won t even get into that If you re new to CS don t bother veterans of this game are far from friendly and you ll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you re a beginner For now if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game check out World of Warcraft Battlefield 1942 Sven Co Op or even Team Fortress Classic a dated game with an awesome community that has yet to lose its initial charm 
Extreamly Overrated and Overhyped I ll make this short and sweet for you I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this gem and see what all the fuss is about on this game OVERRATED I have no idea how people prais this as THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD How silly This game is just plain average If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve I don t need to tell you but I ll give you a hint H f L fe This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring And I don t need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours The good Visuals are good I guess Bad Very Mediocer Plain boring combat Nothing new Online isn t that great Extreamly Overrated TRUST ME Gets boring after awhile And yes I played this out for more then an 1hour 2 bucks I ll never get back 2 1 out of 5 stars Extreamly Overrated Not worth my 2 bucks and that s all I got to say Peac 
low memory and overpriced why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can These memory cards are way over priced I love PS2 It s one of the best systems I have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam I already own 2 cards and I need more 
The story is great as for the game Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII I ordered this game I loved that game and thought Say if Final Fantasy VII is this good then VIII must be even better boy was I wrong I m not bashing Final Fantasy VIII I kind of liked the game but there are big problems with it First of all the draw system is kind of hard but I liked it it was a change of pace but the way you have to equip summon GFs Guardian Force was hard and boring The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie AKIRA which is a bad thing The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops Not only that but the characters are not very likeable Main characters Squall A member of SeeD he is a jerk to everybody Zell A member of SeeD he is a surfer dude and a dunce Quistis A teacher and a member of SeeD she seems to like Squall for one reason or another Seifer Squall s rival he is even worse then Squall Rinoa A member of The owls Square soft ran out of ideas she is just like Aeris Selphie A member of SeeD she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts Laguna A Galbadian soldier He is the best charecter in the game Irvine A member of SeeD he is a lady s man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made The story is great but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP I would buy it but only if they removed the draw system 
Amazon Sucks I bought the piece of junk from Amazon and I regret the day I started using Amazon The machine did not work and the customer service of Amazon was the worst I have ever experienced I will never ever shop Amazon again 
NOT for MechWarrior fans If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series this ISN T it This is an extemely dumbed down version of MW Even if you Mechwarrior fans forget about having no customization remember this You can only fire one weapon at at time You have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets I was bored after about 5 minutes Again people who never played MW series may like this game better 
A sloppy emotionless title with few redeeming factors As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story The idea is that a secret off world clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map It seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightly colored shapes If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters I could go on because the game certainly doesn t stop there but I think you get the point I like to think that there s a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super detailed realism Generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because they re almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location Cartoons on the other hand generally don t worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time How much fun would the Wile E Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that s overly detail centric in an environment that s right out of a kid s show The result is a tale that comes off as way WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer s imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic There s a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and it s up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world That s it no side stories no reasoning no subplots just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B And here I thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an ages old cliche Now I don t want it to sound like I m railing on this game just because it s got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor It s also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself You don t hate the pig on the spaceship because he s trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because she s never mentioned between the game s start and its finish I mean the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight I don t honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging The first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools Shortly thereafter you re thrown to the wolves For the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether it s retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk har har above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point You ll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick I just can t overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is If there s a bottomless pit nearby and chances are very good that there is Blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what you re hitting on the control pad If there s an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button he ll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threat That s not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings The ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc All the while Blinx is moving around in real time It s a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized Why can t I use two controls at the same time Why don t more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers Why doesn t the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when I use my time powers Why is their duration so brief and why can t I hold more than a dozen uses at a time I mean this could ve really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run of the mill platformer The controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls He has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks He routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether you ve instructed him to do so or not He ll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasm I think it s these controls that most make Blinx so mind squashingly aggravating At a glance you d imagine they d be fairly difficult to screw up You ve got a jump button a suction fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement Plus there had already been a long established line of three dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title s release paving the way to an ideal control experience Super Mario 64 had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre s jump to the world of 3D It s like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway I can t even say I m impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper either With the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than you d imagine especially in contrast with Blinx himself Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury Here s a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and he s pitted against a set of monsters that could ve sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four year old s sketchbook Despite featuring a spoken dialog track there s no English voice acting I couldn t pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think it s either French or some close variation of it It certainly didn t sound Japanese While this does add a touch of personality to the title and it s not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television Everyone s vocal personalities are so black and white too that I feel like a great chance to establish some much needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here The bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and high pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball It s like a parody of the games that had come before but I won t give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose Overall Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a far below average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public At the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality On top of that I really don t know which audience they were targeting with it The game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kid friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can t imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx reaching near Marvel vs Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight The game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super tough later levels though you ll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process and enjoy self mutilation I d recommend you stay far away 
the worst game ever I hate this game its the worst game I ve ever played 
disappointing I was so excited to see this game come out I loved the Godfather and From Russia with Love and the hype surrounding this game was incredible The actual game however was incredibly disappointing The driving controls especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather are AWFUL I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to Most of the missions involve driving under a specific time limit and with these awful controls I gave up early way too frustrating The musical play list that you get to control was fun but I would have liked more free roaming like in the Godfather I was also looking forward to hearing everyone s voices that were in the opening credits Dale Earnhardt Jr But since I have almost totally given up on it now I guess I won t get to hear their voice acting talent Does anyone know if they plan to re release this on the xbox 360 Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to 
Why Tony Why Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie From Russia With Love which is actually not a bad game Recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this I simply couldn t resist picking up SCARFACE THE WORLD IS YOURS I loved the movie SCAR FACE and I was gonna love this But It turns out I didn t The controls are really a joke instead of your normal FPS 3PS RPG etcetera there are really bland controls you can t even tell what to do The dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke For die hard fans only I guess 
Very dull This game has a good concept nice graphics and some definitely funny moments but the gameplay is a total bore There are two main gameplay styles investigation and trial Investigation is the worst it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room talking to everyone and a ton of pointless reading much like an old point and click adventure on PC The court sections are a little better but not much Once again it s very linear you don t have to use your brain much just try all the options And once again there is a huge amount of reading There is way too much dialogue packed into the game and not near enough actual gameplay And most of the talking is aimless too very little of it actually advances the plot Overall this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text 
Never Received Thanks Amazon My nephew really needed a new controller So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday The game was received fine but he never received the controller I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon So the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation Who knows the controller could have been wonderful 
Buyer s Dual Shock The Playstation controller is nice However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy maybe even more so The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit This controller feels great with the thumb pads thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement Suddenly in 2005 four years after the PS2 was released games like Metal Gear Solid III Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini games feature The controller has been given new life because of this The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality This controller for all its design will give you a dual shock First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1 L2 or R1 R2 wing buttons Even if you don t drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink I have never seen one that managed to remain straight Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don t need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time Make these controllers more robust please The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly 
Overpriced and Not Very Worth It You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims the Stuff Pack is not very worth it Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny 
Where are the items I noticed there were not many new items in this game I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving This expansion ws not worth the money 
It s nice but Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss I have had many collections I ve downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable So I was looking forward to a Stuff pack from Maxis Bah Yes there are several very nice items but really this is an underwhelming collection on the whole Items are very limited and the collections are small The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained Like so many here remarked the money spent is not equal to the value received Another reviewer pointed out what the title Glamour Life implies jewelry house items luxurious textures for floors and walls and clothing for all ages and most of all excess and abundance There s no abundance here I ve found items I like but I am not impressed with the collection Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items and I think it is taking advantage of the fact fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money I feel a little cheated If you must have this wait until the price drops or better yet find a good reputable fan site there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads and download for a small fee or for free 
Where s the glamour This pack offered very little of anything The decor very little of it is uninspired I was hoping to get some good artwork at least I know a lot of people don t like to download from fan sites but don t waste your money on this junk Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy 
Rented it 1 star for looking at the game cover in the store 2 stars for the visual and audio and playinggggg Walk pick up specified items push things use a few gadgets Those save points that are maddening rather than save as you go Things to do over for the another character Same collection of villans over and over The cut scenes are sketched for you and the narration is on and on why do the houses look so similar Stuff in the houses that you can not touch boring Find Things you need but can not use yet and have to go back for it Not so puzzle solve as much as fetch this and that No free range chicken doors are often locked Had to catch same snakes more than 3 times weeee Atleast if you fail a task you get to try again REMEMBER nothing goes well from the get go I found no cheats online for this game as of yet Dont play the piano you hit buttons when they float by on screen The kids are cute and each special gadget and moves such as they are I have Never read these books but there is a Warning at the start of the game that this is depressing and states nothing comes out right for these kids If you want to try this game rent it If you want to buy this game for someone make sure you dont mind making yourself depressed for spending the cash and them for playing it Do you play the game or does it play you 
My Review I bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage 
Over rated When I first played this game I got bored in 10 minutes All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them Bring girls into your car and do it with them I dont recommend this game at all its overrated 
USC Texas 2005 OK so where the heck is Vince Young Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush in this version You see Reggie Bush on the cover so you think you re going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl But none of these players are to be found In fact Ohio State is listed as the 1 team Am I behind the times Or is this how EA Sports does their football games Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime I was hoping to be able to play them with updated abilities that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005 Any ideas out there Is this a code or a cheat I need to unlock HELP 
50 Not worth it IT S THE SAME GAME AS 05 AND 06 I was reading that 8000 word review by Dave Jeanclerc and I strongly disagree with some of his points P S My review has nothing to do with the XBox 360 version which apparently is awesome I HAVE PLAYING THE EA FOOTBALL GAMES SINCE THE MID 90 S and I m sick of paying 50 for the same game every year EA Games owns the rights to the college and NFL teams so you won t see any football games by any other game companies most noteably SEGA who revolutionized football simulation games in the late 80 s NCAA Football 07 is basically the same as NCAA Football 2002 and 2003 and 2004 and 05 and 06 Each year EA adds a little tweak to the mix but overall it s the same look the same feel the same moves the same everything This year they ve changed the way you kick the ball and added more defensive audibles that s it There are a few other minor adjustments but none are worth noting IMO In fact the audibles they added are the EXACT SAME audibles you used to have on Sega s ESPN Football 2005 you can call audibles for individual defensive players Thieves Everything else is THE EXACT SAME AS 05 and 06 The most disappointing thing graphically speaking is the crowd it still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison just like it did on games made 10 years ago OH one other big change the improved momentum meter If you thought it was ridiculous last year wait til you play NCAA 07 The momentum meter has such a strong influence on the game that if you make ONE OFFENSIVE MISTAKE in the beginning of the game you re doomed that s it You can t win For example I played FSU vs UM twice The first time I made no 1st half errors and pounded the Hurricanes 31 10 I played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff giving the Hurricanes the ball at my 35 yd line and I lost the game 45 24 That fumble was my ONLY MISTAKE of the game NESSLER HERBSTRIET AND CORSO ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME EXACT IN GAME COMMENTS THEY WERE SAYING IN 05 AND 06 GIMME A BREAK Also the AI is still atrocious Defensively the computer controlled team is hapless They blitz on every down In fact I ve lined up numerous times for a 3rd and long with 4 or 5 receivers and the defense continually loads 8 men in the box they don t even put enough DB s out there to stop me It s basically a game of long bombs If you choose a team with good receivers you can easily throw for 400+ yards a game by continually going deep THE SAFETIES ALWAYS BLITZ The safeties only drop back into coverage if you have 3rd and 20+ or 4th and 15+ So how does the computer couteract your deep balls Easy when the momentum meter swings against your favor your receivers drop EVERY BALL YOU THROW AT THEM even if you hit them in the chest with the ball and when you finally decide to run the ball your RUNNING BACK FUMBLES THE BALL IMMEDIATELY I played a game between USC and Cal and I kept switching to play with the team that DIDN T have the momentum and I ended up turning the ball over on every possession You may be reading this and saying Hey this guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out No not really it s exactly how I ve played the 05 and 06 game and the same glitches I ve encountered in them too EA has really dropped the ball again You are paying 50 to get updated rosters and in typical EA fashion you don t even have names for any of the players just different skill levels EA games suck Their soccer games are horrible their basketball games are too slow and awkward and they don t update their football games I GUARANTEE YOU THAT MADDEN 07 WILL BE THE SAME AS MADDEN 06 JUST WATCH And by the way EA has gone all out on the XBox 360 editions of NCAA 07 ans Madden 07 I m sure those versions will be stunning The rest of us are paying the same price for last year s game 
Garbage Typical Xbox game using checkpoints instead of creativity to make it challenging Nothing more mind numbing than doing the same thing over and over again because you keep getting killed right before the next checkpoint Granted you can get hours and hours of playing time from it but only about 25 is something that you haven t already done 10 times before I highly recommend this game to people who are of the intellect that enjoy working on production lines where they do same thing repeatedly If your brain actually requires some kind of stimulation find a more creative game In addition some actions tend to be a bit uncooperative at times such as when attempting to knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting to get shot Apparently if you aren t facing in just the perfect position when attempting smash his brains out you stand there like a manakin hoping the guy two inches in front of you doesn t notice Another option is to try and shoot him but unless you get a head shot expect to fire of gobs of rounds to take him out since you seem to be armed with what can only be a 22 short pistol 
this game sucks nothing more really needs to be said I m running a 3GHz P4 256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer I tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect DO NOT BUY THIS GAM 
Repetitive boring The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush Assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy s platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI Since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building s aspect Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay Unlike the previous version of B W there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features Cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of Age of Empires 
Not great The game itself is very interesting the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique It s an RPG which is quite a switch for Mario The major problem with this game is interactivity not enough of it Specifically there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable Many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle it takes about 10 minutes to get to the real fight from the prior save point This isn t a problem for the first time through the sequence but if you lose 4 or 5 times this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end This is a major problem that most game designers have found work arounds for but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element It s an interesting game but just make sure to win or have a friend sibling enemy skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them 
Not for Everyone All I have to say is this game is not for EVERYONE you have to be able to READ to play Last time I checked not everyone can read I bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum He can master just about every game I get him but he can t read So for him this game was not much fun I ended up playing more than he did and I didn t even enjoy it 
Not Gonna Cut It with games such as Grand theft auto San Andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this won t cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at EB games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play GTA or true crime instea 
Should have been alot better I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad The story line was basically typical it really didn t hold my interest for long I did beat the game because I spent 50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did It s worth renting but definately not worth buying Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls 
sucks sucks this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you like I said just a waste of time plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead and they said it took then a long time to make this game this game should have never been release 
sucks sucks this game is really bad I mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam 
Downgraded physics as in GT 3 Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult made worse by poor car physics Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars while light cars easily derail your heavy car Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal and that s with sports tires Long gone are the ESPN like replays of GT 2 For some reason cars look thinner than before The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen The 3D mechanics can be headache prone made worse by the poor physics of the cars Easily the most inadequate music ever The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes which is nothing new However it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track The game has mostly only newer models almost none from a few years ago unlike in GT 2 The only good thing about this game is that you don t have to drive all the time The B Spec driving mode can win races for you Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen This can help in skipping the painful early parts of the game The powertrain is still not modifiable Compression bore stroke camshaft timing overlap valve size and other engine characteristics are still not available With poor driving physics engine modification would not have helped this game Loading times are very long with the most annoying loading indicator ever Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens This game is a yet another disappointment much like GT 3 was The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like you will have to drive them for real The Gran Tourismo series are over unlikely to return to what they used to be I m not a racing game fan but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy If you want good car make independent physics you need to play Gran Tourismo 2 
Fair Warning Rent it before you buy Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid I was looking forward to playing this The graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot VR quot points becomes annoying after awhile The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that s with playing with a PS2 gun I can t imagine shooting with a controller which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot VR quot points The dialog gets annoying too and you can t skip hearing it either 
HORRIBLE CLIPPING ISSUES This game has a great design and excellent fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn t respond quickly to the commands The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat This CAN be a fun game just don t play the PC version Borrow someone s Xbox and play that version This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right 
I beat this game in a matter of a few hours I thougt there would be a better story line and what I found was very disappointing The boss McGruder was easier to beat than the boss in the Matrix Path to neo I mean I paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously I was wrong 
Beware of this controller I plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver The receiver light kept blinking which means that it didn t recognize the controller After several tries I decided that the product is defective and returned it 
not for pc this just sucks the main person just keeps running around He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he won t peddle but gos backwards quite well Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked Atleast I bought it used and for not much money Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later 
Not likeable by 3 year old I rented this game for my 3 year old Who loves the movie He tried to play it He like it I tried to play it got to the dancing part I couldn t get past it I tried for 5 days My rental time was up I returned it I haven t rented it since This game is way too hard to beat And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast I would NOT recommend this game to anyone Don t waste your money buying it Unless you are an expert with video games I m just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it 
Dancing almost impssible I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn t get past it don t waste your time or patience with this annoying game 
Very buggy and incomplete Pointless quests with no real conclusions CTD every 30 45 minutes Lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment All in all a VERY unpolished product even with the patch If your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game 
EEEKS Point and Click Yawn Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG Shooters BUT I cant believe this is a point and click game I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill The days of Boulder s Gate point n click should be over but I guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay Still a good game but dissapointed 
disgraceful lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why the first was very good 
TERRIBLE GAME I BOUGHT THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS 50 BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAME I WAS WRONG YOU DONT GET A LIGHTSABRE UNTIL FAR INTO THE GAME AND ALL THE ADVERTISMENTS SHOWS YOU WITH A LIGHTSABRE THE GAME IS EXTREMELY BUGGY AND HAS POOR GRAPHICS I AM A HUGE STARWARS FAN AND WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A STARWARS FAN THEY ARE DONT BUY THIS GAME 
Not the best First off i just want to say that i ve read The Secret of the Old Clock and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it which i can understand But I m 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring The puzzles were way too easy and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people i didnt get anything Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste 19 00 on it I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games 
strictly for kids only i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here s an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children s word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i couldn t progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i didn t want to i m not saying it s a bad game it s just probably not a good game for grownups 
Boring and Tedious Sure the graphics and sound ARE nice but this game is very linear and very forgiving too forgiving You can save and reload just about constantly so long as there aren t monsters nearby and things are made kinda dummy proof so you can t make any significant mistakes As a result I never really felt like I was taking much of a chance doing anything The dialogue is mostly a matter of clicking responses until you can t click anymore and there s not much bad consequence to clicking them in any ol order There s really only one path through the different areas of the game and nothing ever respawns You can also adjust the difficulty levels from very easy to very difficult but the experience and treasure don t adjust accordingly This means if a fight is too tough after a couple reloads you can make it very easy and still get the same rewards you would have gotten when it was hard lt yawn gt Maybe I m just a little jaded from playing online games like Everquest for so long In online realtime games with other humans playing around you there is much more of an unpredictable and more importantly uncontrolable and much more exciting environment to play in I got so bored with this that I actually stopped playing while close to completing the very last area of the game I just didn t care anymore This game requires very little thinking or strategizing 
A great concept gets ruined On paper the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea and upon first glance of it it seems like it s firing on all cylinders Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles Kiefer Sutherland Dennis Haysbert Elisa Cuthbert etc and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show 24 The Game falls apart once you get further into it The missions are repetitive the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched and the controls are unresponsive to say the least Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you Some of this could be forgiveable but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels It s a shame too considering how innovative the series was in it s early life and everything the game had going for it If more polish was put into it 24 The Game could have been something special but as it is it s only recommended as a rental for fans of the series 
This game is pretty pour I guess the first thing i ll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game I was HUGELY dissaponted I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought There are way to many puzzles I don t mind puzzles but there are simply way to many And some on them are insainly hard I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight Jedi Academy way better the puzzles aren t insain and you get to choose what you look like and well I could go on but i ll leave it there If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is 20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game Just don t get this game 
Pretty Useless I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller you must use the remote control When you take the dongle out with a DVD in a screen will come up telling to reinsert so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction then you ve just wasted thirty bucks I feel quite ripped off With the low cost of DVDs nowadays it s a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO you can get a good progressive scan for about 30 or 40 which comes out to about the same price As a side it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can t turn on or off the device with the remote you must go up to box to do it yourself especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives 
DVDs don t play DVD s which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or don t play when I try to play them on the XBOX Don t waste your money on this buy a stand alone DVD player instead so you won t have the frustration that I ve had 
DON T buy this This remote is of awful quality i ve been through two of them in the past year I wouldn t complain so much if it didn t cost 30 It s worth ten at most Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player rather than using the xbox 
A Disappointment I love the Nancy Drew games and I own every one I bought this game with high hopes then I finished it in only one day It was that simple Yes like all Nancy Drew games there were interesting characters amazing graphics and intriguing puzzles but those good things failed to even out the bad The game was over much too quickly The problem of the game was too simple and seemingly unimportant There was not much to do and the three or so mandatory tasks were monotonous and dull While the character switch Her Interactive offered was interesting it could also be very confusing The characters though interesting were not as thoroughly developed as in the other Nancy Drew games And what I consider the worst fault of all the ending of the game was absolutely horrid It was by far the worst of all the games in its series There was no action or chase or anything that really needed a brain or quick thinking It was just over While the Nancy Drew games are an amazing series as a whole this game just left me wondering What was Her Interactive thinking I would recommend this game only to the die hard Nancy Drew fans To those of you merely seeking a fun and entertaining game look at some of the other Nancy Drew games I believe that The Curse of Blackmoor Manor The Secret of Shadow Ranch and The Secret of the Scarlet Hand are the best 
so so The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game My daughter has played them all However after a while it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery However this game took her two days All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed In fact her words at the end of the game were that s it Her interactive better come out with a more interesting game next time or you ll lose the interest 
Disapointing for a Nancy Drew game Seems like they just huried this game Too much running around to get answers The phone did not even have web acsess Actually i did not like it at all 
Disappointed My daughter and I have played all of the previous games we ve enjoyed them overall Some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun This game was quite lame in comparison to the others The puzzles weren t really puzzling just boring tasks There were not many clues to find Because there weren t many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything The game ended abruptly and was very short We did NOT use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally The rest was pretty boring If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game try one of the others instead 
Way too short and repetitive The review by Bovey is spot on These games have gotten more boring as they go The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough There was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom And the game was so short suddenly it ended I am so disappointed in what these games have become I loved The Final Scene I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough This game was just lame I don t recommend paying full price for it 
Very Disappointing I ve been a fan of these games since the first one Secrets Can Kill came out I ve played them all I m not at all sure what s happened to the games though While the graphics have steadily improved the puzzles plot and gameplay have really gone downhill The first game Secrets Can Kill had pretty horrific graphics but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it Things really picked up with the second game Stay Tuned for Danger Better graphics and a very interesting story very cool puzzles great plot I can absolutely recommend Games 2 Stay Tuned for Danger 3 Message in a Haunted Mansion 4 Treasure in the Royal Tower 5 The Final Scene 6 Secret of the Scarlet Hand 7 Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake 9 Danger on Deception Island and 10 Secret of Shadow Ranch These games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles Lots of areas where you can snoop around which I really enjoy Game 8 The Haunted Carousel is interesting and has wonderful graphics but is awfully short I did not at all enjoy 11 Curse of Blackmoor Manor as I found it way too difficult I also cannot really recommend 12 Secret of the Old Clock It was too short and repetitive I did somewhat enjoy 13 Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and 14 Danger by Design but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles And now we have 15 Outstanding graphics but way too short The amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy I don t mind Nancy running about doing errands to help people for that I thought Games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced But I like each task to be different and interesting Not mind numbingly repetitive and boring This seems to be a factor of the more recent games delivering telegrams in Game 12 painting pictures in Game 14 and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game I miss looking for clues Putting together evidence for a purpose I miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game It seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took X number of hours to complete I also miss learning useful things In 1 I learned about American Sign Language In 3 I learned about Chinese symbols and the San Francisco earthquake In 4 I learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant works In 6 I learned SO much about the Maya and how to work a HAM radio In 7 I learned about Roman Numerals and Prohibition In 8 I learned how to make invisible writing In 9 I learned how to work a HAM radio and about Pacific Northwest sea animals After that well I didn t really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games If you ve never played a Nancy Drew game please please PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games although probably not the very first one the graphics aren t as good and switching discs can be highly annoying But give 2 9 a try you won t be disappointed Oh please Her Interactive PLEASE go back to the way they used to be structured I d gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot cohesion or integrated interesting puzzles 
Square Enix I expected more from you this game has a 25 minute introduction or story Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good However I do expect them to put something like Skip Intro cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories I however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that This is only a minor flaw Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears Very annoying but again a minor flaw This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again It get very boring after awhile You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle 1 0 3 5 terrible 3 6 5 bad 5 1 6 5 average 6 6 8 good 8 1 9 great 9 1 10 must buy excellent graphics 9 10 great sound 9 10 some voice acting but great fun 5 10 depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over again average about 8 my grade 7 goo 
Is this a game or a just a really boring story I had read pretty good reviews about this game so I bought it I was hoping for something with a little action with an interesting storyline What I got was probably the most boring game I have ever played The introduction prolouge lasts about 7 minutes or so including the credits You cannot break out and move on After you set down your PSP and grab a drink you come back and find that there is one short battle for you to play Then you go back to the story The characters have long annoying conversations and you get to press X at the end of each of their sentances Again no way to break out no in game menu for you to manage the game You have to go through each painfully slow dialog box until the chapter is over This game is really bad Maybe it gets a little more interesting it is possible that there is actually something for you to do besides watch the characters argue It is really slow and it is all about the storyline and the dialog There does not appear to be any freeplay If you have played this type of game before and you enjoy that style of play then you might like it I was bored and frustrated from the first minute 
AAAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHHHHH Pretty much sums up how I felt after 15 minutes of introductory waffle hellishly annoying bingy bongy music and admittedly very pretty cut scenes totally emotionless voice overs impossibly slow conversations that served little or no point And to be honest at that point it was either switch off the psp or throw it against a wall I decided to switch it off Now I m a big fan of adventure games played untold legends 1 till it gave up on me literally left hanging around with nothing to do and no more quests on offer From what I can gather the in game graphics for Valkyrie after 15 minutes though it seemed like much longer I d seen some really cool character graphics bit like tekken DR in game graphics and some of those horrible 2d munchkin japanese rpg graphics which are the in game stuff So the bit you play looks like it s 20 years old and should be on a gba the cutscenes are nice but there will no doubt be far too many of those ie 5 minutes of slow cut scenes for every encounter I can t say this is a proper review as I couldn t stand this title long enough to get to any actual gameplay and there s no way I m sitting through that intro again My advice if you like the long winded old style walk and talk for three hours before actually doing anything japanese rpgs Get this or better still go to an antiques shop and find an old text adventure If you prefer a game where you actually play the character and do stuff avoid this like the plague I ve got high hopes for dungeon siege when it comes out but then I had high hopes for valkyrie too but for now untold legends 2 is okay not as good as it should have been but a helluva lot more fun than valkyrie I would like to point out that I ve never played on a ps2 xbox or game cube so this is the first time I ve seen a valkyrie profile game I didn t have any preconceptions obviously if I had I d never have gone anywhere near this title in the first place 
This Game Is Frustrating I love the idea behind this game and it s pretty impressively exectuted I had three gripes though 1 It s so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 I couldn t get the magnify and reduce with quick little circles to work This caused me great frustration 3 There s no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times I quit playing it pretty quickly 
Trauma Center DS will cause you to go to the ER This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do As the patients vital signs drops you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do The nurse who assists you gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you ve failed the mission It would take me an average of 10 15 failures before I finally won a mission The last mission I played that made me quit resulted in 30+ failures And that s only being 1 hour and half into the game The graphics are crisp and clear The storyline didn t make much of an impression on me But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients game collector who will keep it sealed or you re a gultton for punishment Whatever you do do not buy this game for the hype It does not live up to it 
Do not buy Pelican screen protectors or styluses for the NDS I know that Pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they re always the cheapest ones available That should tell you something First of all the top screen uses adhesive It s smooth plastic in the middle but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen Because the edge is a different material than the middle it s insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it and being adhesive trying again and again isn t much of an option Furthermore the sticky edge is white not clear and it looks horrible on my onyx DS Lite After having so much difficulty with the top screen protector I checked online for reviews I read several reports of people who used the Pelican styluses with the Pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour s worth of use So whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus the combination just doesn t work Many people report simply throwing their Pelican Write and Protect sets into the trash so I m not the only one that paid Pelican money for something that s going into the trash can No matter how inexpensive Pelican s product is it s still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too I know I m going to avoid the Pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future and I very much wish that there were reviews here on Amazon before I bought mine I had to dig through Nintendo DS forums to read other peoples opinions Finally if you already bought one and hate it you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue 
I thought as a non gaming female I might like this game To me this game was seriously disappointing So disappointing I didn t finish the second case before setting it down forever I was highly entertained at first It s cute funny and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining However it quickly got older 1 You can t skip through the horrendously long dialog ever Even after you ve heard it about a million times because you re clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do 2 I found myself looking for an internet walk through yes on this simplistic game I couldn t figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you ve read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level 3 Possible Spolier There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium After that I just couldn t take it any more and gave up 4 The places and people never change For each case from my understanding it s all the exact same tiny few places I m not a big gamer but I like a world bigger than three feet I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me Just to help this review I m a college age female and this is my first gaming console although I ve played the PS2 quite a bit Maybe it s really a hit or miss but I don t really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level A REALLY high patience level 
A Weak Nintendo System This GameCube is WEAK I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems Nintendo s recent system the GameCube has several problems with it s design First of all the internal fan is slow but quiet After an hour or so of use the system overheats thus shuts down Second problem the wireless controllers for this system SUCK We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week The brands we have tried Pelican Intec Nintendo and Osmart The third problem is that the system was not built to last I still have the NES and Nintendo 64 which both work great I doubt the GameCube will last past 4 5 years of use Simply put DON T BUY THIS PRODUCT ALSO The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon From the description and from the specs you will need to stand up and interact move around and stuff with the game Sounds fun but would you like to do that after a hard day of work It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy 
Great overall but it needs work This game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people 
Hate It This is Supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc A shoddy product 
Very boring quite playing after 2 days I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs and lamely fighting rats The interface is terrible You are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you can t even carry your treasure back to town This game was all work with no fun Do not buy 
beware there are pros and cons of this card PROS its stores a lot of memory able to save many files at one time compact affordable CONS games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car 
A Pretty Good Device for the Casual Gamecube Owner Make no mistake this is the memory card for you if you ve got a Gamecube which I m assuming you do or you re planning on getting one soon Anyway there are 251 blocks on this baby which may not seem like a lot but it is It gets the job done and you don t have to worry about it corrupting data or anything I ve had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there It s also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button Please don t get that damn third party memory card from Madcatz my experience with that is corrupted data and constant reformating of the card which erases your files anyway Only go with Nintendo they re the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card I must say though this is for the casual gamer Someone who doesn t have every game they can possibly get a hold of Some EA games for exammple take up over one hundred blocks of memory Basically what I m saying is simple If you re one who has a ton of games you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it Not every game has a save for just the game Resident Evil for example saves on a different block every time Just like a playstation memory card If you re like me however you probably don t have THAT many games that it s a bother The other thing I must caution is simple This thing like every other memory card is small as hell This one even more so If you can keep it plugged in your Gamecube at all times The great thing about memory cards just about everyone of them is simple You can take them anywhere Does your same friend also own Super Mario Sunshine Hey that s great now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card It lightens the load It s essential to have a memory card if you buy a Gamecube and this is a good one If however you happen to be someone who has a TON of games this won t hold you over long enough and you ll have to buy another No Gamecube owner should be without a memory card though 
Ehh I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun Well it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it I d only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily 
Imperfect is right Remember all those countless super hero licensed beat em up s that plagued 16 bit systems At first glance EA s Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects might not seem like that type of game but make no mistake that it is a repetitive and quickly boring beat em up with a host of technical issues You can play as a variety of Marvel Comics heroes and villains as well as six Imperfects cyborg esque warriors created specifically for the game The single player mode is ungodly repetitive as you battle hordes of generically created enemies This gets boring real quick with button mashing galore and repetitive gameplay The destructable environments seem like a good plus at first but you ll soon learn how much they actually work against you in a brawl and it becomes more frustrating than it should be The cumbersome control scheme adds to this not to mention that the controls can get to be quite buggy as well The graphics look sharp from a distance but the game has an odd look to it like it doesn t know if it wants to look like Spider Man 2 or Ultimate Spider Man both are great games that are much more worth your time than this and the in game cut scenes look godawful There are a few saving graces which save Marvel Nemesis from being a complete clunker including a horde of unlockable content that comic fans will love The Marvel heroes super powers are nicely pulled off including Storm s weather attacks and Daredevil s agility and the online support is where the most fun from the game is to be had Other than that though there s not much else here to hold your interest If you re looking for a great super hero game check out the X Men Legends series or the aforementioned Ultimate Spider Man If you re looking for a great beat em up check out Rockstar s the Warriors all of which are more worthwhile than this 
Nancy s Train Ride was Short Lived This review is in reference to Nancy Drew Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide edition I ve played 3 or 4 of the Drew games This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game Before I had installed Blue Moon Canyon I had installed Morrowind the Game of the Year Edition which sold for five dollars less than Blue Moon Canyon Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has at the bare minimum 400 hours of gameplay and possibly might literally be endless The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15 20 minutes After I had installed and played Blue Moon Canyon we installed and got up and running Age of Mythology Gold also within 20 minutes This is another massive game a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack The Titans Both Mythology games were completely installed This is another game that can be played and explored for years The two game set sold for five dollars more than Blue Moon Canyon or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon took so long to download we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone We have a P4 at 3 2Ghz an 80GB HD of which only 23GB were used and 1 5 GB of RAM There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long over an hour to download unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super Multi Drive drivers The actual installation was not as painful as the download What was painful was the gameplay I had a lot of fun playing the Secret of the Old Clock Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game I liked playing the golf game and the car chase and the bank shots of reflective light beams to be aligned I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed I knew that the Drew games wouldn t deliver the value that the two games mentioned above did But after the reading the reviews of Blue Moon I expected to have more fun than I did with Secret even though I knew it would be short lived What a let down The game was over in two or three hours Most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over or which way the track leaned to The arcade games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case click the mouse You didn t even have to look The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing It was very boring Between the price the concern over the length of the download the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train I cannot recommend this game as being fun It had a few moments with the Math scale problems but it wasn t enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to I realize I m an adult but the eight year old little girl I bought it for lost interest after the first 15 minutes She was wiser than I Sorry Nance this one is a waste of money and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts marf 
clue chronicles i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i 
Hasbro Clueless on Cusotmer Service We recommend not buying this game unless you don t mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can t be fixed Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available Save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free 
Save your money I bought this game about a week ago I had not purchased the prequil sp to this game and did not know what to expect I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30 45 minutes later I have no played the game since Here s why The graphics to me are ridiculously annoying It makes the game feel so unrealistic The graphics are a step lower than NBA Street and even more unrealistic The real problem is that there is just nothing to do You enter tournements and they all feel the same The little side missions are laughable and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them I can go on and on about why I hated this game But I won t The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game but don t let that happen to you 
Do Not Purchase After playing this game for the third time I had a thought WHY DID I BUY THIS This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street s Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game 
Incredribly uneven First off I cannot believe how mad this game has made me I like all kinds of games but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped It s one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do what to do etc even after I killed all the bad guys I didn t know how to get out of the room This game is not intuitive sp at all Secondly this game should not be called the Incredibles it should be called Mr Incredible because you play as him almost all the time Playing as Elasta Girl is great I really enjoyed that part but when there are a lot of baddies with guns Mr Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload I liked the first mission as Dash when you play as Dash which is only twice you have to run fast however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn t see what was ahead of me Playing a Violet was bad they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission The Incredi ball mission Incredibi sucked it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place I m just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven t enjoyed a lot of it which is a shame because I really loved the movie Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr Incredible needs to do more than punch people Currently I m on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more Bottom line Playing as Elasta girl was fun everything else was either blah or made me want to swear a lot Hopefully the second game will be better I ll be renting that instead of buying this game left me disappointed overall 
No one will be super Shouldn t you people know by now Say it with me NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible It was way too easy to die in etc etc etc Hey listen Keep you money Your investment isn t in here 
PS 2 slim slimmer why the vertical stand is wonderfull but why you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape I put my PS slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product I bought it just for kicks literally 
kings quest poor quality out of box you can only play KQ7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is 
Lies My gripe is about KQ6 One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions This information is false At the time of its origional release I was fortunate to have a high end computer for its time that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 maybe 98 Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset 
Great Game BAD EDITION I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop OOPS they didn t update any of the drivers for the first two games Kings Quest 1 2 so after about 15 minutes of playing you can t see the screen due to all of the graphic errors There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn t look like any are on the way I feel pretty ripped off It says on the cover in big print Runs on Windows XP Barely and not very well when it does If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed Better yet download one of the fan made editions for free online They work 
Too much hype nothing interesting delivered After all the Hype about this game I bought it well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over The costumes and decals are kinda stupid Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND well is NOT and not even close The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics sound game play and fun dont get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either check out some reviews out there before you buy it 
Extremely disappointing This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part regardless of what anyone says I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non intuitive battle system Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy including the very first one Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets The game has very few items weapons or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies which are stronger than expected The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy Battles with main enemies are long which isn t such a problem However they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle just to frustratingly finish off a battle weakened party Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying I don t remember any music from this game so plain it is Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga Very noticeable is the use of swearing which is the main reason I don t enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore New meaningless characters have been introduced into the story and the focus shifted far away from the main characters The cover character hardly says or does anything this time There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment but if you blink you will miss it This game is far more frustrating than challenging which is not a good game trait I don t recommend even playing this game before reading the above to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits If you re looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great you will be extremely disappointed The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided 
Not as expected I loved the first Xenosaga Then this arrived Episode 2 isen t a bad game in terms of the story the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE Then you get into a battle Now if you like tactical stuff this is a good game for you But if you re trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing I say save your money Gone is the amazingly well done battle system in the first episode In its place stands a completely out of nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps Ridiculous but that s not all The enemies have weak zones that depend of the height of the attack that you input The zones are A B and C A being the highest Triangle=C square=B and Circle=A SOMETIMES See what I mean It s completely screwed up and you have to become deeply addicted to the game to understand its full potential And if that wasn t enough they changed the voice actors too Kos Mos s voice sounds more like an operator than a robot s and Momo sounds like a brat At least chaos voice has improved I d prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel otherwise spend your moey on something else like Shadow Hearts for example 
The series killer Pros Mechs are a bigger part of the games you actually have to use them The graphics of the cutscreens are great and the graphics overall are better than before A couple of the characters look better Much harder than Episode I More optional bosses Cons New battle system is a load of mouse spunk can I say spunk Most characters look worse especially Kos Mos and Jin travels throughout space with no pants on Almost all of the sidequests are terrible Very short The story is much weaker The dictionary is gone and so are Shion s glasses No shops Why are there no shops Too much more to list Just bad The movie Howard the Duck is better than this 
Great Black Screen to Go with Every Question We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex We thought Oh this will be fun since the show is cool So we got home and played it and it was so annoying There s just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background Just don t buy it if you want to have any fun 
A very depressing effort that could ve been so much more When Disney Interactive released quot Who Wants to Be a Millionaire quot in early 2000 they anticipated a very warm response to the disc which had a firm but low opening price However when actually being played the game is sure to depress If it isn t crudely simple the design is poor and uninspired The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again quot Be Sure to come back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire quot quot I hope you ll join me again on Who Wants to be a Millionaire quot If one doesn t decide to resell or simply trash this game within its first week of purchase they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves Don t waste your time on this pitiful effort 
A repetitive flop I am extreamly dissapointd with this game Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location There is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings 
A bad knock off Hey have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s Yeah well this game is basically a knock off of that game with better graphics And quite frankly Caesar II was more fun I don t see how CivCity has any point You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh The makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series but they are inconsequential in this game These people should stick to what they are good at the Civilization series and leave city games to people who know how to do it I ve heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now Caesar IV and I haven t tried it but it has to be better than CivCity Rome This game is boring don t pay any money for it 
rip off I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension WRONG this is a bad rip off of Caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control This is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they ll stay Caesar IV that s what you re wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn t Feel like I ve wasted my money 
Sadly disappointed I was really looking forward to this game and I was prepared to overlook one or two things Every game has it s own personality right I found instead this game actually doesn t have much of one at all I didn t mind the graphics Not cutting edge sure but not that bad either A little muddy but a change from cartoony It was hard to enjoy closeup views however when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom No way to toggle that feature The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately Not that there was much time to look at the scenery Immigrants came And came And came Whether there were houses and jobs available or not As long as city happiness was high enough which meant that everyone was happy Which they were not Because they had no houses or jobs To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy Forget planning Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets It wasn t clear what the balance was in any case It would take trial and error and you didn t have the time For you were building worshops like mad trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade It was through research maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on You hit those early on and reached a certain population level you made money The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving There was no stability in reaching any level It quickly became a game of keep up There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development And for all the decorative options more than the similar games out you really didn t care in the end what your city looked like because it just cost time Money too but that was really not the relevant issue Unless people were unhappy Then you could stick a few things quickly somewhere You just can t enjoy a leisurely pace of planning building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run you have to be constantly involved in the process staying ahead of the curve You don t have to worry about maintenance such as city fires or engineers but the cities cannot not be made self sufficient or self sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities if not all to a screeching halt While I enjoyed the research options and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying 
Guilty by Association The Civ name has been tarnished Analogously one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier s name is on a product it doesn t mean the product is good In the case of CivCity Rome unfortunately it doesn t just come in at modestly good it comes in at dismally poor I ve tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general but after Civ4 came out I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out And now this I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago The offerings of today have a simple pattern the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release they take advantage of our love for the franchise This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating It almost seems especially with the release of CivCity Rome that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games Stay away from CivCity Rome Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good the narration and sound effects better or the interface to work properly The game is a dismal failure and I am sorry to report that It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis but they just cheesed it Watching what Maxis The Sims and SimCity franchises and Firaxis Civilization franchise are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
Don t Waste Your Money It has pretty much all been said let s just say it again cause I m sure Firaxis Firefly will plant positive reviews here The game takes ages to load the voice acting is silly British Australian Herman s Hermits the progression is totally linear ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels the graphics date to 2002 and the citizen fetching system is completely random and opaque Sit and watch for awhile your huts will change size every thirty seconds Most importantly boo Sid boo You could ve produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything but you called it CivCity and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it Haven t you got enough money The Civ Series is brilliant Don t cash it in 
Disappointing The games faults have been well covered already so I ll just say if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably 
Wait for it to hit the discount bins Like the other reviews I find this game a rip off of Caesare III I didn t know there was a IV Must look into that While the graphics are admirable the gameplay wasn t challenging at all It didn t take me any time at all to win and I m one of the worst game players ever OTOH it s a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals Don t buy it now Wait until it s cheap like 9 95 or something 
I HATE THIS GAME I swear if it wasn t that i liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much i d just break this game at then i d move on and be happy But i can t do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that i did nt want to waste money This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game Oh my god this is so childish You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn t feel like doing that in this one You are a monkey man How stupid is that Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one im just happy i beat in and can put that awful exp behind me AHHHHHHHHHH 
Just get Oblivion instead Graphics aren t the most important part of a game to me I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature Oblivion style RPG While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion I never got to see it because of the bad controls bad collision and lack of fun By bad collision I m talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease The controls make combat an unfun chore I m a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion If you ve never played Oblivion and don t have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it then maybe you ll get into Gothic 2 It has much lower system requirements 
Pretty overrated The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING I m a long time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme Plus for all the people talking about immersion I just don t see it I just couldn t get myself to care about the world or story I was in it didn t grab me like some games do 
What a disappointment Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it Clunky control system really put me off 
Useless buggy recognition code The concept for this game is strong and it s got some cute ideas but the voice recognition especially for the word blue and the character recognition is abysmal It makes the game an exercise in frustration more than anything else As to character recognition unless you write in whatever font the game is programmed to recognize it s going to record your answers as something different than what you wrote You are penalized when the system doesn t recognize blue or the correct number If the system is so rigid that it only accepts one way of saying blue then the system should have a sound file that tells you what it wants to hear As to the number recognition it should have a screen that shows you how the system wants the numbers written or it should be able to allow you to enter your numbers and correlate them to numbers within the system When I make this mark it = 4 Also the intro content is absurdly long with no way to skip over it Huge waste of time after the first 10x you ve seen it I just got the game today and I ve spent hours trying to figure out a way to say blue such that the game will recognize it now I just wish I could return opened software I m very frustrated with the entire experience 
A lot of hype doesn t deliver Everyone seemed really excited about this game supposed to be a great launch title etc Turns out that Red Steel fails to deliver like Dominoes during a hurricane The graphics are meh Ubisoft could have done way better and controls are a bit awkward This isn t because of the Wii controller itself having played Zelda and Wii sports I can say that the controller works very very well So I am inclined to think that the bulkiness of shooting in Red Steel and the fact that using your sword is more like clubbing a baby seal then fighting with the grace of a master samurai has to do with the game design not any fault of the controller The storyline isn t that amazing either Pretty straight forward neverending quest to save your girlfriend brownie points if you got the pop culture reference shoot a lot of Japanese people in the process Nothing innovative to see here move along now It could have been a lot better I m selling this one back to EBgames and getting Trauma Center instead Disappointing launch title 
Pretty Annoying This was the first Wii game I got and its mostly because I couldn t get a hold of Zelda Red Steel looks promising Certainly its controls are good but it feels more like a game that s supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment A tutorial of sorts The problem is that it isn t much fun to deal with You play as Scott a man in Japan with his girlfriend You suddenly find out that her father is a Yakuza Mob boss and that he s got tons of enemies Your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle It s pretty simple stuff Most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards The graphic novel storyboards look interesting but its really painful that you can t skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes This is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over again Red Steel s appeal is its gameplay which seems to be the focus of the game The controls are solid for the most part but again the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the Wii remote You use the remote to aim at enemies and the B button to shoot The nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons reload said weapon and tip over tables you ll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it The nunchuck is also how you ll move around You can strife from side to side and you can move forward The nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck You ll be doing a lot of ducking The remote is responsible for most of the gameplay It allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another The game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at You ll be able to use the remote for several things You can lock onto enemies with the A button and if you hold the A button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen or you can zoom out It s all pretty cool but the remote is extremely sensitive Just the slightest flick to the left and you ll look to the left It s great to actually point and shoot at an enemy your accuracy is really important but now it s all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy Granted the controls take time to get used to but they flow particularly well Swordfights are another story though These are annoying sequences actually Mostly because the controls are clumbsy You ll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and you ll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck At first this is fun but its so limited When fighting with swords you can t pull out a weapon This is bad when you re in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword You ll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up And they ll STILL fire at you and you ll lose health There s no way to back out of sword fights either and that s also really annoying The controls just feel clumbsy as well especially with its extreme sensitivty To the gameplay s credit there are some interesting things you can do For starters when you re not shooting someone and you re ducking behind something your health refills At first this makes the game seem easy but you have to understand that if you re taking damage or shooting at all your health doesn t refill So this doesn t make the game incredibly easy Also after a sword fight you ll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life Sparing his life earns you respect which you can use to learn more techniques The game doesn t look fantastic but it s not bad looking either It s visual presentation is alright but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches There are moments where you ll be staring an enemy right in the face and he won t move Won t flinch or even attack you He just stands there waiting to be killed Sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they can t see you when you re in plain sight There are also moments where I shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence There are probably more bugs than this found within the game but it was hard to take after a while There are a couple of other annoying aspects of the gameplay as well You can only hold two weapons at a time This isn t as annoying as it sounds but I wish I could ve held on to more Luckily ammo is not hard to come by at all There are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out Enemies shooting through walls This game is just full of them I wish I could say it sounds good but it doesn t The voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isn t great either Some levels sound good but there s nothing memorable here Red Steel has a good control scheme going for it but that s really all it has going for it It s not a fantastic game by any means The bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying It s hard to recommend this game even to die hard first person shooter fans The Good +The control scheme works +Well there is lots of action The Bad Tons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game enemies who don t attack or walk right past you Enemies who can t see you in plain sight Bullets going through walls or through your enemies this game is full of them and they detract from the gameplay Sword fighting is clumbsy You can only wield two weapons at once When you re forced into a sword fight there s no way you can get out of it until the fight is over Horrible voice acting There s really no story to it The controls while good just seem like another ploy to get one used to the Wii Remot 
I want my money back I really wanted to like this game unfortunately for me it blows I d trade it for a migraine if I could The gameplay is pretty horrible the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992 where you press the Attack key and swing your sword aimlessly at the bad guy The run gun part of the game is nothing to write home about either It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked out 1 legged drunken monkey Also I know the graphics aren t the Wii s strong point but that is no excuse to regress back to 8 bit When you re trying to shoot someone across the room it really sucks when you can t tell them apart from a flower pot or is that a lawn chair The cut scene s were obviously supposed to look like Sin City I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding They look like an amateur flash slide show Kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah This game is a joke Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed 
Could be a lot funner Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century Though many of the novels were very well written they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book Icewind Dale II is like that It looks nice it supposedly improves gameplay and it gives the player more character creation options but I just don t really want to play it Why Well at the end of the day it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly it is just not as fun as its predescessor I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur s Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option I was wrong I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarassing to take part in I was confronted with gameplay that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored I tried to play it again but again I was plagued with the same problems I installed a bunch of unofficial patches but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur s Gate II where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path Furthermore the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale In fact the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb I was mostly familiar with the rules but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive All in all I do not think that this is a good game I would just go with Baldur s Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game 
A great disappointment Firstly I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games I loved BG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequal to which I found to be honest awful I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd with the exception of NWN but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn t bother me much It s a computer game after all the exact mechanics of the system I dont have to understand The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs It got to the point where I could simply leave my game runing for an hour or two while my chacters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned criters It got boring really fast Not too mention difficult as well The really sad part was when I read the general plot outline I was enthusiastic I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade But when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army this is the point where in pen and paper RPG s that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it 
A turd dressed in gorgeous graphics Image if you took all those aspects of an MMORPG that everyone complains about The lack of story the constant level griding the stingy monetary system the stingy experience system quests that require the FAQ and completely stupid party members That in a nutshell is what FFXII is like It starts out well though with strong characters beautiful graphics and good playablity If the game had stopped at about 30 hours in it would have shined as a great game But 40 MORE hours of grinding and subquests are neccessary past that point where there s almost no story In fact what story there IS gives a strong indication that you shouldn t actually BE doing what the story wants you to do Truth be told the game is terrible when all is said and done and the rediculous ramping up of difficulty as the game progresses the absurdity of the License Point system and the very concept of BUYING AI routines so your party isn t hopelessly stupid which they still generally are completely ruin the experience Once the Final Fantasy series was the standout line of console role playing games How the mighty have fallen It s not the worst RPG out on the market but it s easily the worst of the franchise and one of the worst of the past couple of years Play any of the other Final Fantasy games instead and give this one a complete pass 
Wanted to like it Lack of balance if one thing could be pointed at as the problem it is the lack of balance The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn t pan out As has been mentioned the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle Also the monotony of the enemies left me wanting During one area of the game in the Sandsea I had a chain of 164 I wasn t trying to get chain points either No matter how good the battle system was designed 164 of the same enemy in a row gets boring The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX I loved the sphere grid wasn t so fond of this system Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure At level 20 Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid although her highest level magick that was of use was Cura hardly an impressive skill The storyline was like riding a snail Too many cut scenes and not enough interesting developments The gil distribution was down right ridiculous Leveling up for hours exploring every nook and cranny of a dungeon and still not having enough money to improve your weapons there just wasn t a good balance There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting in past games leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII For nearly every enemy I remember you got 1 license point per kill By a rough estimation 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system The last rant was the character classes or lack of Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want for a necessary price While the openness can be good it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost After all so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind note I mentioned a weapon there are no special abilities unique to any character either Between the lack of rewards gil ability increases with experience and monotony of battles I would not recommend this game I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt the mini games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental Naturally another person may like everything I ranted on above Like any FF game you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted I lost interest in the middle of the addiction stage 
FFXII is hobbled by novel design I want to take a moment to address the battle system and the license system These systems while well conceived have completely ruined the game for me For example the license system is itself a very good idea It allows the player to craft the character to his liking and tastes The problem lies in the execution Say for example you want to learn Steal Not only do you have to get the license for it but you also have to purchase it in the game This presents problems In my game for example my characters possess a suite of licenses that they cannot use because the shops don t carry that particular item The system gives you flexibility but snatches it away by requiring that you not only get the license but to also find the item I can t help but to feel hobbled by the license system Because these items which require licenses come at discrete parts of the game the developers have cunningly shot up the difficulty It doesn t matter that I earned the license for Shield of Fire at level 4 I can only get it at level 20+ when its offered in a shop The game is very challenging precisely because the mechanics prevent characters from getting better than normal equipment after they earned the license The sly artificial way the developers of FFXII ramped up the difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary and unnecessary The cap of three playable characters at one time is the straw that breaks the camel s back Lastly the battle system in my opinion isn t fitting for a console RPG It feels like I am playing World of Warcraft or City of Heroes The enemies are always faster than you It s nigh impossible to chase them down and they always are able to catch up with you Fighting with a bow is an exercise in futility the enemies will catch you because the game freezes you in place during firing The R2 button which allows you to flee borders between being useless to outright deadly to use While fleeing the game prevents you from interacting with objects So if you flee toward a door you have to stop pause let them hit you before you can escape My mouth gaped open when I saw the reviews for the game online This game received astronomical scores some heralding it as the best Final Fantasy ever That shocks me beyond belief FFXII would be a better MMORPG and an even sharper two player RPG As a single player game with shoddy A I mechanics the game plays like a tumbling rock Perhaps I am just too old school but this game tastes too much like lollipops and bubblegum Your mileage may vary 
Gotta give em credit for creativity This game looked so crazy I couldn t resist it I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much but in the USA it s just insane On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids game but aren t games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it s just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama It s like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game Planet Alice in Wonderland consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die The worst of it is respawning monsters you can t take a step without having to fight and re fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated Because of this you ll spend the majority of your money on healing items Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill 30 minutes is normal Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game I know that Kingdom Hearts 2 Mushashi Samurai Legend and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past 
So Stupid Now before you say anything I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster grudgingly playing it though and now for the unbaiased opinion I think that this game is so completely stupid It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion 
Shipping sucks ass I really could not tell you anything as I still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago 
More like Chrono Crap Please promise me you will never play this It is not worth your time If you paid money for it try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin Hard Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster Seriously though this game is absolutely terrible The graphics are bad even for the PSX the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless There was no reason for there being 40 something characters most of them were exactly the same statwise and all of them were poorly designed The most annoying thing in the world bar nothing is having to re equip all your character s spells whenever you switch characters You have like 50 spell slots God I don t think I even need to say it but those crumbums at Square couldn t pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on lest they risk making something like this again 
Difficult visually The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar we rented it It s very hard to control the c stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn t rotate the camera except for certain times The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c stick to zoom in it still wasn t close enough It s the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly Another aspect we didn t like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor Maybe we re spoiled because the c stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions It s surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite 
For experienced players I loved The Incredibles so I was excited to play the game I ve only been playing video games the last couple years and only off and on so I m really just a beginner Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I ve had with this game My boyfriend is a long time video game player and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy I almost cried LOL But seriously unless you are a good gamer you re probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game As for me I guess I ll stick to action RPGs 
the key they gave me didn t work hi it was impossible to use this product because the key they gave me didn t work i might make a fisbee out of the dvd jerr 
Like europe politics it stinks Bought this Platinum game with much anticipation and it doesn t work at all Tried the download exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too No one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game If they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like Blizzard does and companies like Westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company or its affiliates I think they are Alkida implants trying to take over the western world If you want to play a game with style then wait until June and get Titan s Quest which should be finally a Diablo 3 Too bad this company couldn t find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy Spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new Patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to Iran 
No Starforce but does not work I have a pretty decent computer Athlon64 3000+ Radeon X550 but this game does not work at all Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the CPU until I kill the process Aspyr support is unable to help That said despite other reviews here this game does NOT install Starforce But maybe that s why my version won t work 
This game is not for PC users I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less This game when played on the X Box was great So when it came out for PC I bought it BIG MISTAKE The control are too hard to learn And when you are in a battle you can t stop to think which keys when used together work There are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing I wasted my money on this game I deleted it and will never play it Don t waste your money 
TOTAL JIP this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at ALL i hate this game so MUCH it is literally the worst DBZ game i have ever played and i have played them all i advise you if ur looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER 
Just another FPS all prettied up and overblown Have you played any of the games in the Doom series How about Metroid Prime Medal of Honor Golden Eye Well then you ve played Halo 2 also because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same I don t care how many times X Box magazine odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X BOX game is the system s magazine calls it the greatest game of all time I d rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme utterly mundane unoriginal boring and just all around unentertaining The gameplay is so generic that it s as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer the music is cliche the voice acting is flat and Master Chief is just an all around retard The weapons oh boy the weapons again another lame aspect of the game The alien s weapons are like something in the kid s toy gun section from Toys R Us and the human guns are nothing that I haven t used in a Resident Evil game When the first Halo came out I didn t get the big deal I didn t even play it then eventually I got myself an X Box and decided to give this installment a shot huge mistake Come to think of it none of the games of X box are even worth owning a system for Fable was decent but got old after beating it a few times The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring and everything else on X Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube 
Great physics details potential but wasted Halo 1 on steroids Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie s creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense and has no flow along with levels that aren t replayable You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious Try the headache inducing map design in this game Also in the nonsense the unneccesary switch to an Elite s perspective for half the game along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon Apes with mohawks yeah nice design I can only play one or two levels of the single player and they are so noobish it loses appeal quickly On to Multiplayer Okay in 2004 upon release this was a great game It took time to go up in level and the ranking system wasn t as abused as it is now Once new maps kept on the harddrive read mod kids were released by Bungie that opened the door to full blown chaos Now 2 years later modding has died down somewhat but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25 likely you ll find a game with no lag So I still play on occasion it s lame they can t offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice choose servers with good connections and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too I only pray Halo 3 s multiplayer improves on this system otherwise I m done with the Xbox console permanently 
Good Game But I Just Didn t Enjoy It There is nothing majorly wrong with this game The plot is well developed the characters are customizable and the battles are strategic This is probably primarily subjective but I just didn t enjoy this game It s not because there were too many movies it s because I didn t like the movie I also didn t like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure Which button to press was often counterintuitive and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button Also the game badly needs a journal and or a destination guide so you know where to go I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go 
Misguided Copy Protection This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I ve ever experienced I bought this game new at a local store because I ve been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card Got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed Tried it with the other disc failed again Went to the company s support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund 
Starforce = Hardware damage Don t buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need ed for my DVD burner Check the search engines and see for yourself Would have otherwise been a great game too bad it isn t playable because of this malware 
Starforce=Coaster Starforce nothing else need be said Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games I don t know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS Gaming Laptop 
Install Problems I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice It would not run I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again it would not run When I went to the knowledge base technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card the game will not work on your system In short if you have an over the counter system you cannot run this game on your computer I find this ridiculous and disappointing I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box 
Don t Bother With It This game sucks It tries to be Sim City with extra features Unfortunately the graphics are way below average In fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short 
StarForce This game has StarForce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer Reportedly it replaces your CD and or DVD drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems I ve been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it It could be the best game that s ever been produced but anyone who s had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear 
BECAUSE ZERO ISN T POSSIBLE I actually recieved this from a friend of mine which he bought for 0 98 Anyway I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting but were only sold over in the UK and so on He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader So I took it home and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2 and just recieved it today to my surprise not actually the damn thing didn t work Now I m stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD s DON T BUY THIS PRODUCT It is junk However I am thankful that I didn t even buy this product but it was given to me I hope that someone planning on buying this reads my review first IT S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY 
Zero stars is not an option I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague 
TERRIBLE PRODUCT Costs you more than you paid for AVOID THIS PRODUCT wait till PS3 with it s Hard drive an hope something better will come out Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE one whoops an it s destroyed Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place BAD STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD CARDS One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of gameplay ALSO the disc sucks when the PS2 is warm it won t recognize the disc if you break or mess the disc up no way you can make a copy of it an use that Your screwed GOOD The codes work an it s great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before If you have complaints call Datels US office 727 431 065 
Order now and we ll throw in a set of premium steak knives FROM AMAZON CA The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer VGE or at least it claims to be My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region free DVD player and a memory card compression utility squeeze more saves onto your memory card I have not used either of these features personally but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards some reusable some permanently damaged This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it However the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I ll get to those in a second The ARMax like the newer Gamesharks loads its software from a CD This is a major annoyance for me Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card which does I don t know what and CD go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load choose your codes then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load You can t simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it If you wanted it to load before the game you turned on its switch Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way and it s not btw it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first I mean why can t the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you re playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don t have to load the software EVERY D MN TIME Ok rant over On to the codes The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark Functionally they are very similar of course but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions not for user entered ones though if I remember right and a more robust Expert Mode On big advantage in theory that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2 s broadband connection The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download its all or nothing And since these updates are stored on your memory card not the ARMax one it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99 of which you will NEVER play No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card It s to store all the useless codes Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work do nothing or lock up the game I have come across all though to ARMax s credit mostly the former The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library when you may want just one loses the ARMax another star A note about manually entering codes The sub headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game s code list Finally as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols Amazon ca the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL This happened for me as well I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions at the time of ARMax I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine I assume any bought today would not have this problem However at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars In my opinion if you re in the market for a VGE both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have Looks at the specs assume nothing and don t be afraid to e mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about I apologize for the length of this review but I find there are very few in depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs I don t know 
Don t buy it will corrupt your files and lose saves I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a USB flash drive I have not been able to get either to work correctly After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card It also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 I have had nothing but trouble with it it s slow and doesn t live up to the promises Their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry Well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves 
This thing actually has a use now I honestly do not like cheat devices but since Wild Arms 4 came out it actually now has a use Let me explain Unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing the company that translated Wild Arms 4 it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a Gameshark Since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you ll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this If it wasn t for this reason I wouldn t even be interested in this product 
If you have the newer slim ps2 design then Then this will not work on your console But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark 
Sony Playstation 2 Remote I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD s on the PS2 easier I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work I hoped it would get better but it only got worse I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away I would NEVER recommend this product 
Garbage As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recomend it to any one I do not know why it was ever released Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers 
BUYER BEWARE This intercooler WILL ruin your 360 with prolonged use I was getting Error 68 codes and couldn t figure out why Turns out it was the Intercooler sucking too much power from the 360 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I had this in my cart and just Thought it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment I cannot thank ALL of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do Thank you all again mckinle 
Please do not BUY This product was not designed by the 360 team and really most products that aren t aren t very good for your 360 This is no exception it can and has been known to actually damage and destroy your 360 A statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people Mainly because it actually draws power from the 360 and that s not good and leads to a lot of other problems 
Worse than before My Xbox was getting the red rings of death figured this was most likely due to overheating so I bought this thing Not only did it not fix any of my troubles I was having more Whenever I would bump my Xbox the whole thing would shut off instantly Found this out by accident come to find out this thing has very bad connections So for 20 you can buy more headaches than Microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts 
Do not get this This is the worst item you can get for your 360 I got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360 It was crashing and freezing and ultimately I had to get my console repaired Do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby 360 
Be VERY CAREFUL when considering this product I ll be brief First of all out of the 81 reviews of this product currently on Amazon 31 are 1 star That should tell you something Pros When it actually works it does cool down your 360 Cons 1 Crashing Caused more crashes than it prevented Running without the Nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems I had 2 Loud as hell Turn on your 360 Put a hairdryer next to it and turn it on on low Step back and sit where you normally play That is how loud this product will make your 360 3 Hard to set up frequently stops working It took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time It snap fits well to the back of the 360 but despite that there s some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector we re talking millimeter tolerances here If you re off by just a tiny bit it won t work at all and the XBox won t even power on This wouldn t be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once but no it s loose enough that you risk disconnecting it and setting it up all over again every time you touch the power cord or move the 360 4 Many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their 360s You better have a replacement plan for your 360 handy and never mention the Nyko when you try to RMA your box If you let it slip you probably won t be covered That s it for the Nyko I returned mine within 2 weeks I ve been searching for a good cooler for the 360 since I got one Unfortunately it is my opinion that there are NO GOOD COOLERS FOR THE 360 ON THE MARKET The fan stands yes I ve bought and returned them are decent coolers but require you to run your 360 vertically which is a big no no A number of websites have shown that the 360 DVD rom drive will EAT your DVDs and games when it s vertical I had hoped this was overexaggerated but then the problems started happening to me I ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my mint condition games when running the 360 vertically I also experienced frequent game loading problems including hideous slowdowns in games like Halo 2 where you can actually see a progress bar when played on a vertical 360 it worked just fine with it horizontally So horizontal is the way to go In the end I ended up building my own cooler out of some old still loud but MUCH QUIETER computer fans and a 12 volt adapter and slapped it on the side Works well probably cools as well as the Nyko but without the noise or the crashing Your best bet if you can t do something like that is to just buy a little clip fan with its own power adapter and have it blow into the right side bottom the vents away from the DVD drive of your 360 
DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY I bought this for my XBox 360 and it doesn t work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews I ve read here At least by not working it isn t damaging my Xbox 360 
don t buy this I bought this from Best Buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my Xbox360 a longer life and keep it s insides cool When I plugged it in my Xbox360 didn t turn on AT ALL After trying it several times I took it off and plugged in the AC adapter back on to my Xbox For a while the Xbx wouldn t turn on I thought it was broken I gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that Intercooler nearly broke my Xbox DON T BUY IT 
Broken Pointless First of all it s sad that someone would put out a product the 360 that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans Second I attached this I plugged it in It wouldn t even turn on Waste of money Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area If you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it 
Better to Rent than Buy I played this game until Chapter 23 All the Dancing Levels were VERY HARD to beat I think this game is not worth buying rent it 
Holy Hannah Please tell me there is a cheat for level 3 My son begged for this game and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection He enjoyed levels 1 2 but once we got to level 3 that was it Unless you have earned the nickname Fast fingers or Fury Feet don t bother purchasing this until you rent it I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible about 57 accurate as I did actually keeping up Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the Dance Levels get harder from here Good Luck 
rated N for nobody This game is a joke It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them Don t buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out It is was a waste of money my kids won t even play it It should be rated N for Nobody 
As bad if not worse than the movie The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun The kids didn t even like it Run don t walk away from this dentist office of a game JAWS cr p JAWS = Just another W Smith 
weak movie weak game my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i 
The good and the bad mostly bad It s got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had The Good Unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving The Bad Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story 
This game is totally inappropriate We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play After watching my son play this game for a few minutes I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive Then after that he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died I can t believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids or whoever played it have to be so mean to animals What s next ripping the head off a rabbit I consider myself one of the coolest moms around but this totally crossed the line 
Repetitive and tedious I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar For starters I ve always been irritated with games that don t let you save your status whenever you want Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay but that s not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save That contributes to the repetitive tedious nature of some sections If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game you re doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game More than in the earlier versions however I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task Another tedious element I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun 
Cheap wiring I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend s daughter for her birthday She loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead It started with the static for a while but then while I was singing it just died completely I know I m not a great singer but I m not THAT bad 
Died after two times I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing it completely died What a complete disappointment Save your money 
Ummm no This game is simply put not good I got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk It is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all In fact these characteristics are probably why it s so mainstream even though it s laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way don t even belong on consoles Owning at this game means you are an average player Any true FPS gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it s worth anything at all It isn t 
EHHH I used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it s just not good 
EA should have quit while ahead I purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn t run it I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone It worked They win They got my money and I got jack 
buyer beware The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system press 2 now EA s manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes I could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund I would never buy another EA product 
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT I bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that I need one for each GBA or SP So I bought another one for my son Then after we couldn t get them to work consulted Nintendo we found that the wireless adapter doesn t work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version Some gift 
Less than ideal I have always been a fan of fighting games As far as 3D ones go I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2 I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5 Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example Her idle animation is preposterous If you have access to Dead or Alive 3 try putting out Leifang Her idle animation is a thing of beauty Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5 And now let us speak of character design Tekken 5 s characters are boring and uninspired They run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer 1 2 3 and 4 to miscellaneous karate fighter 1 2 3 and 4 Oh There are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing some of which seem to be Asian if that s your thing And then there s a guy in a cat mask As awesome as that sounds it looks silly in the game If you have ever played Practice Mode on Dead or Alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move This feature as useful as it is is not present in Tekken 5 To be fair it isn t found in any other fighting game that I have played but it really should be Without further ado let me simply say that I do not recommend buying Tekken 5 if you have ever played Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive The intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer I especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten But at least Mortal Kombat Deception had Puzzle Kombat which rocked my socks 
Can be very frustrating Sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss Jinpachi is really cheap and lame Even at the easy difficulty just a couple of hits from this freak and you re dead The Devil Within mini game is also stupid some levels are just impossible and too hard I wouldn t mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here not to mention some save points are hidden Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can t save your game then you re gonna have to redo the entire level again That is one sick stupid game design The only reason I m playing this mini game is just to get the hidden items 
Great idea horrible product If you re looking to spend money on this don t Having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a Commodore 64 and being the current fan that I am I was really excited when I heard about this product Unfortunately it stinks There are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems the rest being mediocre at best The overall bad choice of games isn t my issue with this thing though It s the CRUMMY JOYSTICK Control is horrible The stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore As someone else pointed out in their review often it doesn t even respond when pushed in a certain direction I can t believe it s 2006 yet these companies releasing plug n play video game contraptions can t even make a decent joystick A real letdown 
could be better Not as much fun as I remember Maybe better if they had a better selection of games One on One Hardball etc 
A bargain in disappointment I purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting However what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product 
It s seems great until you realize the joystick doesnt work I was really excited when I saw this item was out I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick doesn t work at ALL when you move it to the right So you can only use it to go up down or left BIG Dissapointment Don t waste your 
Now I need a new XBOX DOn t buy this it will crash your entire xbox Learn to play forget the cheats 
Not what I expected If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had this is not for you Not only do you HAVE to have a computer If anything happens to the disk you are screwed You won t be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion So if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there 
cheaper toys r us returned item for refund found it cheaper at Toys R U 
STINKS SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE AND SOFTWARE IS VEERY CONFUSING HORRIBLE BUY I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK 
Did not like this game I dont have much to say other than I did not like this game I was hoping that it was going to be like Fusion Frenzy for the Xbox but it was not nearly as fun The controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good Some people may like it but I didn t 
They destroyed the mini games I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it I own ALL of them and so when I stood in line all night Saturday and through Sunday morning 8am I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii I bought an entire set of controllers anticipating the mini game fun with all my friends We re huge SMB fans all of us It always makes an appearance at our parties But now I m really angry They completely gutted our favorite mini game s hitting Monkey Target worst of all I can honestly say I don t care that there are 50 freakin mini games because now Monkey Target is completely worthless Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items increasingly difficult levels magnets velcro double bonuses wind speed and direction and the all import ramp run off you have a cannon one level no wind or wind direction no bonuses and no special items Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level Monkey squash no joy there A lot of the controls for the mini games are terrible And so on so forth The new mini games suck almost unilaterally but gosh darn there are 50 of them But volume does not make up for lack of quality I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB Banana Blitz are nice The graphics are beautiful and fun But the best part of the game for me and my friends is now gone and dead None of the reviews I d read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this and if they had I certainly wouldn t have wasted my 50 plus tax If Sega people are reading this BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET That s what people play at parties when they re slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party 
Absolutely Boring At First When I Got It It Seemed Fun Then As The Minutes Go By It Got Boring Quick The Missions Suck The Bosses Are Too Hard I Just Sold My Game If You Buy This Game You ll Be Doing The Sam 
Stinker I really liked the first two Jak games so I was excited to try Jak 3 Whoa Major mistake This game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe I was very disappointed in this game If you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere 
obviously most of you have never used a wireless controller before Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries put it this way you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days and that is not cool at all I will be buying the wire controlers from now on The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great but again let me stresss this issue it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller that you just put batteries in well at least you thought you did die and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight 
False Advertisement This is a perfect example of false advertisement If you re like the many that i ve heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2 Don t order this one unless you have a newer model The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn t come with one So save yourself the hassle and don t order this 
Might be good game couldn t get it to download completely My son 7 used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday It came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play We kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient We don t do much PC gaming but we have a fairly new Dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient If the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we wouldn t have wasted his time We have yet to receive credit for this item A HUGE HASSLE We ll stick to the PS2 games from now on 
just another RPG yawn how many RPG s can this world make they re all the same open this container take weapons and health kits from this dead body use this spell KOTOR is no different sadly the combat IMHO is just really boring when you see an enemy the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make if that doesn t kill the enemy your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves umm how many times has this been done before if i wanted that i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they re on now all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers it s the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack look it up the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it 
WHY buy this I saw a DVD player at Target for 30 yesterday I especially don t see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it s 40 Space saving maybe 
Simplicity A simple DVD player as long as you or a friend own an X box console Simply push in a little plastic knob into the controler socket and their you go oyu know own a standard of the line DVD player The maginfacation is great the rewind and fastfrward is great It has all the extras a normal DVD player has and a easy to operate menu and layout No overloads of pointless buttons just point out the obvious structer You may be dissapointed in the response time but that is not entirely the remote or players fault If you own an old x box console or a low memory X box console you may encounter slowness and maxed out freezing Some mint condition titles may not even work I purchased Little Nicky sometime ago mint and to this date it still does not work on my X box console Batteries may play a roll With out a doubt though this is the most easy and portable DVD player around with the acknowledgement of owning an X box console first A must have for a gamer movie lover wit ha large movie library or a constant renter 
Get only if you don t have a stand alone DVD player already Hey kids fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90 s and don t already have a DVD player Like my title suggests if you already have a DVD player this is a waste of money The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD R s that I got from a friend I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD R s in question with no problem However aside from those two DVD R s all of the DVD s I own are bought from retail stores so I really have no need to play DVD R s and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly With that being said I only used XBOX s DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD R s I had problems with Because of the content of these burned movies there is really no need to watch them again However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC s or Mac to watch the burned DVD no need to use my XBOX for that I meant to return the DVD kit the next day but never got around to it The XBOX s DVD player is a good feature but the fact that Microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money unless of course you don t have a DVD player at all 
Broke after 20 minutes My only experience with this product was after I opened it and started to play a DVD in my Xbox when I tried to pause it it didn t work and it had brand new batteries I found after much frustration that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so I just got my money back You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs 
ATTENTION DO NOT USE THIS the dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox 
Unfortunate Sequel I would blame this game sucking on the Wii it is unfortunate that the sequel to COD2 had to be this game I played it on the X Box 360 and it wasn t good there either I was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour After that I couldn t bring myself to touch it again 
Disappointing although some appeal can be found I m going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC only gamer I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion activated actions within the game rowing throwing grenades close combat etc As a result after spending the night out in the cold to get my console and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise I grabbed three games Zelda a no brainer Trauma Center and Call of Duty 3 Of those three titles I m sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth As I have stated before I am a PC gamer I m really into my hobby and love the satisfaction of building a PC which can manage all the latest games I played CoD 1 and 2 on the PC and greatly enjoyed both By far the biggest problem with the Wii version however especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer are the graphical shortcomings of the title I literally had no idea what was going on I could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why I was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels Added to this I had no idea how to get rid of the first German to engage me in hand to hand combat a much advertised feature which is actually just an interactive cut scene I followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly and although I worked myself into a frenzy causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me that inevitable German I tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in kept clubbing me to death Even beyond this setback I found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented It is also disappointing yet speaks volumes that the grenade throwing function that involves you actually throwing the nunchuck without letting go by the way unless you ve got a backup TV is disabled by default trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target get cut down blow yourself up For the record I know that the Wii controller works I ve played many hours of other games already as the system conveniently informs you This just seems like a shoddy implementation of it I can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes Nevertheless it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which even to my gameplay over graphics mentality in buying the Wii blocks the enjoyability of this title To be honest it has made me think that WW2 isn t the best suited area for the Wii After all these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements My advice on the FPS front wait for the Wii Far Cry game and see how that turns out In the meantime there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the Wii graphics waiting for your attention Before leaving you I d just like to clarify on thing this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles Perhaps you re reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the Wii straight from a gamecube instead of PC high definition gaming Oh and if you re still determined to buy it keep an eye out for my used copy of the game I m going to need the money for Banana Blitz 
Beware the controls are terrible I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails What they didn t say was that it s almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller which is what you really need to do For anything but shooting all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour s play time I had to take a break to rest my aching joints In case you haven t seen it the G Con2 gun has a teeny weeny directional pad on the back of it and it s this that you are expected to use to move yourself around Now if you try holding the gun in a standard aiming style you ll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs And they don t sit still waiting to be shot So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time And guess what It s impossible Bravo Capcom Oh sorry they didn t stop there but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time And be able to pull the trigger But even that s the end of it if you want still more pain try using sniper mode As you may have realised the control scheme completely spoiled the gameplay for me I m not fumble handed by any means but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this Which is a shame because a free roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle which means you don t have to worry about movement at all hooray The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T Rex are probably the most fun in the game The rest is ruined by the controls which make your life hell I ll tell you something else too most levels have a TIME LIMIT In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero so if you don t rush through the stage it s game over for you Kind of negates the joy of free roaming doesn t it You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B killing everything that moves might as well be on rails I don t know why this stupid condition was added as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game It s a real waste of potential but it s only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release If you buy it you have only yourself to blame I managed to finish it the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonising hand cramps to get through Save yourself I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don t have to Could have been a great game but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun 
Horrible I really wanted to see how the developers could represent playing as a dragon and spyro is the only one that came to mind at the time I decided to get it I put it in my console turned it on and was blown away by the stupidity Basic Story Is stupid Bad dragon plant mean gems to kill good dragon Spyro good dragon defeat evil dragon Everybody dances because goodness prevailes Gameplay An atrocious story can be overlooked if the gameplay is good mario but spyro has probably the worst gameplay ever It combines horrible precise jumping puzzles with abysmally stupid enemies The puzzles require you to tap the jump button at a certain time If you don t you go back to the beginning of the puzzle It was maddeningly hard at some points and I am grown So how hard would it be for a kid For the enemies they should get the darwin award At many instances I was breathing flame it has a limited reach and the enemy walked right into it The enemies are dumber then a retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than Paris Hilton Also they are very weak dying in 1 2 hits There are also very few types of enemies like around 2 6 but they have the same AI and equally pose no challenge seeing as they are weak and attack you one at a time The boss battles are so simple they make you want to shoot yourself at how moronic they are Also playing as the other characters hunter blinx etc are not that fun In conclusion don t make the mistake I made and steer clear of this game Get better ones for yourself whomever you are giving a gift to Oh and don t listen to the other people who gave this crudhole good reviews they are either A Retarded or B Never played a decent game 
Spyro a heros tail i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one What happened this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game 
DEFECT Doesn t work on Slim PS2 I haven t even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my PS2 After the PS2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens I thought it was maybe just that disc but I exchanged it and the same thing happened I called Ubisoft and they said many people with the Slim PS2 have called to say it doesn t work but they don t have any answers Sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many PS2 s Do not buy if you don t want the risk of it not working 
I was looking forward to this As one that couldn t stand NBA Ballers I thought I would give this game a try Pros create a baller Nice graphics Cons Defense If you are a fan of Pheonix Sun basketball you will love this game The announcer needs to learn ENGLISH The whole I Ball Trick Stick is horrible and will have you sreaming as you re stuck on the second side game that is required before you can advance on And 1 tour That stupid mic trick that allows you to score 4 points with one shot Stupid Watch This Trick that you can t stop despite the fact that you can still move your player You can t even block You can not choose who you want to face in other game modes unless you are playing two player Guess which game I ll be trading for NBA Live 2007 or WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007 this fall 
Lacking on most games and especailly this Bull s t game Ok let me break itdown for you The Game isn t all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year Really you really can t blame them that made this game The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out I Promise you that year want disoponte So dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 Dont waiste your mone 
What a waste of good graphics This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from As it is right now it s just a really really really crappy version of Zelda Orcarina of Time If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
This game blows period Don t be fooled by the advertisments that you see in almost every magazine Blitz doens t offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible The greatest inconvience of the game is the load times They are WAY too long Loading up your profile is an inconvience loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save you start to think F ck this The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play Then there is the gameplay itself Bone crushing hits Please outside of the occasional dirty hit which is far easier for the computer to employ on you than vice versa the hits look like the early developments of Madden The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4th quater when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays conventionally treat him and he misses a quater Either way you ll never miss him This game is horrible from the graphics to the load times Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest 
Logitech Cordless Headset for Xbox I ordered this from amazon it shipped from 3btech and ive had no luck with it the communicator its self is quite comfortable but i cannot comment on the quality of the mic or the audio that comes through it because it will not charge i called logitech tech support and the tech asked me the usual questions is it plugged in have you tried a different wall outlet have you tried jiggling the plug at the communicator end and so on after all the questions the tech said that it was defective and that they were running dangerously low on stock of that particular one So i guess what im trying to say is order at ur own risk and i hope you have better luck with it than i did 
dont buy this just wait for 360 ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one i no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also and to this day he constantly has to say hold up im switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360 
A big disappointment This game was a really big disappointment for me I had to try this game because of all the hype and all the reviews here Having played the Nintendo 64 game titled Mario Kart 64 I felt like it was not much of an improvement In fact I feel that Mario Kart 64 was a better game The only improvement was in the graphics Still why do the characters not have fingers In this stage of the game you would think that they would have fingers by now Anyway after I played the game I played a bit cheated I was bored by it within ten minutes The game is supposed to shine with multiplayer but it fizzled There are so many GameCube racing games out there that are so much better than this game at a much lower price One example of a better combat racing game is Burnout If you can get any one of the games in this series you will see what a good combat racing game feels like I feel that Mario Kart Double Dash is a dumbed down version of Mario Kart 64 I so much wanted it to be a great game It no longer has the hopping ability of the previous game For me it just wasn t very good Double Dash probably would be better for very young gamers as they would probably be more forgiving of its shortcomings 
As entertaining as any of Squaresoft s films This game came highly recommended by people who generally have similar taste in games as me but I m still trying to figure out why There s no question that the in game graphics are impressive and the story line is interesting However the gameplay is nearly non existant and when you do happen to participate in some of the action the controls are either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated i e the sphere grid or blitzball Even the story is often poorly told with stilted voices and hilariously bad character animation If I had to compare this game to some of Squaresoft s other efforts it is similar to a mix between Final Fantasy 8 and Chrono Cross But while those two games were generally frowned upon by RPG enthusiasts Final Fantsy X has recieved almost universal praise In short I m not so much disappointed with the game as I am baffled by its warm reception 
Stressful to the MAX I bought this game on a whim having really liked Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 This game needs help First of all the frame rate is lower than it should be There is slow down as well Even the game before this Need For Speed Underground 2 looked 100 times better The car models in Most Wanted are a touch nicer looking and there is a far better selection than Underground 2 but that s the only plus this game has to it You don t race as much as fly around the city in a barely controlled frenzy trying to stay ahead of the computer cars Winning is more by luck than skill He or she who hits the least obstacles wins Hardly an enjoyable way to race I get too stressed when playing this game so I put it away for a while Definitely rent before buying this game 
Pretty disappointing Crashes delays and usability problems I started with Caesar2 back when it came out I played it for hours and hours and loved it When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed Things have changed I m spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes Without trading you make little money and the game is essentially over Other problems I m seeing is overall performance I don t have the fastest machine AMD 2 1ghz 512ram rockin video card with 256meg of mem but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes I find the whole game to be difficult to use This was not the case with Caesar3 Unless they issue a patch I m done feel frustrated with crashes Maybe I can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays My suggestion Wait for a patch before buying or move on jason 
if i could ever get it to work Well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades I couldn t get the video to work at all couldn t get technical support at all and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions 
Frustration abounds As others have said this was a much anticipated game I played Caesar II and III and was extremely excited when I heard that IV was coming out What a letdown I didn t have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned and I haven t had the game crash on me However the game is unplayable on my system which is only a year old unless I turn down 90 of the advanced graphics By unplayable I mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse and when the game responds Even with the graphics turned down I still get lag when the auto save starts As mouse control is essential when building roads or aquaducts this is aggravating in the extreme It appears that Sierra s programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics Too bad I can t see them The interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution This means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge I much prefer the tabbed building interface of the other city building games Although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game which you couldn t in earlier versions the interface is not smart enough to auto rotate the buildings to fit along the roads You have to click and drag to rotate buildings and lag even at the low graphics settings can make this an exercise in frustration I dislike the new warehouse management panel The sliders might look cool but they re slow lag I would ve liked to see additional options for only store basic goods only store luxury goods etc This would take some of the pain out of managing them Trade ports are different also you can t see prices It appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance In the one I m playing right now I m stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 50 required to win I have over 30 000 denarii in my treasury and have been turning a hefty profit and meeting various demands from Rome for at least eight years of game time I have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory but prosperity continues to elude me My city is almost completely automated by now the only thing I do is respond to Rome s requests for goods or cash My advisors have nothing helpful to say It s not fun if I can t advance So while the game is pretty from what I can see of it it s got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time 
Beautiful but flawed and no support First thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 Caesar games out there Having said that this game had a major bug right at the release How is that possible Is it unreasonable to expect a U S company to produce a flawless product Probably not but Tilted Mill has some of the the best pros in the industry Basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess The advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer Far better to go with CivCity 3 
Poor execution This one turned out badly and I hate to say I bought it Buggy worse than normal it is a rough game The fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible The support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions Too bad I trusted PC Gamer s review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers Do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game 
Sid Say it ain t so Please Sid with the dissapointment of CivIV and now Railroads say you haven t jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers Sid the reason we purchase these games is because YOUR name is on them This game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who s grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games Please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards YOU created After this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account 
Disappointed This game is in such a sorry state that I don t even know where to begin First of all this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer Alas the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen Looks like Sid jumped in the easy fast and easy bandwagon Second the game is at best barely out of beta a little more useful and less destructive than say a computer virus I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks Finally be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen which interferes with other applications For instance the game won t launch while I run Skype Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer Shame on you Firaxis and Sid Meier 
The wait was not worth it I waited months for this game to come out I can t add anymore than what has been said by others I wonder how hands on Sid was with it Could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever 
er not good People I don t know what you see in this game It s not really a bad game it s just an average arcade shooter More often than not I can t even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly I pop out from behind something and I m dead meat Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game 
Don t buy if you have an LCD Rear Projection or Plasma TVs I d like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn t work on LCD televisions It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets 
Movie or game This so called game has a very good story and plot It keeps your attention by making you want to see what happens next However the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old Why you ask Because there is none You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need Oooooh there are multple endings Whoopee You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes This makes for a good movie but don t buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them 
To bad the XBox lasted only two months When I bought the XBox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don t feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months I can t say the person that sold me the XBox has even tried to email me since I ve emailed him hmmmm 
what a stupid attempt to a stupid game This game is horrible I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it I had wasted 5 bucks Its patheticic You cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay Pros Sunny can bite yay Cons Horrbiel graphics only 3 playable characters Bad humor Short cutscenes u cant do anything 1 path game hardly 3d seriously it doesnt look like it 
EGADS man Where for art thou Infinity Ward Man What s the f ing deal with companies handing over their biggest game franchises to second and third party developers Haven t they ever heard the old saying Dance with the one that brought you This game is horrible and if you say otherwise you re in bad need of therapy because you re so desperate for a video game that you ve convinced yourself this is worthy of your time Or maybe your time is truly that worthless in which case you should contemplate drastic measures First off the game is VERY linear Call of Duty 2 truly felt like an open battlefield whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful but how about those character animations The mouths aren t synched to the dialogue and they do that mindless hand waving thing when they talk just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64 The AI is horrible In Call of Duty 2 you couldn t just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him In this one you CAN but you just don t care to Also IT S GLITCHERIFFIC I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air completely off the top of the screen I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack the friggin dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards Mind you he was in the standing position the entire time Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard This game left a stale taste in my mouth and really just pissed me off Call of Duty 2 was 360 s only killer app If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack They could ve added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2 s campaign missions and I would ve paid 60 cash on the barrelhead son Way to go jacka es 
on every system ok most people have more then one system i have a PS2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version or should i go for the free copy i can download for the PS2 some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don 
What the hell Seriously I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet It was all I use to play online After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since Online play was non existent Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist It was ridiculus Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake This latest edition adds nothing to the series Do not purchase this game there are many better games out there 
You can t go wrong with Dawn of Sorrow Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow is the latest iteration of Konami s decades old franchise and the first to appear on the Nintendo DS Don t let the title fool you this really isn t the dawn of anything except maybe a bunch more Castlevania games on the DS And the subtitle here is simply a workable way to include the letters D and S in the title of the game as seems to be the requirement for the platform at this point Dawn of Sorrow actually takes place a year after the events in Aria of Sorrow which came out in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance If you ve played that game or if you ve played just about any recent Castlevania game actually you ll be right at home with Dawn of Sorrow because it s basically the same game repackaged to fit the DS That isn t a bad thing though because the Castlevania games have long carried the torch for good old fashioned 2D side scrolling gameplay and Dawn of Sorrow keeps that flame burning as bright as ever The star of Dawn of Sorrow is Soma Cruz the young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming the next Dracula in Aria of Sorrow Soma has the ability to collect the souls of monsters he kills thus inheriting their powers A year after Soma escaped Dracula s castle a mysterious woman named Celia shows up and attacks him Celia is a priestess of a new cult that is attempting to resurrect Dracula Since Soma already proved once before that he s capable of foiling the resurrection of the dark lord the cult decides to eliminate him before he can mess up their plans as well Soma survives the attack quite easily and Celia is forced to retreat Apparently Soma doesn t take kindly to people who try to kill him so he sets out to find Celia and prevent her from reviving Dracula The entire game takes place at the cult s base which is a replica of Dracula s castle In true Castlevania form you ll start off relatively weak with only a knife and some mediocre armor As you progress through areas of the castle you ll fight monsters and search the mazelike hallways where you ll gain experience as well as find new and better equipment As you gain experience you ll level up and your stats will increase in attack defense strength constitution intelligence and luck Throughout the game you ll also collect the souls of monsters you kill These souls can be equipped to give Soma new abilities There are three types of souls you can equip as well as ability type souls that grant you special powers without having to equip them Ability souls are collected when you defeat bosses and these abilities are usually required to progress through the game By using these ability souls Soma can learn how to double jump move underwater and break crystal blocks all of which are required to access certain areas of the castle Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow sticks close to the tried and true formula so it will be an instant hit with anyone with an affinity for the sort of explorative gameplay the series is known for While it doesn t do much to distinguish itself as the first Castlevania on the DS the updated look excellent music and added controls help to refine the series even further The bottom line is Whether you re familiar with the series or not you can t go wrong with Dawn of Sorrow 
Classic Castelvania The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania The sidescrolling platform action is spot on the graphics truly push the limits of the DS and the variety of equipment soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play As people have said in past reviews the use of the touch screen feels tacked on To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen which can be frustrating if a you have poor penmenship or b are left handed such as yours truly and have to scramble to take the stylus out switch it to your other hand and draw the symbol It s a neat little addition but again it didn t really need to be there Also the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy even in the later levels Don t get me wrong there are some that are just downright nasty but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go that s it Overall this is another great game for the Nintendo DS With the exception of the clunky touch screen addon the game is overall fantastic 
very fun game i really liked this game Im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game ALL THE TIME i dont why I WOULD BUY IT IF I WERE YOU VERY FUN CHALLENGING AT THE SAME TIME 
Incredible Incredibles I love this game My daughter and I are big Ratchet and Clank fans and look for games with similiar play We found that in the Incredibles game It s exciting and challenging As we get playing it I wonder if it is too easy at times but then I get to a spot that I can t accomplish until I do it 10 times My favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as Mr Incredible you then get to be Mrs Incredible Dash Violet etc Great fun 
Durable This mic is very durable and is wired good haven t had any problems and is much better than the headset 
Perfect for Karaoke Revolution If you re going to play Karaoke Revolution this is the mic for you I now have 2 so that my wife and I can play in duet mode It s much better than the headset For just 17 bucks you can have a real mic that feels so much more natural If you play KR a lot invest in this microphone 
Logitech Mic for PS2 I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2 The quality of the sound is awesome and my kids are having a blast with it The price is reasonable My kids take very good care of things but I m not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment I will probably end up buying another one 
A pretty good game clearly worth this price It has some flaws you will have to run around a bit between play areas but it plays well enough The price is right and it is worth the time you will spend on it The learning curve is small and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the CD if you look for them a neat extra It has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new though you do have a quot partner quot you can exploint during battle but it is a good change of sceenary I liked it enough to want to finish it I think you will too 
great game If you like Diablo 1 this is exactly the same game only improved 300 percent If not for Blizzards Bnet and all the multiplayer options I would say that this game is also better than Diablo 
Very nice game I m not a big fan of the Diablo D amp D typr game but this game is really neat The one big advantage of this game over Diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game Very high replay value also makes this game a winner Pick up a copy if you can I ve seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store For the price you can t go wrong 
Simply Amazing I just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars I had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox I ve been a PS2 fan for a while After I played the first couple of levels I was not dissapointed This game is simply amazing even today I can t possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out The gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics The sound and music to the game is awsome I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning 
Way way better than part 2 Halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time This is definately a good game to play if you ve never played a first person shooter Also if you have an Xbox you should get this because it is awesome Ratings Graphics Then 10 Now 7 Sound 10 Replayability 6 Controls 10 Drawn In Atmosphere 9 Fun 9 Multiplayer Co Op 9 Multiplay 
This is for the new slim PS2 Just so everyone knows I mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who wouldn t be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind And don t even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this 
Rented it liked it gonna buy it I rented Contact from GameFly and played it for a few days before deciding that I am going to purchase it in the not too distant future Unfortunately GameFly does not rent games along with instruction manuals so I had to learn everything in game by trial and error Even so I was doing pretty well if I do say so myself and had to stop myself from playing anymore so I wouldn t waste the purchase later It reminded me of other RPG type games I ve played in the past such as NES original Zelda If you liked Zelda you ll probably like this game But buy it or borrow from a friend who ll loan you the manual too To have that help may make all the difference 
for mod ers new package not version 2 This looked to be the new circuit board with flash ram and new modification options for the enthusiast The package was certainly new but the circuit board was the original version 1 You ll need to go to great lengths to make sure you re getting a version 2 if it s possible at all Good luck 
C64 30 Games in one Brings back the good old days of playing these games after school 
Episode II What Are You a Moron One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep II s battle system is annoying and ponderous because even in regular battles it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies This is actually a form of codespeak What these people are really saying is I m not very bright and even after several hours of playing Ep II I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently Ep II puts a great deal of emphasis on each character s attack attributes Attacks are classified as either Physical or Ether and then there are elementals fire ice lighting aura and finally there are types slash pierce hit Sound complicated Eh a little more so than the average RPG Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you re unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack When you come across enemies with Physical elemental weaknesses there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character s physical attack If their weakness is ether elemental then just use the standard elemental spell Ethers against them This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice normal pace For some reason the vast majority of Ep II players seemed to never realize this Instead they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine NINE turns in a row before beginning their attack Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters They took no heed of enemy weaknesses using characters with physical fire based attacks against enemies weak vs ether ice RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers I wonder what happened A lot of Ep I fans never bothered to play Ep II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released But now that Ep III is out and it s truly fantastic a lot of them will finally play Ep II soon I hope they do better than the first rounders did 
Xenosaga Episode 2 THIS PREVIEW HAS SPOILERS OF THE GAME PLEASE DON T READ IT IF YOU DIDN T PLAY IT I played Xenogears and when i saw Xenosaga Episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an introduction OK improvements Gameplay was Longer than Episode 1 I ended Episode 1 with everything in 42 hours in change Ep2 88+ Sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways The Idea of Epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that Chaos Jr Momo Shion Kosmos Looking was improved they looked more grow up Battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double Tech attacks All Characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests Momo Bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good Damage Dealer Recover Mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble People complain because history was focus in Jr and URTVs but the title says itself Jenseits von Gut und B se means Beyond Good and Evil wich means Rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his Red Dragon mode wich makes him go out of control possible reason of Sakura Death Albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well Nigredo wich refused to do a mission involved with Rubedo and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said Giving life from 1 hand and delivering death from the other Honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going What they did wrong I don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea Good Thing they added the tech attacks special attacks in ep 3 You had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters wich made battles kinda boring Music in battle was kinda boring compare to Ep 1 Voices of Chaos sounded boring Kos Mos like Fake silly girl trying to play as a robot Shion Pushing and like I m better than you Momo Very Annoying sad thing is my main team is Chaos Kosmos Momo thats why i got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode 1 in the third and last episode Ep 1 has almost 8 hours of movies Ep 2 4 30hours i guess for the complains of the long movies I still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things Xenosaga has over most of the games In Episode 3 is 4hours of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like Valkyrie Profile They cut completly the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting they fix that in ep3 In Resume as everyone know Episode 2 had bad things but as well good things as every game no they shouldn t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself Good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of Episode 2 to Episode 3 Battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing i didn t like of episode 3 battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system attack ether tech special tech and others so forget the 4 combinations to make a tech attacks ethers cost ep cp special attacks cost boosts i wonder if attack will give some ep cp later Even with all this i recommend you to buy it before you get episode 3 because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost 20 dollars each or less Atte Roy_Master 
Highs and Lows While I think some of the reviews of Xenosaga II are a little harsh they have hit on a few good points In terms of plot the first thing that really let me down was KOS MOS Don t let her face covering the cover of the game fool you While being one of the main characters in the first game she hardly does ANYTHING in this game until the end which seems less like a plot point and more of the creators obliging her The same can be said for Shion as well This shift from center stage hurts these characters and it s really disappointing Instead Jr takes center stage Instead of shedding light on events in the first game it opens up a whole knew set of issues that really don t get resolved If you re looking for the story pull that the first game had it ll be hard to find in this game Jr is a character that I personally don t care much about but if you are a fan of him then you ll enjoy this game as you learn a lot about his past as a U R T V A new character that is introduced is Shion s brother Jin Uzuki Personally I liked Jin but you don t get to use him much in the game With him Shion Jr and Albedo there is an underlying theme of brothers or siblings in the story although don t look for much elaboration on Jin and Shion Although some people aren t pleased with the battle system in this game I actually enjoyed it I caught into it quicker than the first game s system You can also acquire a skill that points out the enemies weak zones which I found very useful I also liked being able to build up attacks and then boost to really slam the enemy Overall it s a game I really enjoyed The game has some replay value to it and there are certain things that you actually can t accomplish UNTIL you ve beaten the game once At times re watching certain scenes over and over again gets boring Yet I would recommend this series as if nothing else it serves as a bridge between the first game and the upcoming third game 
Best car game ever This is THE GAME for race lovers awesome graphics car responce is just like the real thing photo lab is very nice too you can take pics of your rides you will never get bored of this game A must have 
Exelente Really it is a good game on war buy it since it he is very goo 
works well Used this product to softmod my xbox Had to download an older version of the software though If you just use it to cheat in games probably not worth the money 
Question Can you use the Action Relpay on ur Xbox for multiplayergames like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo because that is the only reason why i want to use this product is so that i can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload i would want invinsibility but then it would be obvious that i was cheatin and when u read that u probablly thought well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo but still i would like to know this before i buy it i will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do 
This game rocks Yes I am a die hard Star Wars fan and yes I love a good mission based action game so man if this isn t the perfect game for me It s so much fun and there s so much freedom in the game in itself Add on to that the space missions and Wow this game totally blows me away Highly recommended for anyone who is a Star Wars fan a FPS fan or a fan of fun gameplay 
experienced gamer I ve had this game since it first came out and I am still not sick of it I think anyone that enjoys the Halo multiplayer would enjoy this game Lucasarts improved just about everything you can think of from the first Battlefront The story mode and galactic conquest strategy mode are excellent additions to the basic Battlefront where you simply take over bases and kill the enemy but thank goodness they still kept that in this game I do miss some of the old scenarios but a lot of the new scenarios are really good and the new controls make Battlefront II totally worth playing I love the improved controls new characters and the new space battles The ability to sprint is an ingenious addition In most games you can walk or run In this game the characters have the ability to run very fast by sprinting They can also kneel lay dive and roll I hope all future action games adopt this I do wish the characters had the ability to punch someone after all they can do just about everything else The ability to change your character at bases you control is a nice addition Engineers with the ability to repair things or take over occupied enemy vehicles is great There is a nice array of weapons and the ability to play as specialized characters such as Darth Vader or Boba Fett is awesome The space battles are really fun except when you board the enemy ship there is only limited areas that you have access to The graphics are great in HD Pros Controls ability to sprint change characters at bases engineers that repair things and steal enemy vehicles graphics multiple scenarios a lot of characters play as specialty characters jedi space battles multiple playing options strategy mode story mode and basic Battlefront mode Cons characters don t have the ability to punch someone boarding an enemy ship in a space battle has very limited access to the enemy ship Some of the fun scenarios from the first Battlefront are not in this one The option of flying multiple ships playing multiple characters using turrets in both space battles and regular battles and all of the multiple things your characters can do make this game worth playing 
this game is awesome i have been playing the madden series since i was a kid and this game is really good the games just keep getting better and better as each year passes everything in this game is worth the money i strongly reccommend it 
Great in most ways but not worth 40 dollars I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version then dont bother updating as you may not notice many of the updates upgrades Is this an awesome game Yes but it has a few holes even still 1 Too much sacking on your QB by the cpu 2 The CPU will run the ball so darn often it is a joke 3 The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often 4 If you want to play on all madden level you are FORCED to play with QB vision on which we all know stinks Basically they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match ups assignments etc Also the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well What about this game is really good Well it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm it is an easy way to dominate the game BTW the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two now I am making 90 FG s easily You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well The rosters are also accurate but personally if you own madden 06 wait 4 6 more weeks and then buy this one for 19 as a PS2 best of game 
physicus it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there Some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve Other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline 
Final Fantasy IX This game is a great one I enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or a good RPG 
sleeping giant This is perhaps the best of the Final Fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated IX had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay The characters are some of the most delightful in the series Personally I think Vivi and Zidane are the coolest characters ever Lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline On a sidenote This game definitely deserves a remake There s a lot of hype about final fantasy VII its own prequel and a remake coming for PS3 I feel that Final Fantasy IX should be remade on the PS3 I love the story line better than VII the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible 
Amazon is it Quick delivery Product arrived on time and in excellent condition You have quality shipping Thank yo 
R Angus i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i don t think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun 
Square if this isn t one of the greatest games out there it s the best We ve all heard of Final Fantasy 8 and Final Fantasy 10 but does anyone ever mention the game in between Final Fantasy 9 is sadly the most underestimated game in the Final Fantasy series It s the one that pulled me into my FF fandom and though it s around 6 years old I still love it The reason it s not as famous as the others is probably because FF9 came out on the Playstation JUST before the Playstation 2 came out The storyline is spellbinding It captures you right at the beginning and flows beautifully through cities of eternal rain clashing monsters and the Traditional plot theme in almost every RPG alive fate of the world itself Everyone can relate to FF9 s characters who struggle to find who they are or where they belong and in the end find or almost find the meaning in a stunning finale Then you ll find yourself cheering for them or mourning over them if you become attached to one who dies The music Nobuo you ve outdone yourself FF9 s songs are masterpieces and you ll find yourself humming YOU RE NOT ALONE or MELODIES OF LIFE without knowing it And of course a couple pieces will bring back amusing scenes just by mentioning their name SLEW OF LOVE LETTERS anyone Any cons Hard question If there were a problem then I can t target it Perhaps leveling up your character may take a while but then again that s a traditional part of every FF Game so it shouldn t be counted And being able to play as a few of the legendary characters Fratley Beatrix would be great but that would take away their status wouldn t it And that s an opinion so I ll let it slide I can think about this until my head explodes but I won t be able to target an ACTUAL flaw I Lyrit find Final Fantasy 9 the perfect RPG game Overall and again this has got to be the greatest FF game out there I ve played most of the others popular in the series now but they just don t strike me like FF9 Wait What are you listening to ME for GET FF9 AND PLAY IT Once you do my review will look like it s degrading this game 
My girls groove It was a great game that can include your whole family or entertain people at a party Sometimes when you have a lot of people over you can even have a dance party Overall its a great game and I recommend you buy it 
excellent fun for all ages If you already have an Eye Toy and your favorite game on it is Beat Freak then you have to get Eye Toy Groove The 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from Elvis to Good Charlotte As a 46 year old woman I got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in This is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 Even the preschoolers I occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than I can say for Dance Dance Revolution 
Great game but do not expect another Hour of Darkness That might be a little misleading the battle mechanics are almost exactly the same as those in the first game heck as in most of Nippon Ichi s games though this series I think is the best of the lot That part of the game absolutely delivers Great classes Good monsters and a more consistent class sytem for them Excellent assortment of items Good variety of levels However as far as the story an area in which Hour of Darkness was solid this game falls on its face The writing is iffy the plot itself is contrived the characters while certainly amusing are predictable and it just leaves so much to be desired If you re looking for a storyline you can get involved in go back to the first game If you re in it for the gameplay though don t miss this one With some class tweaks and a few added features Cursed Memories is a worthy addition for those who simply want the monotonous level up madness that some of us thrive on Great 2D art mixed with fun environments HILARIOUS quips and item descriptions engaging fights and hundreds of hours literally of entertainment 
Better than the first Disgaea If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer ninja etc much quicker The main characters are still hilarious and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl Etna and the gang again in this one Go Prism Rangers = Once again the plot isn t too twisted but it is enjoyable Back to the game play though its similar to the old one but you have more options For one you can JOIN the Dark Assembly In the item world you can not only level your item but go to an assembly improve the luck of your item and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence the assembly There is also the new addition of the subpoena These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders too much hp etc etc These are medals of honor in the demon world and allow your characters more prestige not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world Another bonus you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item so you can get a felony charge and level your item at the same time This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer s collection and I highly recommend it Enjoy 
More of the same and that s a good thing I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea As such I will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note Having said that let s begin The game begins in the land of Veldime an alternate world from that of the first game where an evil Overlord named Zenon has hidden from well everyone When he came into Veldime however he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons The effects weren t all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon there will be no turning back Thus the hero Adell oddly enough the only person unaffected by Zenon s curse sets out to defeat the Overlord In the opening there is an attempt to summon Zenon to Adell so he can fight him but it goes awry and Zenon s daughter accidentally gets summoned instead Bound to Adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father albeit not without scheming a bit herself In a nutshell the story is good Nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original The only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do Stack Attacks and if you are quick enough throw diagnally The basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack In doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground Essentially a team attack of up to 10 characters There have been updates to the Dark Assembly with 6 factions of Senators being introduced And it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk random vote basically or even asleep no vote at all Perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies You can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling having to much hp sp mana or even killing your own allies The benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get it is easier to pass proposals at the Dark Assembly and for every felony on a character they gain 1 extra exp This works all the way up to 300 felonies 300 exp bonus The game has made all the necessary additions to make the gameplay top that of the original however in my opinion there feels like something is missing The characters seem a bit more by the book and not as wonderfully absurd as the original That and the voice acting isn t quite as good as the that of the first Disgaea plus Etna has a new voice actress Despite all of that however the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot All in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game While some may like the changes in the characters and others may not there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long if not longer 
Final Fantasy XII I bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact I haven t heard any noise he is to busy playing it 
RPG or Final Fantasy fans good Shooter FPS fans bad Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off aside PSP s Crisis Core and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world The game seems like a must play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike and it is Thinking most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs this game is relatively easier than popular FPS shooters like Halo Being an RPG fan yet still wanting to learn the story of the game I was very happy for the easy difficulty though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode The controls are a little bad but nothing that someone can t get used to For one of Square s second or third shooter games this one is pretty good I d recommend if you re doing what I did and playing it for story then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them you never have to get them again The guide is actually pretty good for this game as well as the soundtrack If you re a fan of the Final Fantasy music definitely pick the soundtrack up Lastly if you re a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan get this game and everything related to it It s worth it I couldn t put this game down even if some characters are a bit under developed If you re a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed 
Great Controller This controller feels great in your hands In fact after using this controller for awhile my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands The response of the controller is good I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time One down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year 
Seven Months I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them The problem is the same every time the left analog stick breaks My girlfriend got me my first one in December 2004 Christmas It lasted until about July 2005 I exchanged it at the store and the new one lasted until maybe February 2006 I exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in September 2006 I am not really a heavy gamer I play Madden and NCAA 2007 sparingly I am very disappointed with this repeat problem I also notice the X button sticking issue that others refer to here I tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick That seemed to work for a while You really can t beat the convenience of wireless and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability 
great device but I have the same opinion as everyone else the controller is very convenient appealing affordable and fun but it suddenly stopped working i think there are some problems with the wireless connection and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and BOOM your controller stops respondind and you get killed IT SUCKS i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do what i do to solve it is changing the batteries and then putting them back again or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again that has worked for me it sounds silly but somehow works so if you want a great wireless controller this is it but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too 
Gamers everywhere can finally rejoice in knowing that wireless controllers aren t doomed after all I ve never bought a wireless controller before so I wasn t sure what to expect But it turns out this is probably the most comfortable video game controller in the world the Logitech Wireless PS2 Action Controller is every bit as comfortable as the DualShock 2 and then some It s a very curvy controller that fits almost too perfectly into the palms of your hands and the buttons are placed great The buttons never noticeably stick the full D Pad is Hundreds of times better than Sony s segmented D Pad and the analog sticks are EXTREMELY sensitive responding to the lightest touch and there are the start select analog buttons there 9though analog is called Mode on this controller and a new button that turns vibration on or off The placement of these four is good enough as you won t be using them often anyways Lag time is wonderful for this controller There is NO noticeable lag whatsoever The radio frequency causes NO interference and the reciever is small and barely noticable if not a bit dare I say it cute The controller s weight is excellent too It runs on batteries yet is unbelievably light The battery door does not stick out on the back uncomfortably either Your batteries will also last you from 50 300 hours with vibration on off You won t even know you re playing with it when you re in the middle of a violent gunfight somewhere It s just that good The size is also comfortable and barely larger than the DualShock 2 Plus there are no cords to trip over pull out of the controller slot or add to the mess of cords behind your entertainment center There is ONE small bad point about this The vbration feature is not as good as the DualShock s But there are just TOO MANY good things here about this controller that make it invaluable to buy even with this minor drawback The Verdict Guilty on the charges of being The most invaluable piece of PS2 hardware aside from the console itself in the world Sentenced to be bought by consumers around the world Case dismissed 
Best cordless controller for ANY system From using only two cordless controllers this one and the XBox 360 s controller I like this one a LOT more It s comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light I couldn t ask for a better controller unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then I d find myself that much more pleased Buy this one there isn t a better wireless controller out there 
Totally Different I came upon this game as a demo from SONY I downloaded it onto my PSP and was hooked within 5 minutes I needed to have the full game Don t let the child like voices and images steer you clear of this game if you are an older gamer Trust me you will have some fun The only thing is I did beat it a little too fast Still very fun 
LocoRoco Best PSP Game Clearly a Hit At TGS Tokyo Game Show 2005 Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP LocoRoco Instead of the usual ports or re creations or compliations of retro games LocoRoco is a completely new venture It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos yellow blobs and MuiMuis blue figures live One day it is invaded by the Moja Troop who eat LocoRoco Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten You collect flowers which gives you another LocoRoco You can combine and separate LocoRocos as well You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos Additionally when you collect MuiMuis you can get house parts The game is very easy As a PSP player of Tekken DR complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play especially ports that we re used to seeing on PSOne and PS2 With LocoRoco you use 3 buttons during gameplay The shoulder buttons LEFT and RIGHT are used to tilt tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos holding the circle button combines them and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump A lot easier said than done A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http www us playstation com locorocopcdemo You must have v2 71 for this to work I might add Besides a career mode which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos there are mini games like a Mui Mui Crane Chuppa game and more You must collect a certain amount of bugs pickories every game to play these games Also there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco I haven t yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature I presume By collecting MuiMuis in games you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco Besides all of the gameplay features a large soundtrack is full of bubbly interesting and catchy jingles with unique voices While some find it annoying it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on MuiMuis do as well The graphics are 2D like Mario which make loading times non existant and shows off the capability of the PSP s high performance graphics In the end LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive simple and beautiful to look at It is fitted only for the PSP and it should Additionally the gameplay is excellent pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters like Moja who attack you or Chuppa who catapults you into hidden areas It is clearly worth 40 clearly PROS Intuitiveness and Simplicity Easy to play fitted for the PSP Shows off PSP Graphic Capabilities Beautiful to look at Different Maps Characters Colors Very unique and fresh Not a Port or Re creation compliation A completely original game No Long Loading Times 2D graphics prevents this Mini Games Lets you take a break from main gameplay CONS Longevity Only 40 levels makes you wish for more Should ve Used Characters More Some characters pop up once You have to pay money made in career to access mini games 5 5 FUN 5 5 GRAPHICS 5 5 GAMEPLAY 4 5 PLAYABILITY 19 20 TOTA 
Xbox Controller S This is a great controller Especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky Personally speaking I never really had problems with even that But since I got Xbox Controller S I havent touched the big one This controller gives a better grip buttons are softer and their positioning is better the overall feel is quite good I played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game Even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully master the tracks I did it without any problems using this controller Also the vibration feel is very good So if you are looking to buy an Xbox controller and are not being able to decide which just go for this smaller one Controller S without any hesitation Quality hardware 
Best Controller Yet This controller is great You are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest This controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus 
Xenosaga series I ve played them all and enjoyed them all Sorry this was the last one 
Dualshock controller I ve only had this controller for a few days and I have found that the layout is the same as the black controller I do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game 
it s a controller In case you havent noticed this is a controller not a game So as far as the controller goes it works great and I have not had a single problem with it 
It is not a false advertisement It is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the Playstation 2 that have a built in IR receiver which is why it doesn t include it 
Finally Fantasy Fun Ok I did not review any of the other comments on this game before posting this I have been playing Final Fantasy games for a very long time I still have and play p Mystic Quest Final Fantasy II and FF III for SNES FF XII is the BEST Final Fantasy since 3 US in my opinion and it is FUN The story line is AWESOME kinda like Shakespeare meets King Arthur and it reminds me a bit of final fantasy 3 only with awesome graphics My one peeve for all of the games was leveling up HP and MP I felt like after I mastered the new way of doing it they changed it for the next game The old games did it automatically after those you had to equip things in order to gain strength magic and special abilities This game combines what you have already learned from FF VII on and if you have never played the game there is a great tutorial that you can access at any time This game is just plain FUN I think the MOST fun since FF III You have the freedom to explore and wander without getting lost there is a reminder at the bottom of the map and X s to show you where to go you can see whatever you come into contcact with friends and foes and the storyline and gameplay are phenomenal 
THE BEST GAMEPLAY IS FINAL FANTASY SERIES I finished almost all final fantasy games FF1 10 10 2 FF Tactics I would say that this FF XII is the best gameplay in final fantasy I ever dream off since my childhood I will summarize as follows 1 Game play I would rate this 10 stars but here the max is just 5 The game looks boring at first but once you get a party and the A I system called Gambit in the game this is extremely fun The battle environment is superb Looks much like real battle No battle scene No random battle Everything appears on the map Multiple attacks can land on the enemy at the same time The camera view is half global you can see everything if there is no obstacle from front behing left right and above not below though since the floor is an obstacle THIS IS LIKE THE REAL THING THE THING I WANT TO SEE IN FINAL FANTASY 2 Graphic superb The rendered texture looks inferior to FF X and FF X 2 when these two have the highest quality of the cutscene displayed But the over all cut scene is better since in FF X and X 2 there are sometimes that the cutscene looks really bad I am more satisfied to something that is smoothly good on average not too good cutscene and then extremely bad at times 3 Music Superb Thus far no normal battle music but that does not matter The music is not so great when you listen separately but it suits the game environment a lot 4 Trivia the town is so huge Look like the real town Approximately more than 50 100 people you can talk with in each town The costume looks so different It is not just like the old series of this game where the town person in town A may looks exactly alike that in another town if you notice But in FF XII you have to notice meticulously to see that similarity Overall everyone looks unique Another thing I would say that the environment looks much like STAR WARS + LORD OF THE RINGS though I put more emphasis on the former If you watch STAR WARS Episode I you will see why I think it looks much like STAR WARS Cons I would say that these cons is nothing compared to the pros 1 Storyline Quite simple No plot twist thus fat I have played Not many things stimulate the players to want to know what will happen next Unlike FFX that game introduced many interesting plots from the beginning and gradually unraveled them as the game proceeded I would say that if you were to watch only the movies and the cutscene FFXII sounds like a normal battle story in the middle age But why there are so many hi tech transportation 2 Voice I would say that the voice actors in this game is quite disappointing They did the good job I admitted but their voices doesn t seem to sound good For example compared to FF X the main female protagonist has the unique voice but that in FF XII sounds like typical american people The second main female protagonist in FF X sounds unique but that in FFXII sounds ok not so great The main antagonist in FF X sounds mysteriously great but that in FFXII sounds quite dull The only one that I think he sounds ok is the main male protagonist 
Great I will try to keep this brief by the way I m only 10 hrs thru only just got out of City 1 Rabernastre Dalmasca and now in city 2 Bahjerba sp Quickly my first impressions of the game were strange I was like MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing but after maybe 20 min of getting of the wierdness it really sucks you in Ughh I really wish I didn t have midterms coming up so I could go home and play Pros Love the battle system It s still strategy but it doesn t require you to have random battles ughh I d hate the whzzzhhh of the starting of random battles I can still feel in control but doing less actual work Like everyone else says CG always good Story though not as much character development focus as previous ones I do like the whole war polity centered plot It does follow FFT s tradition I actually like the license board some people have said it s a pain in the beginning but so far it hasn t been the case for me granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit 40 min or so You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to don t randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING Plan plan plan Right now by the way I m constructing my chars in the way the game hints at its only one way to do it but first time around I ll follow it the already licensed equipment abilities hint at what they ll be good at HUGE game Lots of stuff to see and quite beautiful Character design course there is always someone to love Har har har as a fangirl I must say I love Basch D lol tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced He looks like a kid haha I m a college student and such a fangirl haha sad isn t it If I were a guy I d say I d like Fran the most this is of course subject to personal opinion I like subs and I like how they are not bland they have fancy font this time D Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor Makes the game really movie ish Widescreen capability Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not I also like that Free moving camera Thank heaven for that I LOVE it I hated the still camera immensely in FFX Cute monsters lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them Cons HUGE game yes also a con lots of time running around Good thing all the characters don t run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX Meh neutral Voices I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF s voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones The prev FF s voice actors were okay but not great Here the voice actors are really good but the choice of some of them seems strange like I have a problem with Fran s voice it was a strange choice and a strange voice Also Balthier s voice doesn t seem to go with his look but I really do like the voice acting by itself In sum some voices though really well acted didn t seem to fit the actor s look however I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well matched roles so I give the voice acting a mild thumbs up After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations I feel I must also address that As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard Marquis pronounced both as Markus and Marquis rather than Markee I also did twitch when they pronounced fete as feet rather than feh t Soundtrack I liked all the music there was a lot taken from FFT esp the battle music in the Estersand I think it is totally taken from FFT obviously as both take place in the same world I did enjoy the non midi renditions of the themes but the rest of the new guy s music was just meh wasn t particularly bad but it didn t really stand out much either 
Overall a great game but with a few additions I could do without The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games With creation of GTA 3 games became increasingly more violent and more controversal San Andreas is no exception If this game did not bear the GTA tag I probably would have rated it higher but needless to say I m a bit disappointed with what rockstar did with this addition to the GTA series Previous GTAs all had a quirky jab at political and social icons particularly conversation political and social icons San Andreas had this but to a much lesser extent which disappointed me Another thing which disappointed me about this game was the RPG like system they put into it Your accuracy is determined by how often you practice rather than the players ablity to shoot Also unlike previous GTAs you must now press a button and slow your walking speed down to manually aim and fire a gun I HATED this change in the gameplay This severely limits your ablity to go on rampages and forces you to use their god awful auto aim system If they had not added this function to the game I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more That being said there were PLENTY of things I enjoyed about this game First off I enjoyed the new depth theyve added to missions Previously missions were as followed Kill this blow up that run way from these guys and avoid cops Missions in this game actually feel like Rockstar put a lot of time into each individual objective One Mission that particularly comes to mind is the mission where you hop on a plane have a small shootout on the INSIDE of the vehicle then fly to liberty cities a location that you cannot travel to normally and assassinate some crime bosses Little things like this show the extra effort the designers put into the game Another thing I enjoyed about this game is that it is more challengeing than previous GTAs The very last mission will have you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing from the firetruck missions This game is designed at a skill level for someone who has been playing GTA a long time Also the map is friggin huge Its about 3 times the size of your regular GTA game However unlike previous GTAs its not packed with little goodies and have special jumps at every corner Its still fun to explore every corner of the map in this game though So now for the break down of my review Pros Incredibly large map Challengeing More new vehicles to hijack An overall improvement on the missions Plenty of extra features GANG WARS Good voice acting The Cons New style of shooting is a huge hinderance Areas are not as packed with goodies as before Fewer political cheap shots than SA s predcisours Overall I would give this game a 8 out of 10 in comparison to video games everywhere but only 4 out of 10 when compared to its predecesors 5 being average One other note If you have an ATI Radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game not with lag but with actually loading the game 
here is somethin you can t understand Not really being into the original GTA III and its birds eye view predecessors I became unfortunately addicted to to San Andreas The game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are despite the dated graphics engaging Maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations The game play is free ranging but if you don t pursue the main storyline missions which are linear but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with as it should be The moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions but for the most part there are repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so My criticism would be that there are not enough repurcussions for street violence because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging If you go on a rampage in a local store the clerks don t try to call the police or evade They instead just take a beating or a bullet The AI of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street The cops in San Andreas are corrupt but not that corrupt GTA SA definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for PC Some of the interface and in game menus are awkward and designed to be PS2 gamepad friendly Saving the game is a bit of a pain as well since you have to retreat to your safe house to save everytime A fun and engrossing game for adults but let this be known if you let your under 18 child play this game you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away Aside from the violence San Andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo and is probably not really suitable for anyone under 40 There is no safe mode or low gore level for this game like some other titles while the game is overly violent gore is minimal anyway 
Same GTA with some RPG touches As one might suspect GTA San Adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving guns galore and a lawless protagonist and a linear storyline Let s be honest though nobody buys GTA to JUST play the mission part and in fact I have a hard time getting into the missions In San Andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game unless you want to cheat The clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay Haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase You have various parts of your character that can be built up fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc Obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry The others are self explanatory Some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game The hydra which is a harrier type jet the stunt plane an attack helicopter a four wheeler a parachute and my favorite the jetpack Other than that the game is like each created before it from GTA 3 on The graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired Whatever engine they use is clearly the same as GTA 3 Animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic Music from the radio stations is lackluster but I believe it is possible to use your own music instead As a computer game San Adreas controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done In the worst case scenario the hydra however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking If you want to shoot something below you be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction I myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the USB port on the computer Even with that it is not much better and you still need the D pad to make decent turns As you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game Overall Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has a lot to offer if you don t have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls I would rate it a 7 out of 10 
Rockstar continues to move its biggest franchise forward at a steady pace with this the sixth incarnation of the GTA series The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas all within the enormous state of San Andreas The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90 s This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character s appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly The character s skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early 90s in California The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits expensive jewelry and trendy fashions Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos his physical fitness can also be changed The Grand Theft Auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different As the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess The graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time Nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill San Andreas in an orange tint and the game s color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties California culture The soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which San Andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that Rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music The expected genres can be found such as Hip Hop and Alternative Rock both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene However some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world s era Dance music and Funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it although too much choice is never a bad thing Making a welcomed return are the various radio station DJs who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations For those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format one public station holding discussions on the day s political events and another with light talk shows Either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the PC version gives you the added bonus of playing your own MP3 tracks by adding them to the game s music library The sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive There is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride All these things add a little bit of life to the game s large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that San Andreas contains The thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present The gunfire and explosions sound average with not much improvement present since Vice City Despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series San Andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself An engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect 
Good Product It works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original A V Cables 
Component Cable This is a great cable for your HD TV while playing you Sony Playstation 2 It give very crisp and clear images much better than the cable that comes with the playstation 
Great but I did find one thing These Component AV cables make a world of difference in video quality Especially on HDTV Some Images now appear pixelated this may be the game I am playing But everything else is smooth crisp and clear Text is three times as easy to read I reccomend these for any HDTV owner 
wow At first playing a Star Wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks This game is incredible It is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it Buy this game and put your blasters on full 
A Must Have For Fans There is no denying that Star Wars Battlefront is one of the best video game series that is currently available The first game was really amazing let us participate in some of the places seen in all six movies But even though the game was really fun it felt like there was something still missing The missing piece was put in and this is the result This is not a disappoinment but the best Unlike the first game when the main story gameplay was just caputring bases and killing all of the enemy forces here there are actually missions to complete From having to retrieve data discs to killing rebel leaders this game is more indepth than it s predecessor In game there are still times when bases have to be captured like in the first game but you no longer have to kill all of the enemies The coolest part of the game is that you get to ride in different ships and other things from the movies Lots of fun So overall this game really is an improvement over the first but some may prefer the first more The reason being that the first game is basically kill everyone and take their bases and that is less seen here with the focus is more on protecting things and stealing things 
StarWars Battlefront II warning very addictive This is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title When you re flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms you begin to realize this game is really special 
One of the BEST GAMES EVER This game is really good Theres a wide varity of lvls to play and a very good multyplayer system The game only has a few faults like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship The game also gets a little boring after a while Besides that its a great game 
Play as jedis Yoda Obi Wan Darth Vader General Grevious and Ki Adi Mundi In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the Republic s side And you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier And you have the opportunity to do instant action That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as Also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it s really boring This game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile So get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen Also Yoda is awesome 
GREAT ENTERTAINMENT I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LOVES TO SING I DIDN T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE SO FUN THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD JOIN IN AND PLAY FOR HOURS IT WAS SO FUN THAT WE IMMEDIATELY HAD TO BUY THE KAREOKE CMT COUNTRY GAME ALSO 
Karaoke Revolution Rocks This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining I suggest this game for everybody 
Fun For All Ages I bought this game for an adult birthday party It was a hit The game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game You have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc You can also change the mode to the traditional Karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen It s definitely for all ages even my two year old can t get enough of it The selection of music is good Be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes 
A ton of fun but aimed at the older crowd perhaps This was the first karaoke revolution game that I received and I enjoy it very much However the songs on the game I found were quite old even for someone like myself a senior in college I dont know about the rest of you but the 80 s were a blur for me I didnt know these songs very well which can put a major hinderance on game play I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know I found the sing and dance mode to be challenging and if you dont know the song by heart dont play it because you need to be watching the arrows for where your feet should be going I would also recommend a wireless microphone for the dance pad if they exist since a cord will get in the way of your dancing moves I thought it was really cool that the game had a sense of initiative with over 50 different unlockable items although 90 of which are items you can use to create your character or just a new character Some of the songs listed here need to be unlocked through game play I m sorry I couldnt think of every artist for these songs but if it isnt listed assume its from at least 15 years ago 1 I ve Had the Time of My Life 2 You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman Aretha Franklin 3 Ain t Nothing Like the Real Thing 4 Always 5 American Woman Lenny Kravitz 6 Brick House 7 Call Me 8 Crazy Aerosmith 9 Crazy In Love Beyonce 10 Do you Really Want to Hurt Me Boy George 11 Drive Incubus 12 Dust in the Wind 13 Endless Love Lionel Richie 14 Every Little Thing She Does is Magic 15 Everybody Wants to Rule the World 16 Everywhere Michelle Branch 17 Fame 18 Fly Hilary Duff 19 For You I Will Monica 20 Greatest Love of All Whitney Houston 21 Headstrong 22 Here I Go Again Whitesnake 23 I Dont Want to Be Gavin DeGraw 24 I Left My Heart in San Francisco 25 I Love Rock and Roll Joan Jett 26 I Will Always Love You Whitney Houston 27 If You Could Only See 28 I ll Be Edwin McCain 29 Material Girl Madonna 30 Me and Bobby McGee 31 Pain 32 Pieces of Me Ashlee Simpson 33 Play That Funky Music 34 Start Me Up Rolling Stones 35 Superstition Stevie Wonder 36 Sweet Caroline Neil Diamond 37 Takin Care of Business Bachman Turner Overdrive 38 That s Amore 39 The Game of Love Michelle Branch 40 Time After Time 41 Truth Is Recent but I dont know by who 42 Turn the Beat Around Miami Sound Machine 43 Unforgettable 44 Uptown Girl Billy Joel 45 Waiting For a Girl Like You 46 What I Like About You 47 Who Can It Be Now 48 You re My Best Friend 49 Take on Me 
The Best Yet I don t know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough We plugged it in on Christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since The selection of songs is excellent The sing and dance feature brings sends this game WAY out in front of earlier editions which we also have The eye toy is a good addition Just everything about it is first rate I can t think of a single drawback My only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family PARENTS TOO 
Got a vacation coming Good You re going to be obsessed with this game This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful positive entrancing funny inventive has a great soundtrack and doesn t involve violence carnage I m 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks My 6 year old son was equally engaged and was able to complete about 40 of it without help himself he needed help with boss battles or anything under time pressure You can lose hours to this game but you won t emerge with tense sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks At the same time it is definately not too easy It s just challenging enough And it s long thank goodness because I didn t want it to end The overall tone is so positive You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world You have weapons and you do take out monsters but your weapon is a ink brush and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes Simply brilliant and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover 
I LOVE this game But there are some problems with it I can t get enough of Okami I ve beaten it and am started on a second play though Any action RPG game fan has to at least try this game The title basically says it all It is a typically Japanese play on words since depending on how you translate it Okami can mean either wolf or king of the gods For those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game here are the basics 100 years before the game s beginning a huge 8 headed dragon monster called the Orochi menaced the small village of Kamiki After suffering Orochi s tyranny for years the village s champion Nagi and a white wolf the village dubbed Shiranui defeated the Orochi Shiranui died from his wounds after the fight and the village built a shrine for him Peace reigned for 100 years until the evil suddenly and mysteriously reappeared You control Shiranui reborn in a quest to save the land from the evil You travel all over the land of Nippon which is Japanese for Japan how original fighting monsters helping people and healing nature of the curse of evil The story is nothing new and is both very linear and quite predictable But it is very well done mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor The story has one major downside though it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket loads of exposition You will often find yourself button mashing X desperately to try to speed things along and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes don t let you speed up the dialogue For instance the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action Most of the rest are not nearly that long but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least To say that it gets tedious is an understatement Still the cell shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes They are done in a very beautiful yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional Japanese ink painting Despite the simple style though the level of detail is outstanding In fact it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown This game really pushes the hardware of the PS2 to its limits The music and sound are also fantastic Most of the music evokes traditional Japanese art as much as the graphics do while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees and more The mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you re visiting Except possibly with the voices Rather than real voices people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater While it does not bother me personally some people simply can not listen to these voice effects Either you ll hate the voice noises with a passion or you won t care at all Either way this is not a good point for the game The controls take a bit of getting used to but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature Unlike the Legend of Zelda games there is no enemy lock on during combat Instead you automatically target the closest monster s when you push the attack button This simplifies combat without turning it into a button mashing cake walk It works perfectly unless you get hit by the controller bug Yes a bug in the game Thankfully rare as I only encountered it twice in 60+ hours of game play Still when it happens it is extremely annoying During combat while you re wailing away on a monster the options menu will suddenly open for no reason Usually the analog control on your controller will also go crazy either just turning off or madly flickering on and off Either case makes the game impossible to play of course since you control your in game avatar with the left analog stick The first case is easy to fix just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu In the second case you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in Far more common than the controller bug are the load times They usually are not terrible but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so Between these and the long cut scenes you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included But there is game play and it is a lot of fun There is a great deal to keep you occupied from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts races puzzles and mini games Between fighting to save the world you can go fishing feed animals catch thieves and a lot more Plus after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras including image galleries and the sound track All of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out Rent it before you buy it if possible to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes numerous load times and weird voice effects But if you are a fan of action RPGs like Legend of Zelda you will definitely want to add Okami to your game library Summary Pros Great story Great graphics Great music sound Wonderful atmosphere Lots of culture and mythology to give it flavor Plentiful activities and mini games Unlockable extras after beating the game Cons Occasional graphic slowdown Too much exposition Tedious cut scenes Lots of load times Rare controller bug Neutral Voice noises that you might or might not hate Over all score Five stars of fun fun fun But three stars over all because of the many problems 
WOW a new legendary game this is a master piece its art its beatiful where do i start words don t describe this game i love it the music is wonderful this game combines all the the good elements in gaming into a single one mystical ninja music weirdness + zelda perfection and i mean that there are no missable events or items in the game although there is only one missable in the game + some dragonball ideas not power ups i played this game for 133 hours of course everything is completed and i m sorry it ended you can finish the game much faster but i tend to enjoy such masterpieces RESULT if you love traditional japanese music culture + perfectly programmed games then this game is for you 
Beautiful and Original Okami rates among the most beautiful games I ve ever seen The main point of the game is that you re the reincarnation of a god awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that s overtaken the land The entire landscape is bleak and dead affected by the evil and it s your task to both fight the ultimate evil and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that since the main character is folk tale diety in the form of a wolf the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next However this doesn t detract for the game overall At the same time the player does have a good deal of freedom I haven t felt railroaded through the storyline at all Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren t usually gamers If you re looking for something visually interesting occasionally humorous and with very different gameplay from the usual fare Okami is highly recommended 
Game Of The Year When I first looked at this game in the store I wasn t real sure about it I was totally surprised when I got it home and tried it out It starts out slow but that is only to prepare you for what is to come It has the greatest storyline and add great graphics wonderful characters and easy to learn controls Put all that together and you have OKAMI I am an avid gamer I love all types but mainly enjoy action adventure I am a 36 year old mother of 4 and I so enjoy sitting down with my kids and kicking their butt in a game of coarse we all have so much fun together I know that alot of people look down at video games in general but I DO SPEND QUALITY TIME with my kids Anyway this game was an absolute masterpiece It had it all I have played god Of War Samari Warriors 1 2 EX Legends Dynasty Warriors Norrath Balders Gate just to name a few This game was the icing on the cake I have never written reviews about any games before but I just couldn t keep from saying something about this game I plan to play it over and over because I know there is plenty more to do in this game that I may have missed the first time This game has to be a qualifier for if not the winner for GAME OF THE YEAR Respectfully Pretty Mam 
Amazing With the PS2 s life cycle coming to an end there are hardly any new games that are anything remotely spectacular Capcom s Okami however is just that and it s not just one of the best games to ever grace the PS2 it s one of the most original games you ll ever play The first thing you ll notice about Okami is the game s incredibly unique art style and graphics which are some of the best to ever grace the PS2 Seriously this game looks incredible you won t believe your eyes Okami s storyline is based on Japanese legend dealing with the sun god Amaterasu who you play as in the form of a white wolf and the epic quest that awaits him Now what truly sets Okami apart from the rest of the pack is the caligraphy esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game Need a bridge Draw it Need to dispatch a pesky enemy Draw him in half This brush adds a new dynamic to the gameplay which is fresh and unique and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type There s loads of side quests and mini games as well adding to the length of Okami which truly make it an epic game and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the PS2 If there s anything bad to say about Okami it s that the combat can get too easy at spots but that is only an extremely minor gripe All in all Okami is just the thing that PS2 owners have been waiting and yearning for An original epic adventure that doesn t get stale and provides some of the most unique and mouth watering graphics you ll ever see If you own a PS2 Okami is an absolute must own and it s one of the best games you ll ever play 
pantera Rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games 
The Beginning of the best game ever I have all the Grand Theft games and this is one of my favs I highly recommend it and all the others I recently purchased Liberty City Awesome 
A great way to release stress The best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city Fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars If you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the Internet then this is where the fun really begins These secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank this is only listing a few As always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old 
My Favorite Game of All Time Fable is easily one of the greatest games to ever be released The story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past it is compelling and very entertaining The gameplay is excellent it s not your typical RPG since this plays like an action adventure game I love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like The game also plays like real life You can get married divorced have sex and buy houses even decorate them The game is so real that you can choose to be straight gay or bi sexual depending on who you sleep with The only thing that is missing is that you can t have children but that should change in future installments Another cool thing about the game is that the more evil you get the more people are afraid of you But the more of a hero and savior you become you are greeted with praise and clapping in every town you go to Overall this game is a MUST HAVE The replay value is extremely high I have played and beat the game many times and I m still not tired of it If you love RPGs or hate RPGs this is still fantastic I can t wait until Fable 2 is released which is currently being completed Get this it is simply amazing 
0 This game was a new experience for me i didn t think i would like it but i did i like the story telling and it keeps you interested overall interesting fun and it will entertain you 
A truly unique game I really really enjoyed this game It was the only game I played for almost 2 months I was so hooked on it My only criticism is that the missions are too rigid so the outcomes are very much the same during re play even if you make different choices I thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do e g too much eating and he gets fat 
PS2 still the Best This is my second PS2 I traded my first on in on a Xbox 360 which only lasted 91 days before it died read all about it in my 360 review Leary of version 1 0 PS3 I opted to go back to the PS2 and its proven reliability and copious games for less money I got a set of HDTV cables a wireless controller and have not looked back What a fool I was to fall for Microscams empty promises This is the best game system You can even play online for free The games are more challenging and last a lot longer than the 360 games which I could beat in a week playing an hour a day The warranty is awesome at 1 year parts and labor I am not worried however because I had my original PS2 for 10 years without issue before trade in A fantastic system at an unbeatable price I will keep this one for at least a year before trading it in on a PS3 once all of the bugs are fixed and the price goes down to 400 Until then long live the PS2 
Great You can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric 
Hidden Gem First off the eyetoy is a great game peripheral Next it s getting some new games as well as it will be useable on the next gen console PS3 Third it is usable as a webcam on the pc In fact it is a fantastic webcam Only you need to download a inf a driver for the webcam There s tutorials out there Google it 
Amazing You can read that the Eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but I just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your PC by just plugging it into your computer s USB port 
What s the point of moving Seriously You could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth That is a perfect way of cheating The game is not bad after all 
Even the suckiest singers can do this We got a group of 5 friends together to do Guitar Hero 1 and 2 DDR and now Karaoke Revolution Party It s freaking cool The songs list is very good and there s something for everyone Easy to figure out too 
Amazingly fun game must buy Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs great easy gameplay and perfect party game features If you ve never tried a karaoke game now s the time to play First the basic setup You get to FULLY customize your character We re talking black white male female heavy skinny athletic Then you go for hair styles hair colors outfits down to the shoes and jewelry You can evey use your EyeToy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character It is simply amazing Then we go onto the song list I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems I love karaoke games This song list is by far my favorite song list of all time and it s true for my boyfriend as well There are a good mix of jumping songs slow romantic songs rocking songs and more In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs Because this is a party game they pretty much give you everything up front with a few exceptions You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters outfits as you go to keep things interesting A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes there are a bunch of fun mini games You can compete against other players try to play note matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game Even better if you have a dance pad you can sing and dance at the same time This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick but when you sing in a band you re actually expected to move around and dance Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills Even if you re not in a band you can see the challenges that your favorite singers face This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode or just singing along yourself with the songs Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had questionable versions of songs with them being obviously different from the original these songs are great sounding and many times I didn t have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them Highly highly recommended Rating 5 5 NOTE The previous reviewer says this has the Aretha Franklin version of Natural Woman I m rather sure it s the Carole King version 
A great game only gets better and better + 1 8 Players + Now has 50 songs + You can design and create your own characters or choose from old favorites + EyeToy lets you put yourself into the game + Duets + Option of using a dance pad and incorporating Dance Dance Revolution along with the singing + Gold Platinum Diamond perfect score rankings + 69 items to unlock and you can access the unlocking status to see what it takes to progress + They ve gotten rid of the solo challenge section which is where you had to unlock most of the items in the past + Games modes Quickplay one player version Arcade the player with the highest score wins Medley sing short clip versions of 3 5 songs all in a row Sing and Dance Minigames KR Challenge variety of game modes Duets Duets Medley Knock out Out sing your opponent to knock them out of the game Knock out Medley Sing off 2 players alternate lines to get the highest score + Demo of DDR Extreme that has 3 songs to choose from I have loved Karaoke revolution from the beginning I didn t think it could be any better than the 3rd version when they added the duets This version takes the game to a whole new level There is a wide variety of songs so many different types of people can play There are several songs that begin locked but it didn t take too long to get them unlocked The mini games are terrible and there was no need for them on the disk I found that it is near impossible to both sing and dance at the same time If you don t know all the words to a song it is impossible to read the singing and dance lines at the same time Besides it s extremely difficult to speak much less sing while exerting yourself on the dance pad I recommend having one person sing and another dance This changes it up and gives you some great songs to dance to I like the DDR games but never have been crazy about the songs so I really like the great songs Here is a complete list of the songs on the game as well as the artist of the version of the song Ain t Nothing Like the Real Thing Marvin Gaye Tammi Terrell Ain t Too Proud to Beg The Temptations Always Atlantic Starr American Woman Lenny Kravitz Brick House The Commodores Call Me Blondie Crazy Aerosmith Crazy in Love Beyonce Do You Really Want To Hurt Me Culture Club Drive Incubis Dust in the Wind Kansas Endless Love Lionel Richie Diana Ross Every Little Thing She Does is Magic The Police Everybody Wants to Rule the World Tears for Fears Everywhere Michelle Branch Santana Fame Irene Cara from the soundtrack Fly Hilary Duff For You I Will Monica Greatest Love of All Whitney Houston Headstrong Trapt Here I Go Again Whitesnake I Don t Want to be Gavin DeGraw I ve Had The Time of My Life Bill Medley Jennifer Warnes Dirty Dancing soundtrack I Left My Heart in San Francisco Tony Bennett I Love Rock and Roll Joan Jett I Will Always Love You Whitney Houston If You Could Only See Tonic I ll Be Edwin McCain Material Girl Madonna Me and Bobby McGee Janis Joplin Pain Jimmy Eat World Pieces of Me Ashley Simpson Play That Funky Music Wild Cherry Start Me Up The Rolling Stones Superstition Stevie Wonder Sweet Caroline Neil Diamond Takin Care of Business Bachman Turner Overdrive Take On Me A Ha That s Amore Dean Martin The Game of Love Michelle Branch Time After Time Cyndi Lauper Truth Is Fantasia Barrino Turn the Beat Around Gloria Estefan Unforgettable Nat King Cole Uptown Girl Billy Joel Waiting for a Girl Like You Foreigner What I Like About You Romantics Who Can It Be Now Men at Work You re My Best Friend Queen You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman Aretha Franklin Final Verdit Run don t walk to buy Karaoke Revolution Party 
Lemony Snicket A Series of Fortunate Family Game Events Lemony the game is not for hardcore gamers It doesn t aspire to be It shouldn t be compared to Warcraft or Resident Evil 4 The game was developed by AMAZE for Activision Any one familiar with the first three Harry Potter Movie co ordinated games through Electronic Arts EA Games is familiar with Amaze The first three Potter games were fun and a bit of challenge for children and for those adults who were new to PC gaming The player wandered around the magical world of Hogwarts collecting jelly beans and wizard cards What was fun was not completeing the tasks or learning new magic what was fun was the freedom to discover new areas and find secret places Fans of the Potter games will recognize the same mechanics of gameplay outfitted in a new location jelly beans are replaced with golden eyes golden hearts refuel stamina instead of chocolate frogs playbills and letters are granted instead of wizard cards Players will also recognize the flavor of wonderful score the game is set to enjoyable appropiate but not overbearing with some familiar notes Lemony isn t quite as good as the aforementioned Potter games The reason being Lemony is not a fun story While ficticious Lemony is a story of the relentless abuse of three very droll and very wealthy orphans Its much more fun to play as a boy who has left his abusive Aunt and Uncle behind entering a magical world to be educated at Hogwarts I rather enjoyed learning to how to fly Buckbeak in Prizoner of Azkaban In Lemony I m rather relieved I solved the train signal puzzle the thought of having children run over and over and over by a train until I did was depressing me Yet Lemony will provide some consolation to those who have been disappointed by EA s latest Potter offering The Goblet of Fire While there is an adjustment to the droll circumstances the task of discovering your world will take over and the game will eventually command your attention While Lemony isn t bad it isn t that good either They renderings of the children are not the most flattering they could be and the villians are boorishly ugly The gameplay controls aren t half as good as the Potter games and they weren t the greatest There s a match game puzzle in a cellar that only shows up per every install instead of every game I did complete it and nothing happened on my game which maybe the reason the puzzle won t show up in the rest of the games in a particular installation It has done this twice on me and I m not going to uninstall and install a third time to see if it happens again It had no effect on my score or letter or eye collecting The camera angles aren t well mapped for shooting I was supposed to shoot a rat but the camera got behind a ceiling lamp and while the rat was biting me all I could see was the inside of a lamp shade Suff like that Still its better than most children s games out there and it plays As you may have guessed there is violence When I shoot a rat in Lemony it is shot with a rotten egg lobber Rotten eggs are your bullets and the player stuns the enemies instead of killing them About time I ve played Lemony three times the third time it was going through the motions Once the few skills of jumping aiming the egg lobber and the boot puncher had been mastered there wasn t any interest left But for the time I did play I did enjoy it The games by AMAZE are a category unto themselves They are not action games based on a trigger finger nor are they the point click boring adventure games beset with brain teaser puzzles in a futuristic world They are a relaxing time where you don t have to test your brain just delight it If you have never played the Potter games and are new to PC gaming I recommend Lemony it is a good place to start If you are a fellow Potterhead and felt betrayed buy Goblet of Fire Lemony will sustain you 
The must have Memory Card Pack The memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great No read errors VERY noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it 
Playstation 2 Memory Card 8MB I love it that card my childrens have one for your own games 
good value for money I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card 
Best PS2 Memory Cards These are the best memory cards you can get for the PS2 Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 1PK Memory Card Rumors spread that non Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards 
Freaking Cool Videogame as Art WOW This game is so freaking cool The colossi are amazing I ve played my share of games and I can honestly say that I ve never encountered creatures like these before I m only about halfway thru the game having slain 7 colossi with 9 more yet to go and yet each new colossus that I meet astounds me all over again One thing about them that I have never felt in other games is that they envoke sympathy towards them Until you find them in their own little area of their world they are just giant hulks resting peacefully bothering no one But once disturbed they awaken and you must figure out how to take each one down I actually feel sad when they fall Supposedly your character must take them down to resurrect his lifeless lover however I get a sense that there will be a twist to this story before it ends Another equally awe inspiring aspect of this game is the environment in which you are playing It is without compare the most beautiful mystical unbelievably gorgeous landscape I ve seen in any game ever The world looks feels and sounds like an ancient place and time You just have to experience it This will be one of those games I ll remember years from today and will have to play all over again This game is a work of art just as certain films are plus it s just so freaking cool Don t miss it 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES FOR THE PS2 This game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay This game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is For example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them Some a lot more complicating than others And theres os many colossus that it takes a long time to beat them all So overall this game is great 
Great adventure but might be too simple for some Pros Awesome graphics Huge world to explore Great story line Easy to play You could to kill colossal enemies Cons All you do is kill the 16 Colossi There are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the Battle attack 
A Colossal Achievement Ico was a game that was very different from others It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio Imagine what Ico would be if action were incorporated into it you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus Ico s prequel SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels Presentation You stand in front of a deceased woman whose identity is unknown and are told that by defeating 16 colossi that roam the land you may be able to revive her but it may come at a price This sets up the shroud of mystery that surrounds SoTC as you start your journey You are given nothing but bows arrows a sword and your trusty horse Agro Graphics The land is sometimes colorful but it s supposed to be desolate so you won t see much life here The real kudos goes to the animation that occurs during the boss bottles Different motion blur affects really bring the game to a new level of realism And Agro s animation is also cinema worthy as well Gameplay The meat and potatoes of SoTC is the gameplay Ride on your steed in the direction of the colossus and begin to battle You have 2 bars grip strength and health Grip determines how long you can hold on to things such as the colossi themselves The best part of gameplay isn t done with your hands but your mind Each colossus is a puzzle that must be solved It can be determining it s weak spot or even how to get on the thing The colossus are so varied that each one will keep you guessing as to what to do next While it will be hard it will be one of the funnest experiences you ve ever had Audio Some of the same tracks are repeated throughout here but they never grow old The music seems to match the mood When you ve just met the colossus you ll hear soft music while you figure out what to do Then the music will rise as you mount the beast All the pieces in here sound good and are great pieces Overall When you ve beaten it and picked your jaw off the ground from the surprise ending it s not over yet You have time attack mode and hard mode which can be used to collect a few unlockables While such modes seem trivial to me I did mention that this was an extremely fun experience so even I had to go through it again This is an absolutely no brainer get Shadow of the Colossus now 
Surprisingly good I hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price Based upon various reviews and player feedback I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long a bit buggy and dumbed down Fortunately none of this was the case I had some good fun with this over a weekend yes it can be finished over a weekend and didn t come across a single bug Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind Oblivion Gothic 2 or some of the other great roleplaying games RPG out there but it does provide an enjoyable diversion Gameplay The controls are the typical WASD keys and mouse commands found in most single player RPGs The game is fairly easy to learn and navigate The story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood when he ll have to you know save the world There are no character classes per se but you can roughly play as a warrior magic user or stealth archer character or some mixture of these Much of the story centers around a main quest line but there are a number of side quests available Unlike most RPGs quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the Heroes Guild lol That s what it s actually called It s a rather artificial feeling system but it s functional Progression in the game is quite linear In most instances you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch since fences rocks and invisible barriers won t allow it Compared to more open ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard Overall it s a decent story but it is rather force fed to you The game includes several interesting touches People react to you based upon whether you ve performed good or bad deeds If you roleplay like a saint you ll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around Ladies and guys will worship you and you do have the option to buy a home and marry multiple times if you d like If you play as an evil character you ll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company The nonplayer characters in the game at least in the towns have jobs and schedules They work during the day and sleep at night though only quest related characters have anything to say of interest Although you can only play the game as the same guy you can customize him with tattoos facial hair haircuts and a small assortment of armor You can control how your character s skills develop but not as deeply as you can in a game like Morrowind or Baldur s Gate There are other small things that you can do such as fish play games of chance and treasure hunt Overall this game takes about 20 25 hours to do everything it has to offer so it is rather short for an RPG The things that I didn t much care for are not major but simply underscore the light weight nature of this particular game The game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd with hotkeys for burping farting and so forth The various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point There is nothing really offensive in the game it just feels a bit immature in places Also the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model You can t save just anywhere at least your quest progress will not save but the game will autosave at important junctures Graphics The game looks quite good Character models are convincing though a bit cartoonish and often repeated and the natural environment is screenshot beautiful in some places Since the pathing is fairly restrictive much of the scenary is noninteractive It s not like Oblivion or Gothic 2 where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it Sounds Voice acting is pretty good with the usual British accents that invariably seem to accompany such games The music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres Ambiant sounds are also decent Replayability Technical Issues The game is probably worth playing twice once as a good guy and once as a bad guy It will play similarly either way but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition Technically the game was perfectly stable on my computer no freezes crashes or other problems The manual is decent and explains much of the game along with the in game tutorial If you like RPG games and can get this one cheap go for it It s a well polished though simple rump through a fairly well rendered world Don t expect the same character depth engrossing story or exploring options that you ll find in some of the games that I mentioned above However Fable The Lost Chapters is good for several hours of entertainment 
Very nice RPG Back when it came out on Xbox I was incredibly angry I only had a silly gameboy but when it came out for computer I just had to have it I found the game very fun to play simple controls use arrows not wasd and felt very fufilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle It doesn t take long to finish this game but play is continuous if you watch the entire credits and you can always start over and switch to evil good side for a new version of the game 
Read this trust me Right just so everyone knows I have never played this game however i think you should read this I bought Fable and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it It is good enough but not supported so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible As they have actually put a list of cards on the site i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game Just thought you should know 
addicting but too much of I would be 5 on this one all the way because I enjoyed the game immensly the general idea of the game but because of personal preference I stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art If you like this game but don t want all the questionable material yes I know that it s nothing compared to other games then may I recommend Fate by wildtangen 
Looks Fab I do not own the headset yet but I have already ordered it from amazon and It is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so I will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes My impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous The price Great price I got mine for somthing like 25 buy from abuy4u but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset Yes 6 hours can last me a weekend 
Great Product Best Solution for wireless XBox First things first there IS a mute button on this unit If a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off I m guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either didn t read the instructions or couldn t figure out a product with three buttons on it power mute volume up and volume down Second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a Logitech wireless controller It works well and I noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular XBox communicator 
It s cool PROS 1 Wireless 2 Small 3 Lightweight 4 You can talk to your friends when you re in the bathroom 5 It has a lot of noises to tell you it s turning on and off and when the volume is at its max CONS 1 Cliking and poping noises 2 My charger doesn t connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 There is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 Have to charge it why can t it just have a fuel cell 5 No mute statis or indicator 6 It makes poping noises and a white nois 
Entertaining Yet Fairly Easy 4 Stars There isn t a whole lot I can add to the other reviews but I disagree when some say that this game is challenging I bought this game about a week ago and I ve already beaten it No guide no internet walkthroughs no cheats Honestly that s never been the case for me with ANY GTA game that I ve played Heck I m still trying to beat San Andreas I play straight up with no cheats or guides helpers and I ve had that game for over a year now The ending is kind of cheesy too but it s still a good game and makes for a great pacifier until the next GTA comes out And at 20 you can t really go wrong anyway 
The same game as GTA 3 Your back in liberty City just like GTA 3 you cant fly swim clime just like GTA 3 No graphics upgrade No airplanes Glitches like crazy Same as PSP But if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong 
Much less the same much less the same fun The Grand Theft Auto series and the PlayStation 2 have gone hand in hand which each game debuting on the PS2 before it travels to other consoles That all changed with the release of last year s side story Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories This game designed to take advantage of the PSP s hardware was an impressive technical feat managing to pack in a lot of what made the big GTA games so memorable But it fell short in a few key spots most notably the story the characters and the series biting sense of style and satire That stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry Liberty City around in your back pocket But on the PS2 where you can compare it directly to the three Grand Theft Auto games that have appeared there the whole package is significantly less interesting even considering the PS2 port s budget price Not much has changed so if you ve already played this on the PSP there s not much reason to take on the PS2 version The game s got a slightly longer draw distance on the PlayStation 2 and the streets look like they might have a few more people on them But neither of these things dramatically changes the game and they can t save the game s otherwise murky visuals and often poor frame rate But it also controls a little better with the right analog stick back in effect you ve got all the camera control and other buttons you re used to hitting on the PS2 It s neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy but if you didn t play it on the PSP Liberty City Stories 20 price tag is just right Just don t go in expecting anything approaching the grandiose nature of GTAIII let alone the bigger crazier Vice City or San Andreas And if you ve already played it on the PSP well there s little reason to play it again because this is the same game with the multiplayer modes stripped out As a return to Liberty City the New York themed locale first made famous back in Grand Theft Auto III Liberty City Stories is all about retreading through well worn territory If you still remember the streets of Liberty City you ll see plenty of the same spots here But as a game that was designed for the less powerful PSP you ll probably notice that Liberty City Stories is much smaller in scope than what we ve seen in the series more recently Missions which grew to epic proportions in San Andreas are much shorter and feel pretty meaningless in LCS There are plenty of moments where you ll complete a mission and immediately think Well at least I ll never have to do that again The story however is the biggest casualty Liberty City Stories tells the tale of one Toni Cipriani a regular type mob guy who did a good deed for the head of the Leone crime family Salvatore Leone Toni had to go away for awhile but the heat s died down and he s back on the job in Liberty City maintaining his loyalty to Sal while wiping out the family s enemies in droves along the way As you ascend to become Salvatore s right hand man you ll start and finish gang wars with other mafia types a few triads the yakuza pretty much all of the usual suspects are present If you re familiar with the various mafia presences over the course of the past three GTA games you ll recognize a few of the names and faces here But the story stands alone and doesn t require you to remember the various cast members That s a good thing because the mafia characters in the other GTA games have been largely forgettable The game s storyline really isn t up to par with the console installments in the series because very little actually happens Even potential plot points are squandered like when Toni finally becomes a made man but a bad cutscene doesn t actually show the ceremony The game s mission path doesn t deviate into crazy territory and most of the characters are fairly lifeless There are no enigmatic weirdos like Truth the crazy hippie from San Andreas or Steve Scott the porno director from Vice City to break up the heavier handed mafia tasks This dulls the game s personality preventing its characters and events from becoming as memorable as we ve come to expect from GTA games and their excellent storylines 
Gta Liberty City Stories This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It s Sort Of Like A Prequal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don t Own A Psp I d Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn t Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA 
I dont know about this VP I bought this one the same time I did Baten Kaitos Origins and I can say it don t hold up to the original but comes close you can tell Square had their hands in this one I liked the 2 D style of the first one the 3 D graphics are very impressive but dont really fit with the gameplay My 4 star overall comes again from the battle system It holds true to the 1 button controls 1 character but the movement system needs to go it uses a full range system like Star Ocean but changes to the attack view to do the fighting similar to the original Ultimate Magic and those really awesome super moves are still intact Im not far into the game and they already have 2 characters from the original star here and thats Arngrim and Lezard Valeth which is cool they were 2 of my favs i cant wait to see all the characters If the make Valkyrie Profile 3 Hrist I would like to see a return of the hand drawn sprites and the riddence of that movement system 
Never got to the first and I don t care I never played the original and don t really want to This game was such a treasure to find with it s phenomonal music and graphics engrossing gameplay twisted plot and the variety of characters possible to play I have lost a lot of sleep over this game and I m not even half way done If anything it has some of the best show of PS2 graphics I have seen something to expect from a Square Enix production The wind moving through the environments the water trickling the sort of dream like haze in the towns It all culminates into an eye pleaser if nothing else But the gameplay and game engineering is also top quality The character designs are very diverse with many periods of time and cultures represented There is a fairly even mix of female and male characters as well as classes like archers light warriors mages ect The menu navigation and ability to load different game data at anytime other than combat is a serious perk that many take for granted You can keep loading a game when you don t get the einherjar you want until the randomized selection gives you the perfect group you are looking to adventure with The ability to instantly travel to any location on the map without lengthy travel from location to location keeps the pace nice and brisk giving you only what you want buying equipment and battles The difficulty is right where it needs to be if you do a quick run game you will have a tough time beating the boss It s nice not to have leveling forced on you but rather as an elective thing so that you can get through the story when you want to The battles are clever mixing tactical RPG with action making it very engaging and actually fun There is a degree of button mashing but then again it s not a static or boring as the your turn my turn cast a spell drink a potion It s actually combat like it should be I can t praise this game enough I don t care how good the first was it can t be better than this one This will certainly go down as a best title for the PS2 If I had any complaints it would be the recycled voice commentary for different einherjar and the fact that they really aren t involved with the main story line Oh and since they would be stupid not to make a third one customizable armor would have been the cream of the crop VP2 is a solid offering for the last PS2 has to offer 
Solid but contains the pitfalls of most tri ace games My experience with developer tri ace s games dates back to the original Playstation era with Star Ocean The 2nd Story Like most gamers on this side of the world this was probably the one of the first tri ace titles that had and created enough of a buzz to form a niche of fans The other game which is credited with a simular yet even bigger buzz was the original Valkyrie Profile Unfortunately the yield from the initial pressing run of that game was so low so tri ace wouldn t lose to much if the game didn t sell or catch on by the time I had heard the hype surrounding VP and wanted to give the game a try it was much too late copies of the game were selling at astronomical prices on e bay much like how sealed copies of Final Fantasy VII are selling now Because of this I was ecstatic when a sequel which in this case is actually a prequel was announced so I could finally experience what I had missed out on the first time in one form or another Granted VP2 is not a complete carbon copy of the original but the majority of the gameplay elements cross the game generation gap so in essence this game should probably give you an idea of what the original itself was like So would I say that I was blown away or impressed by what I missed out with missing the original VP Not really To start with the game is simply beautiful There are some dazzling effects from leaves and grass waving in the breeze to various types of weather pounding some of the locals This is what one should expect from a last generation PS2 title Sure every once in a while the battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters are standing on air but that is so minor it doesn t matter The only gripe I have is I wish the characters weapons changed depending on what they currently have equipped However since the character designs are so dependant on the default look of the weaponry the above simply wouldn t work very well Combat is Valkyrie s claim to fame much like it is in other tri ace games like Star Ocean This is a good thing considering the amount of time you ll spend in battle mode leveling up the game s massive number of characters of which only a handful are actually involved in the story the others just seem to be there At a quick glance the battle system seems to be a button mashers dream but like a good 3D fighting series Soul Caliber or Tekken those who know what their doing will always get further or have less difficulty as things can be difficult enough Other combat related issues also sprout up reviving an ally requires you to be near the ally s body and status effects are so not your friend especially when the whole party is inflicted at once especially with poison shutter As fun as combat is there are quite a few hitches to be aware of such as wasting AP on a dash and getting nowhere because your party is caught on the edge of something in the environment or when party members become separated for the same reason limiting your attack options until you take the time and go back and get them This becomes especially aggravating when you re trying to finish battles as quickly and efficiently as possible to receive experience and crystal bonuses The change from a 2D fighting environment in VP to a 3D one in VP2 works but the above issues make you yearn for 2D battles of the original which would probably be devoid of these problems The game s skill system is another area that initially seems interesting and clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome You ll form rune words with your equipment and accessories to unlock new potential skills Note the word potential in the previous sentence Unlocking a new skill doesn t grant the character the skill automatically only though battle can the skill be used and permanently learned At first glance this is a good thing since it prevents abuse think FFIX skill system here but the player then quickly finds out it may well usually take a long to learn said skill Instead of being awarded a set amount of points towards your skills after an enemy defeat like in most normal RPGs a percentage earned towards potential skills based on the average level of your current party and that of the enemy s Because of this you ll constantly be seeking out stronger and stronger enemies and you ll hardly ever find an undeniable great place to level up You ll also be contending with the never ending equipping and unequipping of equipment while doing this and often means your party is usually far from wearing the strongest available equipment at all times something that is usually a given in most RPGs Traversing dungeons is probably the most noteworthy aspect of VP2 after the battle system The first few are a complete cakewalk and teach you the ropes the later ones can really test you sanity and your brainpower Correct sealstone usage and photon know how go a long way towards completely clearing them of all their contents Kudos to tri ace for the awesome auto map feature features like this need to become an industry genre standard In the sound department Motoi Sakuraba makes a rather subdued yet solid entrance seeming to ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style of composing It s not until much later until you hear a piece and you know yeah that s Sakuraba no doubt The voice overs are good but at the same time just a few tiers above decent Valkyrie Profile 2 also falls victim to problems that are prevalent in other tri ace games Some moments of unbalanced gameplay creep up on the player as the difficulty goes up a few notches without much warning The story is once again slow to start is this even a surprise anymore with tri ace games and some of the story twists you can see coming a mile away the one revelation at the end of Chapter 3 was so freaking obvious All this said is Valkyrie Profile 2 worth playing if you ve never experienced VP Yes However now having experienced it I honestly think I could have had waited for a price drop instead of buying it on day it came out Despite this I still look forward to playing the re release of the original on the PSP 
Mediocre Story but Fun Gameplay In truth there really hasn t been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993 Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings and Children of Mana is no different Why did I buy it knowing this For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games There s always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did Unfortunately Children of Mana does not do this It doesn t rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us but that shouldn t suggest it falls short of it either The world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages It is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you ll set out to save the Mana Tree and the world itself Children of Mana by no means has a great storyline going for it At least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay No matter how you look at it Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler It is an RPG but it falls into the dungeon crawling category When you enter dungeons they re just swarming with monsters and you ll be surrounded before you know it So you ll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss take him on and then you re done Rinse and repeat The process does at times become annoying but Children of Mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it The first tidbit of interest is how combat works It s actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things It s surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours You ve got three hit combos you can perform on enemies You can knock enemies into other enemies There s quite a bit of intersting things you can do However what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can t ahead of yourself too fast First and foremost you can t equip and use everything you find right off the bat The game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations This keeps the game from being too simple You ll also have access to magic of course Each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you It s interesting to play around with as well In dungeons you can also dual wield weapons although not in the way you d think When I say duel wield I specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time So you can t go about swinging both of them at the same time which probably would ve added more variety to the gameplay otherwise Along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities It s interesting but not really all that deep You ll mostly find or purchase these gems Another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer Children of Mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on and they re actually pretty well worth it The problem with the gameplay however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast The objective in just about every dungeon is to find what s called a Gleam Drop and then bring it back to the Gleam Well It s annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way Fight through a horde of enemies retrieve the Gleam Drop fight a boss and leave Over time it becomes increasingly repetative However Children of Mana has a great remedy for that too It s multiplayer Up to four players can play at a time and the game is so much more fun that way You and your friends can make your way through dungeons together and sometimes it s just a blast to do There are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode but it s nothing to get too frustrated with because it doesn t happen too often The multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay As far as graphics go the game doesn t look too bad The sprites look like they re ripped straight ouf of Sword of Mana and the game is completely 2D However the Mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit they ve been about its unique art style which in Children of Mana is absolutely gorgeous It s artwork is just beautiful to look at Each environment is given extremely good detail The only problem as I mentioned are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed Musically Children of Mana sounds fantastic It s one of the best sounding DS games out to date Very few of the current games hold a candle up to it s fantastic soundtrack The bottom line is simple Children of Mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline There s just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with However keep in mind that Children of Mana really is just a dungeon crawl and it s uncrealistic to expect an RPG that s all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away On the whole if you re looking for a game that s fun you ll find it with Children of Mana However if you re looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters you won t find it in Children of Mana The Good +Beatiful Artwork +Fantastic Soundtrack +There s a lot of variety to the gameplay +Multiplayer is a blasts +Tons of sidequests to do The Bad The storyline isn t good The gameplay has a lot of vareity but it s hard to get past the fact that it s repetativ 
Feed me Seymour I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single player campaign I never played the multiplayer game until I bought Halo 2 Let s get this out of the way first Halo 2 s multiplayer is unparalleled With a multitude of multiplayer games Capture the Flag Juggernaut Team vs Team etc and a dizzying variety of terrains there s plenty to keep Halo fans busy blowing each other up The addition of the alien Elites as a playable character spice things up You can also wield two weapons at a time one in each fist providing another combat option for those gunslingers that like their battles John Woo style Unfortunately Halo 2 s single player campaign is not as impressive To whit the alien Covenant s entire society is based on the idea that activating the giant rings throughout the universe known as Halos will put them on their journey of spiritual evolution The reality is that Halo is a weapon designed to destroy the Flood an infestation of aliens who turn human and alien alike into vicious zombies And how do you keep the Flood from infecting every living thing Why by utterly destroying every living thing in the universe of course Play alternates between Master Chief and the alien elite known as the Arbiter This gives the player both sides of the story which is interesting to a point Eventually the plot converges enough so that the two characters should really end up fighting each other That would have been something if the AI made you play through both battles from opposite sides by creating an enemy that uses your own moves But instead about midway through the battle for the universe a giant plant that looks like Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors shows up This planet speaking in Jabba esque guttural tones rams the plot down our throats by grabbing the Arbiter and Master Chief and shoving them into opposite plot lines the Arbiter ends up working with the humans Master Chief ends up doing the alien dirty work Then things really get going and just as Halo 2 hurtles towards the final battle on Earth the game ends I should have guessed something was up when during E3 interviews about Halo 3 the CEO of Bungee only had this to say Are you ready to finish the war What he meant was Are you ready to finish the game you thought you were finishing in Halo 2 As you ve probably noticed from my review of the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean I really really REALLY hate movies and games that fail to provide a whole story It doesn t matter that this is part two of a three part series Writers and developers have an obligation to provide a full story you CAN create a story with a beginning and end even though it s the middle of a series as evidenced by The Two Towers Halo 2 is an improvement on the original but it loses points for a weak campaign that forces you to play both sides then throws in a talking plant to clean up the mess 
Yea After my little brother lost my original copy I had to buy a new one and I am so glad I did I love the game and it was so much fun to play Like all Final Fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay 
actually pretty simple If you liked final fantasy 3 you ll like this game You ll play some then learn some more of the story 
Final Fantasy VIII is underrated It s better than Final Fantasy VII I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII From the introductory movie I was hooked The world and story were very unique as well as the new battle system I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it I loved it more than the materia system of VII The characters in VIII were all very likeable It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the Final Fantasy series The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments From start to finish I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general 
incredible until you get to level 4 first off let me say for the most part katamari damacy is an amazing game if you don t know the story behind it well it wasn t thought up by game designers and that s why it s so original the game ideas came from a lady who didn t even like video games and they used her ideas to make it in a world where if you ve played one RPG you ve played them all if you ve played one shooter you ve played them all etc katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air and i m glad it s popular the music is strangely catchy it has a great sense of humor the attention to detail is absolutely astounding a ton of work must have went into this game and it s surprisingly very addictive and fun in fact unless you ve actually played this game you won t understand how fun and addictive it is show me many games and i can say i d like that or i wouldn t like that but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand and there s even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend you roll around a katamari a ball of stuff and pick up more and more stuff that automatically sticks to your katamari the bigger your katamari gets the bigger stuff you can pick up if this sounds stupid to you there s a reason you haven t played it yet trust me it rocks while katamari damacy looks like a kid s game it s not there s too much strategy too much nuance here for young minds on the other hand younger kids can play chess so maybe but generally kids play stuff like halo 2 that requires little thought my complaint is level 4 i ve tried about 10 times to beat this level and from what i see i don t think i will ever be able to so for me the game stops here it has a 10 minute time limit and the closest i ve got 73 cm i need to get to 1 m i m not a gaming genius or anything but i m at least an average gamer and regularly play online against other gamers and do very well in my opinion they really dropped the ball on this level with such a strict requirement to be honest i m really surprised anybody has beaten this level with so little time how many more times should i try 5 20 100 it s disappointing maybe me and my katamari is more gaming friendly another thing is the view on the screen isn t quite big enough it s very easy to be lost with so little of a view you can t change the camera angle you can only turn around it would probably be better with a bigger camera view and a camera that changes angles automatically also the controls to turn around and charge are too difficult to turn around you press L3 and R3 at the same time why not just have us a press a button to charge you flip the analog sticks up and down really fast too much trouble for a feature that s pretty useless anyway why would you want to run when you ll just run into something anyway the game consists of a lot of moving back and forth and to the side you don t need to move forward fast so it s not a perfect game but it s very impressive nonetheless i just wish i could play the rest of it 
Weirdly addictive disappointingly short I played this game with some friends out of town and seriously had to acquire a PS2 just to satisfy my craving Not a shooter game not an rpg you just roll Seriously It s surprisingly awesome actually but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing it was done I d beat it and I m really not a big gamer And I don t know how much mileage I m really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2 player mode Maybe the sequel is better I hope 
Great Game when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games I new i wanted it My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on 
Fantastically Bizarre Unlike any other game you ve ever played in the best possible way I am easily bored and or grossed out by the traditional racing shooting killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change Challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time Other reviewers have said it ends too soon but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score So if you barely beat the level you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water Perfect for a pair of obsessive compulsives like my fianc� and me He thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than I do AND his 6 going on 7 year old son loves it too There isn t anything that would be inappropriate for any age but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn t get it After he goes to bed we play the insanely gory Jaws game you get to be the SHARK You might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast but the King of All Cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises The levels just get cooler and cooler Also the music is fantastic It will have you singing along in no time Na na na na na na na na KATAMARI DAMASHI It doesn t even make sense but I love it I just ordered the second Katamari game We Love Katamari Nuff said 
KIDS WILL LOVE THIS GAME I got this game for my kids One is 11 and one is 9 They love it They can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it Like baseball soccer boxing etc Hey this even come with the camera I rated 4 stars because of the graffics They are not the best but still acceptible Hope this review helps 
Best game for kids money can buy I bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys They play this game NON STOP basically until they re completely worn out The game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months If your kids have a PS2 then this game is a must have 
Hey Ho We re not gonna go So these little fellas are inside my computer They run around all day shouting Doodlee doo Doodlee doo I m thinking that they re up to no good I m thinking that they re plotting against me But I can t turn them off They say if I do then evil will befall me Caution Beware 
A Star Wars game that s actually gasp good and not just a half baked product placement tool BioWare s decision to make the game pre date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom even within the confines of the Star Wars brand The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game of the year awards yes over 40 is not because you get to swing a double bladed lightsaber around and use Force powers it s because of the story A strong plot is crucial for every RPG and KOTOR doesn t disappoint This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history all you fans out there know what I m talking about If you don t then go out and buy this game now The game s principal characters while somewhat stereotypical i e Bastila is the condescending socialite snob Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past etc work very well together and have good chemistry including with you the created character For example if you play as a female character it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago You ll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don t get along with each other i e Canderous and Carth because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before And aside from the character development the game feels very rich in its Star Wars ness for example some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them Despite what I said earlier in this review cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own lightsaber as I wondered what color I was going to choose Having said all that there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars I felt the game was a bit linear being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open ended gameplay I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good but everything plays the same save a few minor events and certain conversations Also there is a doorway bug that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors When this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself I ve never had any real problems with this bug but it can get distracting Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic you press start to go to the main menu then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds Also I m sure many people would agree that the game s graphics are not up to Xbox standards even the PS2 is capable of doing better I don t usually gripe about graphics but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable Overall I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR and a few other titles but that s another story and I m glad I made the investment Hey stop reading this and go play 
One of the best RPG games ever Pros Exciting and absorbing story line Great gaming experience Cons Some minor bugs Single player game Cannot replay more than a few times 
Lucas Arts at it s best First point thankfully this wasn t directed by good ole George The setting of the game is 4 000 years before the Star Wars A New Hope and a few years after the devastating Mandolorian Wars This a truly fun Role Playing Game RPG including interesting characters everone of them with unique histories including yours an almost flawless turn based combat system a sinister universe dominating villian ect At this point the graphics aren t the greatest but are still nothing to scoff at There are some bugs with the dialogue and movies but nothing serious The music produced by the gaming world famous Jeremy Soule is amazing and completely allows the player to become immersed with gameplay Basically every action mostly dialogue has a good Light Side Neutral and bad Dark Side outcome For some reason the dark side way of going about things is more fullfilling Many movie seen force powers lightning force choke as well as some powers known to Knights of the Old Republic KOTOR are included keeping you on your toes while playing Spoiler Alert Incredilby it is a small universe all of the characters you meet that become apart of your party have to do with your past self Over At two parts of your journey once in the begining and once more a fourth of the way in the player gets to choose the class of his her character First time around what kind of grunt of the Old Republic s are you and second what kind of SUPER ALL POWERFUL KICK A BITE YOUR HEAD OFF Jedi are you One of the best XBox games ever period and one of the better RPGs out there as well 
Very addictive just like a good game should be This was a well put together game that was lots of fun to play You ll want to play it again as soon as you finish it I m not a big Star Wars fan but I was nuts for this game This was the first RPG I ever tried and once I got over the fact that I was not doing the fighting I really liked it I highly recommend this game UNLESS you already have a weak relationship with your wife kids who you won t be seeing much of or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary eyed so he can pink slip you 
40+ Hours and never boring This game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations There are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light Either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force Crush on your opponent you are very lucky Give this game a whirl 
To be Expected Quite honestly i think it is to be expected that the original would be better than the second especially with a series such as this where you choose what happens in the plot light or dark side With the first game of a series such as this its easier to write a plot that will run smoothly because you have a clean slate but with the second game you cant really make it so it runs so smoothly You have to make the game so it runs smoothly no matter which path you chose on the first game which i think is a pretty difficult task They did ok with this task but at times the actual story line was quite confusing but overall they did ok I do think they did a better job with the powers and such You were able to get a lot higher level then you did in the previous game so you received more powers The game was not awful by any means I think that if you play the game knowing its not going to live up to KOTOR 1 you will enjoy it quite a bit more I recomend that you play the first KOTOR before playing this one because then you will see the series at its full potential and appreciate it a lot more Also know that it s not going to be as good as KOTOR 1 when you start playing it helps quite a bit 
Shut up you idiots I don t really review games because videogames are nothing much to talk about But anyway these obe star reviewers are all idiots Okay so sometimes idiots who play this game for ten hours a day are idiots also but that s not the point The people who write one star reviewers are all stupid fragile Hilary Clinton Supporters ans support that stupid dumbf jack thompson Freaking imbeciles Okay now this game rules This game kciks beacuse I can do anything I want If I want to race a car blah blah blah I just wanted top get myu point across to the one star reviewers If you don t have this get it I don t care how but get it Remember that most people who write crap probally actually never tried it or stupid like Jach Thompson 
Very sick but that s the fun No way should children be playing this game It is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players The goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it s just a fantasy Many people go into the details so I ll make this short Have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts But there s no way I would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then I would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy 
Don t you forget it I loved this game so much I have gone and got a second copy mine has stopped working I love the feeling that an entire world lives within the game and you can always just steal a car and ride listen to the radio and take in Vice City s many sites Tommy Vercetti excellantly cast as Ray Liotta of Goodfellas fame gets out of the slammer and goes back to his turf He gets sent to Vice City to get him out of the way because really they don t want him around anymore and they certainly don t want to answer his questions about why he got jailed You can ride bikes take cars helicopter fly over the city go through districts with different cultures and work for many gangs Bikers Columbians cops even accompanied by a sound track that beats the heck out of any other game I ve played A radio with enough variation to keep everyone happy as they do their drive bys and cruise looking at women And the talk shows Classy touch The game play is smooth and with barely a bug to be seen flows from day to night and back again with the city in sync Vice City at night is amazing you also get weather variations and the impact of that in the rain bikes tend to skid more and you fall off It s that kind of attention to detail that means the game never grows tiresome The hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi paramedic etc missions mean the game really is so open ended It s been three years and I m still exploring Vice City Classic 
Classic PS2 Game Despite all of the controversy over its violent content the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck In my opinion Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the best game out of the series so far Yes the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas but Vice City is a better overall experience The setting is beautiful there are more properties that you can own and the automotive firearm and weapon selections are also quite large The soundtrack to this game is amazing From 80 s pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio its all here Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun challenges and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package 
Excellence gets an upgrade As you might have guessed this is another cool game I have played in the arcade AND IT ROCKS Time Crisis 2 was wonderful but this is just outstanding I mean it has cooler graphics more usable weapons including grenades YOWSERS better sound effects and above all such terrific explosions shot hits music and gameplay that it makes this the best Time Crisis Game I ve ever played in my whole entire BEEP ing life When I played this in the arcade I had tons and tons of fun Why you think I put five stars for the fun rating To make this game even more enjoyable I used the fact I am a lover of animals and good people most especially lions tigers jaguars and sexy women of all sorts I imagined that those kinds of innocents mentioned were being threatened that the enemy in the game was the poacher slime threatening them as you know I not only love big cats all cool animals and decent human beings I also HATE HATE HATE poachers and that I was the hero along with a sidekick who meant to save the women and the three large cat races Needless to say every time I killed an enemy with bullet or grenade I let loose the words Go to hell poacher scumbags which of course made the game all the more enjoyable as did saving lives which I imagined as either a big cat species or a beautiful woman Anyway whether you imagine this or not this game is the best coolest most fun Time Crisis ever made and if you like shooting games or video games in general for that matter you must either play this in the arcade like me or if you got a PS2 buy it and enjoy I d say it rivals the masterpiece that is Silent Scope it s so perfect 
I Dont Have This Game But I ve played it countless times at the arcade and I think it is one of the best games for ps2 cause actually I m more of a PC gamer amd it is the best of it s kind If youre looking for a guncon game this is for you gameplay as i ve said BEST OF ITS KIND TC3 is one of the few guncon games that will keep you glued to the tv and in my case arcade screen for hours and hours and wont get repetitive and the multi weapon system will give you more strategy and less in a good way mindless crazy shooting For example if you were outnumbered in a closed space with a lot foes on the screen in any other guncon game youd have to shoot them all down one by one ducking like a madman and losing time but now youd just select the nade launcher aim and clear the area of enemies but the grenade launcher has a limited amount of ammo so would you spray with the uzi with a fast rate of fire or use the shotgun that spreads its bullets your choice but the strategy doesnt bore the game you still ave plenty of time to shoot people silly graphics the graphics arent like Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but its still isnt horrible and anyway you wont mind the graphics when youre really playing the game Sound the dialog is crappy like any other guncon game but everything else is above par and again you wont care about the sound when youre really playing the game story Not the best its predictable corny and it isnt complex at all but if you re looking for a great storyline in a guncon game you need serious help Overall the only flaws I could find were that the game was overpriced 60 and that the guncon is pretty fragile From what I ve heard Other than that its a must buy for anyone who likes shooting crazy action or wants to let their anger out on some terrorists 
Good for more than just entertainment I ve got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games I ve bought not that they were bad though The funny thing about these kind of games so long as you re using a light gun is that they improve your accuracy with firearms It s no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games Now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real But then again that is part of what gives the game it s charm Buy the game and a light gun 
5 star review Time crises is a 5 star gam 
Another blast from the past that doesn t disapoint Square Enix is going back in time with their latest Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS titles First we had Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the GBA which were brilliant recreations of the original Nintendo Entertainment System titles that started the Final Fantasy series way back when Then last year we had the first SNES Final Fantasy game in Final Fantasy IV Advance on the GBA which recaptured the fun that really made the series a house hold staple keeping the game the same as we remember with extras added in to make it even more fun then we remembered Final Fantasy III which was a Japanese only exclusive NES game is now on the Nintendo DS introducing a new yet old game to fans old and young Now with thier next title in Final Fantasy V will Square Enix again capture the magic that made their old games so much fun The answer is absolutely yes This game is a great example of why the job class system that Final Fantasy has become well known for is so much fun to interact with You start out with a team of four who have to save four special elemental crystals from being destroyed Every time a crystal does happen to be destroyed the crystals will lend the would be heroes it s powers letting them change thier classes into more powerful fighters magic users and specialist in the hopes of saving various worlds from a great evil in the name of Exdeath The story can be a bit on the weakside Besides the point of fighting evil just because they are good guys and that s what good guys do there is not much more to the story then your typical Final Fantasy situation The real draw of the game is the idea of building your dream team of characters in the classes you want to build them into Some of the classes most will be familiar with if you have played a Final Fantasy Tactics game There are some new and unique ones but over all they all have their pro s and con s and let you switch between them easy enough while being able to use previously learned abilities from one job into another job There are your typical classes in the Knight Black Mage White Mage Monk and Thief While there are more obscure job titles like Berzerker Dancer Beastmaster and Bard that add a lot of originality and newness to the game as it lets you be classes that you may have never thought of being in a Final Fantasy world A lot of the game will focus around you leveling up due to the fact that the only way to learn new skills for your current classes are to gain job points by winning battles Also it can get quite expensive buying equipment for all the different classes as a lot use very specific weapons like whips bows and axes while most use swords and daggers So this game is not one that you will be able to rush through quickly if you want to get the full experience out of it Overall this is a great addition to any fan of a good RPG series both young and old The story is the only weakness as it could have been a bit better but the fun of the game and your own ability to choose what type of fighters you want to use at any given time make you forget quickly of the story going on and keeps you focused on the action and having fun with the many classes to find With three worlds over 20 class choices bonus classes and dungeons not found in the original games and so much more to do in this game you definitely can t go wrong picking this up A very worthy yet not as well known game in the long running Final Fantasy series Especially with Final Fantasy VI Advance on the way this is a great way to pass the time until it becomes available This isn t the greatest Final Fantasy game but it seems to fit in perfect to the portable setting it has been put into Get it today so you too can max out all the job abilities for all the characters 
it s good You already knew it was a good game becuase it s Final Fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games This one is probably a little worse than the best Final Fantasy games such as III and VII but despite that what you have here is a Game Boy Advance RPG that has graphics that actually aren t that bad and the storyline is pretty good too You just can t go wrong with Final Fantasy games 
It s Alive Before Kurt Warner had a career with the St Louis Rams he played for the Arenabowl champion Iowa Barnstomers when he endorsed this game called Kurt Warner s Arena Football Unleashed The music is rockin and up to date you can crank it up to The sound effects are great on this game if you hear that doink sound it looks like a Hanna Barbera cartoon and the commentary is way better than that Tim guy from NFL Blitz Oh and for every touchdown you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6 This game is way more better than NFL Blitz unfortunately it was the last hope for any more Arena Football games on any system 
Close to real I m an AFL fan and have been for a while so I got this game since it sounded interesting It s not the truest sim out there it s more like NFL Blitz but indoors Still it s a very fun game if you remember the 2000 AFL season I would have liked to seen more of these games for each season At least this game will satisfy my appetite for AFL football I would suggest all AFL fans to get this game simply for the joy it will bring to you and the fact that this is the only repesentation of the best brand of football out there I just wish other smaller leagues like the WNBA would get a contract for games since there are many fans of these lesser known sports that would love to have sim games GO RATTLERS GO PRED 
One awesome football game I ll admit I was a little skeptical about this game As it turns out this game rocks Arena Football fans do not pass this one up Hopefully when they make the sequel yeah I said SEQUEL they will include the new AFL2 teams Tennessee Valley Vipers rule 
Bully ROX After the incredible Monkey Island series was halted I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines entertaining dialogue and lush scenery Then Bully came along and I was hooked This really is a great game and you shouldn t be set against it because it s really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto There s no blood no sexuality except for kissing and there s so many involving and engrossing storylines The characters are also some of the best I ve ever seen each having their own stories and personality The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school GET BULLY IT S AN AWESOME GAME People who like this game should also look at the Monkey Island series of games for PC and PS2 and the Nancy Drew series for PC 
A lot of fun but too short and too easy This game was a lot of fun you can do so much and the dark humor was great The only gripe I have is that it was just way to short and easy I easily beat this game in about 3 days and I still have 2 days left on my rental I would say rent this game because you can easily beat it within a week So overall here is a break down of the Pros and Cons Pros Playing pranks on students The missions are a lot of fun The side missions are also a lot of fun bring more to the story Good Dark Comedy like all other Rockstar games Unlocking funny constumes like the black ninja costume to stay out past curfew All the different Cliques were great and being able to beat up and bully anybody is a lot of fun Cons Just way too easy the missions can be beaten very easily Incredibly short nothing like the Grand Theft Auto Games where it can take a month to unlock everything I was able to unlock everything in 3 days Would ve loved to see some of the same things from GTA SA in Bully EX In GTA SA you are able to have gang members follow you and do what you want It would ve been great to see that in Bully Overall I would suggest renting a lot of fun but easily beaten not worth 50 
GTA meets Harry Potter I just received this game yesterday and I ve already put a few hours worth of time into it You can t help but notice the Rockstar trademark graphics and intro Although the controls and character movements I think have improved over the San Andreas controls and movement I found it challenging to balance the time in this game The clock moves pretty fast and you have to run around finding challenges as well as watching the clock to make sure you aren t truant from class or trespassing at night when you re supposed to be in bed You also have to really watch out for the Prefects which by the way is the same term used in Harry Potter Maybe it s a British thing I have to disagree with the one reviewer saying that Jimmy is not a Bully He isn t like the other bullies but he does have to win the respect of others GTA style by protecting and beating up the Bullies So basically Jimmy bullies the bullies Breaking into lockers running errands for the underpriveleged flirting with girls getting good grades in class riding around on a skateboard and one of my favorites is Dodgeball in Gym Class And these are all things I ve come across in the first few hours of play What s next Get this game It s a vast array of ecleptic gaming skills and entertainment styles you won t regret it And if you are also looking for a completely original game graphics like I ve never seen before I noticed alot of Bully buyers get Okami which I did also and that is like no other game graphics wise VERY artistic for those who s girlfriends get tired of watching you play the same ol It is pleasing to the eye Very artistic and original 
Rant N Rave Well after all the media attention Bully has arrived It would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again May be now they ll focus on some real problems facing our poor children Not only did this game prove not to be a Columbine handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens Well the rant is over now for the rave The game mechanics are excellent Like many of Rockstar titles they ve improved on the GTA engine allowing smoother play Stepping away from the mission types in the GTA series Bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the GTA typical T A wholesale killing Now don t get me wrong I enjoy the GTA series and most of Rockstar s other releases I never passed shop class though Seeing the GTA open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation The mini games are fun and addictive I wish they would have other classes represented With Bully you get to not only play a great game but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time Overall this is an excellent game worth your time and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be 
No objection needed for this game Just to add my 2 cents to an already glowingly reviewed title a couple more clues as to how well received this game was 1 After selling through the initial stock Capcom stopped shipping copies of the game An uproar from the gaming community ensued and existing copies started selling for 2 3 times the SRP in online auctions before Capcom announced that they will ship more copies 2 At E3 there was a trailer revealed for a Phoenix Wright sequel on the DS which is the sequel to the original game in Japan but will be titled in the USA as Justice For All If you are up for unconventionally written games with quirky charm this is a fun title to sit back relax and laugh with 
Anime law and order meets adventure puzzler The hilarity adventure wit and fun of this game is nothing shy of stupendous amazing great marvelous It has a certain nostaglia to it with a new twist on the adventure puzzle genre Think of all the games that consumed our time back in the day such as King s quest Police Quest and Leisure Suit Larry and put it to the tune of trials evidence and investigation with hints of an RPG text adventure and anime and you ll land on Phoenix Wright It s concept does seem retro but it really is like nothing you have played before The star of this show is Phoenix Wright a lawyer who is new to the scene and must prove is worth with the Fey Co law offices As his first case you must take on a murder case as the defendant s lawyer In court you will have prove to the court that the defendant is not quilty by cross examining witness testimonies Your object is to find faults and contradictions in their testimony by referencing evidence and prior statements You can press them on everything they say to make them open up more about their testimony or to get them to confess more information The game doesn t stop there though after winning your first case you will go on to also investigate the crime scenes talk to witnesses and find your own evidence for your next case Think law and order but you will be handling both sides of the coin Sure there is a detective but he is a bit slow witted and quick to come to mis conclusions That is where you come in to further investigate all the missing gaps that the detective doesn t fill to use finding in the investigation to prove your defendant innocent later in court and to provide the court clarity as to what actually happened It plays like a puzzle adventure in that you must find clues and evidence and present them at the correct times to object to a testimony prove a contradiction or to trigger an event in a investigation in order to progress through the game These items are stored in your court record This game plays more like a interactive comic book and that is definitely not a bad thing Most of your time will be spent reading text I would say this takes up 75 of the game This doesn t hurt the game s score any because for 1 the game has a great story and is intriguing around every corner 2 the interaction between the characters is oft times funny and not at all dry It reads like a quality script written for a comic book or tv show The following 25 is interaction the ability to choose the right option or to present evidence at the right moment of the game This interaction goes seamless with the story and fits appropriately with the DS As the stylus is greatly utilized for presenting evidence out of your court record and exploring crime scenes There is a good reason why this makes most people s top ten DS list Graphics 3 5 out of 5 Although this game only consist of anime esque stylings of still life characters that are only slightly animated amongst static backgrounds the graphics still help carry the story It looks like the makings of slightly animated interactive comic book The character art is well drawn and each character changes looped animations based on their current mood However the graphics could easily have been shown on a lesser system such as the GBA Perhaps the graphics have been revamped and enhanced slightly for the DS version The only real thing that separates it from a GBA title is its use of stylus and its length Sound 4 out 5 good use of sound effects and use of music add suspense and drama to the game Gameplay 5 Story 5 Replay Value 3 Overall 4 5 A must for DS owners 
Games like this make the DS the 1 handheld Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney is a fun game It s that simple Graphics 4 out of 5 I would say the graphics are on par with most DS games They could be better but they don t retract at all from the gameplay They are fun and in the same style as games like Sprung and Under the Knife Audio 2 out of 5 The audio is where most DS games fall short I am content with the graphic abilities of the DS because quite simply the graphics don t make a good game Sure they help but the gameplay is were the entertainment truly lies It s knowing this that has kept Nintendo on top in the handheld market I just wish that the DS had a little more power behind it for the audio s sake I would like speaking characters throughout an entire game especially a game like this And the music is so repetetive it got to be so annoying that I found myself just turning the sound completely off I guess they do the best they can for what they have to work with but in this case it s just not good enough Gameplay 5 out of 5 As far as the gameplay goes you couldn t ask for a much better experience You are put in the role of Pheonix Wright who in his first trial is defending his best friend who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend Eventually you go on to work other cases and along the way you are required to gather evidence to use in court to suppport your defense The characters are over the top and a lot of fun to interact with This is a text based game and I suppose you might have to be a fan of the genre to really appreciate it But it s a simple pick up and play game that held my attention from beginning to end I really had trouble putting it down While a game like Sprung got a little monotonous and came down more to memorization then common sense questioning Phoenix stays on track in that area and logic plays more of a part in the solution of the cases I highly reccomend this game 
was exelente He was exelente but I continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the Spanish on the item Thus they tendrian but trade here in Venezuela without but one takes leave of you Emerson 
awsome controller people plz ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable 
Doesn t impress too much I like the 05 version better Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it doesn t appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much I won t buy the 07 when it comes out I ll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3 
it is a decent game the good it has fairly good graphics the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 didn t like the truck stick and nfl superstar the bad once you ve played this for awhile you ll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game it get old when you look into the crowd in a game the graphics suck it looks like a big blob of colors overall it is a really fun game i hope madden 07 will be better though 
very fun except superstar mode My expertise actually is in Rpg s but I ve always been a Madden fan so I think my opinion can be usefull to someone wanting to know about this game This is your classic madden game very fun very addictive and very challenging franchise mode is the best feature Basically you pick your team and then you decide how much to pay the players in order to keep under the salary cap which players to dump and rehire and pretty much everything else it takes to run a team which is a lot of things Then their is the online mode where you play players from all over the country After you play all of the other modes this feature can keep you entertained clear until the next madden game comes out The only problem is that some online players know how to cheat EA sports strongly denies that it s possible to cheat online and many good players get mad when someone talks about cheaters online because the good players think that people who blame other s for cheating are just sore losers which is true a lot of the time However after personally seeing some of the things my computer nerd brother can hack into and do I think anything is possible on any website There are a ton of people out there that are a lot smarter than you and me and they can figure out how to cheat at anything Finally the only reason that made me drop my rating from a 5 star overall to a 3 star overall The infamously not so popular superstar mode Super star mode sucks You have to retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr to get the pedigree parents you want On top of that you can t fully get your player to a high rating in all the categories that make a good player speed agility strenth etc You can improve the player s stats but never to where you eventually want to get them Also when you finally get an agent that get s you access to the performance institute it doesn t do much good because using the performance institue only increases your stat s temporarily But I have some good news I ve heard through the grapevine that in Madden 07 this feature will be greatly improved You ll be able to run the 40 yard dash so you can acually get a speed rating higher than a lousy 88 You get to do the bench rep to decide your own strength So at least in Madden 07 you ll have more control of your player s skills This is the best thing about Madden The people who make these Madden games must have took notes when they learned about evolution in school Every year Madden adapts and improves the flaws in last year s game much like what football coaches do with their team s in real life The cool thing is that they actually take advice from their fanbase Unlike most game companies When Madden comes across a problem they adapt and fix the problem This game probably deserved a 4 star overall rating instead of a 3 star overall rating but when a video game company adds a new feature to a game it better be cool Because it really pisses me off if they go through the trouble to add a new feature to get us all really excited and then the new feature ends up beeing stupid 
Very interesting This is a very interesting game Lots of places to explore Game Play is pretty smooth Sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot The game is very bookish With no cut scenes from the movie It can be fairly complicated at times With some strange moves to master Like flying shoes and umbrellas It s a fun game with good graphics 
Wow This is awesome After 8 hours of play so far I have gotten a lot more enjoyment out of this game than I did when reading the first three books of the series which themselves probably took less than 8 hours to read Where shall I begin describing this really fun game 1 The characters themselves are realistically animated and the Sunny animations are especially amusing with the way that she bites things squeals does little dances etc I ve smiled and laughed a lot just at how well the characters were represented 2 Voices are very good including the use of some of the major actors appearing in the upcoming film although their use is not pervasive during normal game play 3 The scenario is great fun far more involving than the books so far Playing the piano to break it apart and get it open was a real riot The settings are creepy with little roaches crawling about and rats and spiders and such 4 The game reaches the level of art Who did the soundtrack The music is AWESOME and wondrous After the dingy mansion of Count Olaf there are episodes of light relief that fill the player with a sense of peace and wonder the Library scene Uncle Monty s House and Garden The Garden with butterflies flapping by grass blowing wondrous music playing and the Big Tree adventure with Klaus flying over the greenery rivers etc finally made me see this video game as reaching a level of artistic accomplishment like a good painting to just get lost in and enjoy all the details and sensory input Wow And at first I was concerned that I might get through the game too quickly After 8 hours though and only being midway through I know I m getting my 40 worth for I will surely play through the whole thing more than once just as one watches a favorite video or takes a hike along a favorite forest path I calculate that at about 2 per hour this game is giving a far better return than seeing the film in the theater when it comes out although I plan to do that too And that s not even counting the game s resale value afterward In addition there are some special game features that tie in with the film with players eventually awarded with film photos information A V from and about the film One extra note to game players is that I don t think players will get a great deal of benefit from the BradyGuide to this game That game guide is poorly mapped and far from comprehensive while the instruction manual that comes in the game itself gives enough instruction and detail to allow players to start and proceed Save yourself 15 by avoiding the BradyGuide because a map you make yourself while playing will likely be far more useful Halfway through the game so far I only got about two useful tips from that guidebook and I would have figured those clues out on my own anyway 
My favorite PS2 game I love this game I haven t played other DDR games before so I m not sure how it compares to others but this one is great Some of the songs I like a lot and some I don t but they re all a challenge and fun in some way I like to use the Dance Master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well I haven t made it all that far because I play the same levels over and over again because they re so fun This game is great for people of all ages and includes music for the young and old 
Great Workout If you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a PS2 I would recommend this video game 
The Best I ve been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me San Andreas has got to be the best one For the first time you can swim I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character The graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you ll get used to it The language is terrible more so in this GTA version so young kids should avoid this like the plague 
a reason for its popularity There s a reason everyone loves this game there s a lot of exciting action The popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it s almost ridiculous Driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game It s a game you have to own if you re a fan of video games 
SCE always quality Whatever product Sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a Top Quality Product and these sony memory card for PS2 is just the perfect exampl 
Non serious gamer enjoys the xbox In late 04 I decided to give in and purchase THE gaming system at the time that was the original Xbox Having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on and never owned systems I had little knowledge of how it d be upon use but since Halo 2 had just been released to rave reviews I knew I had to try it out hey it s HALO people Man I was glad I invested in it It s a bit large compared to my best friend s PS2 and is a bit difficult to lug someplace but the graphics are much better than the PS2 and the games available for it are great significantly the critically acclaimed Halo series of course THE best game out there in my opinion There are some issues with how bulky the system is but it s about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is 
Melissa Dude Supy gave this game a bad review Supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games It is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the Lemony Snicket movie The game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you re not a very skilled gamer like my 6 year old it s okay because if you die you just restart the task I have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating 
Unfortunately Short and Easy Book Fans Don t listen to Dude Supy because he most likely hasn t read the books This game is very fun but doesn t last very long at all If you like the books you should rent it You probably won t want to buy it though I rented it yesterday and beat it today Very fun but not for long 
BRILLIANT I was quite unsure on whether to buy the film or not as i didn t think it was going to be my type of film But i bought the game anyway although i hadnt yet seen the film Anyway im glad i did It only took me two days to complete but although it isnt long long it is very good from beginning to end basically going round different rooms of the house doing different things which may seem borin actually it is really fun The activites etc are great it is definately a good game if you like the more adventurous games that arent too hard like me too hard games arent really my type Now i so cant wait to see the film which i recently bought 
Family Fun All the family have played this game and have had a blast Sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids The graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun We also own the movie 
needs to be cheaper I can t believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible So you re forced to shop for one online It s REALLY not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game It s really dumb 
Best PS2 memory card period There are a lot of different memory cards on the market for the PS2 but the official Sony 8mb memory card is by far the best card for your system Unlike other memory cards available this baby will not fail you That means you can depend on it at all times So to make a long story short do yourself a favor and buy this ever reliable memory card 
Great memory card highly overpriced This memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced I didn t have to worry about this because mine came with my PS2 It can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game If you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards If you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused The value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng 
Far Cry Video Game This game I purchased for my sons They both told me they enjoyed this game A little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges If you want a game that is not too easy this is the one Have fun and don t let losing take the fun away It is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills 
Brilliant intense gameplay and graphics make up for slightly lacking story After finishing both Half Life Episode I and The Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay over a few days I was looking for another fun first person shooter game that would let me pass away an hour or so a day and allow me to unwind by slaughtering a constant flow of enemies with high powered weapons without resulting in the actual murder of innocent people I d heard that Far Cry was pretty good so I bought it installed it and got ready to blast The first thing I noticed is the astonishing graphics engine It s without a doubt the most beautiful environment ever created for an FPS My jaw was on the floor for the first few hours checking out the ridiculously high detailed environment The outdoor scenery looks like a paradise holiday destination with crystal clear blue water and lush green jungle There is birdlife fish and a general feeling that you re running around a living breathing world One thing was very different right from the start and would play a major role in later missions There is no save game option There are checkpoints littered around the levels but it can occasionally be around 10 to 20 minutes of solid game play between them At first this just annoyed me since I found myself reloading over and over on some of the harder missions I couldn t just run into the fray firing my weapon left right and centre at anything that moves because one headshot would send me back a heck of a long way in some instances I was forced to change my style of play from all out assault to a stealthy crawling breath holding sweating nerve wracking approach I rediscovered the part of myself that loved Thief The Dark Project so very much all those years ago Yet I still got to combine that approach with levels of general carnage when it was simply unavoidable I am now a firm believer that the save game option should be removed from many other not all first person games out there as it raises the intensity level dramatically The story itself is fairly average and the dialogue even more so which is really what places Far Cry below the likes of Half Life You are basically just following instructions the entire game used as a violent killing machine with no real choices But for some reason I just didn t care as I was so absorbed by the surroundings and simply surviving that it didn t lower my enjoyment The enemies have very good AI flanking me whenever possible and generally actually trying to avoid being shot rather than running straight at me There are plenty of occasions though where an enemy will just stand there in the distance while you shoot them from plain sight but generally all is good The weapons are fantastic being both highly effective and satisfying to use The sniper rifle as always is a personal favourite and this game makes awesome use of it with massive maps of open ground While initially I was prepared for a standard Serious Sam type of game Far Cry turned out to be so much more Some fantastic graphics inspired level design forced variations of play and some fiercely intense gunfights make this game an absolute winner You can add value for money as well since there are 20 long missions to get through With no save option those 20 will take you a long time to complete But you will love it I sure did 
OMGWTF I m still a weakling Neat game but I shouldn t have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 The leveling system developer should have stayed off the crack pipe Also I m the Hero of Kavatch but I don t want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds The fact that I saved a town also apparently doesn t entitle me to even pick up an item if I don t own it w o being thrown in prison Very realistic 
My 5 Year Old Boy LOVES This Game My son loves this game We rented it first from Blockbuster and now he won t let us take it back so I ordered it from Amazon com so I can take the game back soon to Blockbuster I have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but I don t mind because it s FUN 
only a 1 player game We rented this game for my kids to play with each other The game is labeled 1 2 players but is made for only one player at a single PS2 console The kids are disappointed because now they have to take turns watching each other Be aware 
Xbox 360 is the best ever PS3 fans so sorry I must say I am a owner of a xbox and xbox 360 I will never and I repeat never buy another system The xbox360 clearly blows all the competition away Sony fans do not stand a chance With the best graphics and gameplay on the planet Microsoft is clearly 1 I have a first generation xbox 360 and have never had a problem to this day If you want a awesome system that works with your Media Center plays music cds display s pictures great gameplay both offline and online free demos maps characters and movies via the awesome xbox live then my friend this system is definately for you Thanks Bill Gates Now go make a hand held one 
superb I have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it Halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters They can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect 
The best overall package for next generation gaming I ve had my 360 since day one and it s been worth every dollar Let me start by saying there is NOTHING nothing that compares to Xbox Live on the 360 Microsoft knows online gaming they know the gamer By the end of the month you will be able to download High Def Movies for rent and tv shows for free The online community is set up to help guide you to gamers like yourself and people with your skill level Sony can t do this and Ninendo can t do this They will try but the Xbox has been doing this for years now starting with the original xbox As for the so called problems All systems have them in the first couple months of release it happenend to the Gamecube PS2 and as we are seeing the PS3 I do also want to mention that the poster who said not to put the 360 verticle does not have a clue You can put it verticle or horizontal and it works just fine As it turns out many systems were crashing because people got scared of the rumours and bought the nyko cooler It in turn is now being reported and back with pictures etc that IT was causing many 360 s to burn out and it had nothing to do with any 360 problems I personally have the 360 and soon a Nintendo Wii and I have to say in the overall scheme of things Games Online network options accessories etc You can t beat the Xbox 360 Not only that the sony hype machine wants to tell you that it s graphics are better In reality programmers and 3rd party developers are saying they are equal in graphical power but you are force fed lies and hype from the Sony side Not to mention a much higher price tag With all the bs sony and fanboys throw out there The 360 is a worthy buy You really can t go wrong with the 360 buy the premium and get the best game out there Gears of War 
Great Graphics Good Games but not bug free This is a Good system with great graphics and a number of good games Supports online multiplayer too with an xbox live subscription The only problem i have with the system is that sometimes it freezes i ve had it for about 5 months and it s probably frozen about 8 or 9 times which can be annoying esp when im in the middle of a game Other than that it s a good system 
Great game If your tired of all the first person shooters and RPGS This game rocks It was 1990 all over again for me Love the game Since i didnt have anm original playstation I can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me The only issue I have is that you cant play 2 player But i can forgive that 
Great Shooter Great shooter game Great graphics 100+ ship variation This game is five dollars at Toys R Us 
R Type makes it to the next gen consoles R Type Final 2004 INTRODUCTION Over the years Irem s R Type series has been one of the finest side scrolling space shooter series out there From its dawn in the eighties to the modern age the series has always pleased its fans serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike Many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike In 2004 the series finally hit the big consoles of the era The Playstation Two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive R Type Final How did this new modernized version of the series fare Read on and find out OVERVIEW R Type Final was released for the Playstation Two gaming console in early 2004 The game features a number of different gameplay modes configurations vehicles and other variables to keep things interesting The game is a product of the Irem Corporation REVIEW I have always loved the R Type series and I was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment And after finally giving the game a whirl I must say for the most part I am impressed The game stays true to its roots while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh Let s see where this game succeeds and where it falls flat THE GOOD CLASSIC STYLE R TYPE GAMEPLAY If you ve played any other game in this series you ll pick this one up right away The game plays similar in style to its predecessors and as such is very easy to learn if you ve played any other game the series has to offer LOTS OF NEW ELEMENTS THROWN INTO THE EXPERIENCE When you start the game you ll have your choice of three ships but you can unlock more there are over a hundred ships total The game also features plenty of new weaponry and power up items If you play the game heavily it s going to reward you well CHALLENGING If you re looking for a challenge you ve come to the right place This game serves up its fair share of challenging elements and it never lets up Even game masters will be challenged CONTROLS ARE EASY TO LEARN AND EFFECTIVE If you played any installment of the series on the Super Nintendo you ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme THE BAD DESPITE ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IT S STILL THE SAME GAME Even though I like all the improvements this game has made to the series at heart it s still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago If you didn t like the series then this new installment isn t going to change your mind NO IMMEDIATE REGENERATION WHEN KILLED This has always been a huge flaw of this series and I am disappointed to see that this wasn t fixed In most space shooters you regenerate immediately after you die right where you died Not the case with this series GRAPHICS AREN T THAT GREAT FOR A NEXT GENERATION GAME Granted the gameplay is the most important thing here but still I think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available OVERALL Despite the obvious issues this is one of the best versions of R Type I have played to date If you re a big time fan of this series this installment is well worth checking out If you re not a fan though this one isn t going to change your mind Still if you are one of the many R Type fans out there don t hesitate to give this one a whirl EDITION NOTES This game it seems wasn t produced for a very lengthy period of time As such it seems to be rather difficult to come by You re probably going to have to order it online or check around in used game stores This one is tough to come by new 
R Type Final I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters so take this opinion with that in mind The only problem with R Type is that dying sucks When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups Once you unlock free play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc However overall I think it s the best of the R types and one of the better side scrollers out there 
cooking fun I am 23 years old and this game hasn t left my DS since I bought it a month ago It s incredibly fun I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames You get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking I love these weird japanese games I only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes I heard they are making a Wii version of cooking mama so I m hoping that one will have more recipes 
Fun game When I first came home with this game and tried it I thought it was going to be kind of dumb But it is lots of fun and kind of addicting I even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking Plus it is a good price 
A great Arcade Game Boy the folks at EA really outdone themselves this time Just when I thought 2003 was the greatest NCAA ARCADE game ever EA releases NCAA 2006 This blows 2003 out the water I never knew it could be sooo much fun having the CPU complete 80 Yard TD pass every single time Nor did I know that the bomb is the most acurate pass in the game Who needs realism in a football sim when you can just bomb the ball down field and have it be on target every single time This game punishes you for trying to play like a real football game so why not just bomb it every time If your receiver drops a wide open 5 yard pass that just means he wants you to throw it 60 yards down the field and he ll have a much better chance of catching it Where else can you find a game where QB s constantly break tackles spin on one foot and throw a perfect spiral 40 yards down the field right on target ITS IN THE GAME WOW I love how RB s can break 7 tackles on there way to a 81 yard TD run Oh yeah those safeties are beasts They apparantly have a very strong gravitational pull which causes your TE and OL to completely ignore the D Linemen and linebackers and run to block the safeties who are not even in the play Every safety should be in the NFL if they are able to do that WOW Oh and don t forget about the kickers Only in an arcade game can a mid 70 s rated kickers can drill 50+ yard FGs against the wind with 10 yards to spare every single time And if you don t believe that this is a great Arcade game check out the scoring of my latest game Sexton threw 6 picks yet still had the composure to throw 6 TD passes and for nearly 500 yards on only 13 passes WOW IT REALLY IS IN THE GAME 
A must have football game I m 36 years old and I have played many football video games on many different consoles over the years and I must say that this game stands out above all of the rest There are a zillion college teams to choose from The stadiums are beautifully detailed The players coaches and referee models and their animations are superb When playing in a stadium with a natural grass surface your players get grass and mud stains on their uniforms A friend of mine at my workplace that has had this game longer than I have says that occasionally a player s helmet will fly off after a big hit I have yet to see it happen but I m looking forward to it The crowds look and sound truly alive The fans celebrate and hold up signs The cheerleaders and even the teams mascot look fantastically detailed and their celebrations are exciting The ESPN College Gameday crew Brad Nessler Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit provide interesting and funny in game commentary with some but not much repetitiveness It s pretty cool when Corso makes his winning pick in the Gameday booth before the game he will be wearing either his picks mascot head or the teams football helmet as he s speaking Overall the gameplay is great and the learning curve is fairly easy especially if you re familiar with the Madden series On NCAA 2006 you can adjust your game settings etc any way you like and reset them to the default with the touch of a button I m not much into all of the different options that many sports games have such as creating teams players playbooks making coaching decisions and such although you can do all of that on this game I play solely for the visual and atmospheric stimulation which this game in particular provides In my opinion NCAA Football 2006 blows other football titles out of the water as it is the TOTAL PACKAGE Football fans GET THIS GAME You will feel like you are involved in an actual college football game complete with all of the emotion and pageantry You will become addicted to it and you will want to play it over and over again 
Great Game I purchased this game for my son and he loves it He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars I m glad that we selected this game for him he also has Underground Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also 
No Title NFSU does capture the idea of building and racing cars but I think they could go a little further into the design of your so called pimp mobile The only interior you get to design is the trunk I think they could at least do the seats or the wheel Outside design is A OK Anything from sideskirts to multi colored vinyels you make your car fierce The plot line in single player mode really dosen t go that deep your just some guy who wants to get his title back In multi player you race your own cars in tracks you already won but the down side is the whole graphics in two player is horrible It is a game worth getting but you might sell it later on 
A good deal despite a few problems I recently bought this wheel at a local Game Crazy in anticipation of the upcoming release of Gran Turismo 4 and so far despite a few problems i ve been satisfied with my purchase The Good 1 Great compatibility with PS2 racing titles it works with basically all PS1 and PS2 racing games not just Nascar games I ve been using it primarily with Gran Turismo 3 2 Easy control customization 3 Feels good in your hands 4 Well made The Bad 1 I wish the adjustable lap rest could lock into place sometimes it slips back in when your taking a tough corner 2 While the pedals are well made do not use them on a carpeted surface they slip Customize the wheel like i did setting the gas and brake to L1 and R1 and dont even bother with the pedels unless you have a better surface for them 3 The wheel allows customization of it s sensitivity but i wish it could get a little more sensitive then it can more life like Overall it s a good solid purchase if you can t afford to drop a 150 bucks on something top of the line It s definately alot better then using a controller on a racing game 
trust nintendo brand good and comfortable controller better than the N64 ones were It works much better than a 3rd party controller such as madcatz If you plan to or have played super smash brothers melee great game you will notice how much easier it is to pull off moves with a nintendo brand controller It is worth the extra money no matter what it says on the third party company s package dont be fooled by a third party controllers extra button the M button it does nothing because a nintendo brand controller doesnt have one and developers design games according to nintendo brand controllers I never use my cheap madcatz controller madcatz controller often malfunctions as well this one is much better and black goes with everything My rule of thumb Nintendo brand game accessories are more reliable longer lasting eye appealing and overall better than third party distributers please vote yes if I helped 
Best controller yet Gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 Xbox and PS2 s controllers have buttons that are the same size it s really confusing really On Gamecube s you know the A buttons the big one B s the small one and X and y are the kidney shaped ones Hard to tell them apart right 
Quality Why mess with the original There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount You get what you pay for I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won t have to learn a completely new system 
Outstanding The Nintendo DS is outstanding It makes playing games and communicating a breeze 
This is a great system please read it will help This is truly a good system Iv e sat on it dropped it kicked it thrashed it and it still is working fine I did consider buying the psp at first but then i thought I have an ipod nano a dvd player and a laptop I didn t see the point for having 2 of the above Also honsetly who would want to go on the web with a slow psp CAn you imagine how hard it is to type Anyway the games i recommend for the nds is mario kart ds animal crossing megaman battle network five and for people that are reall hard core gamers spiderman this is an extrmeley har game trust me Also i do find picto chat quite usless 33ft range isn t enough Also i was reading the psp reviews and about 85 percent of them said that the psp is for more mature gamers What got me is that alot of kid reviews were saying that All these kids playing M rated games is sorta scary but that s just my opion Also if you have the fat ds dont buy a ds lite Thres no need unless your eyesight is bad All it has is a brighter screen and a sleeker design So it s not werth it Once again this is only my opion im just giving my advice The wifi feature is pretty cool I am aware that psp has this too by the way Anyway mario kart ds does a great job usuing wi fi The feeling of sitting in your room playing with people across the world on this handheld is quite an extroindary feeling Well all in all if you really need a gaming device with good grapghics and multi media features get the psp But im warning you it is very very fragile If you have a music device and a computer and just want a good gaming system with great games and is very durable get nds They are both good systems just think about what you need in a system Do you want a gaming device or a multimedia device Its your choice in the end I hope this review has helped I just want to make your shopping a tad bit easiers Cheers Hisham Amery 
brain age I am using brainage game with this Very challenging and I have improved my performance 
PSP AND DS BOTH RULE will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both 
xbox its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time Same differance with highspeed and dialup If you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally I like my 360 remote 
A review to clear up some details I put a great deal of interest in my purchases With a lot of extra down time at work and an internet connection I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card But this product the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway Let me tell you This remote is PERFECT if 1 You would like one easy to use remote to control both basic TV and an Xbox 360 that doubles as your DVD player 2 The only buttons you would need for the TV are Channels Volume TV speaker output control only Numerical channel input Muting INTPUT SELECTION yes it CAN switch between your TV s inputs Return to toggle between 2 TV channels and Power 3 You do not need specialized advanced buttons found on a OEM remote or advanced learning remote for the TV 4 You do not need to control a A V receiver DVD player other than XBOX 360 or a digital cable box Tivo DVR etc 5 You are on a budget but would still like a quality remote If you can say yes to all or most then don t hesitate to grab one of these remotes You will be completely satisfied Especially with immediate access to the tactile DVD buttons versus the 360 s annoying on screen DVD navigation For this feature it is almost worth the 30 alone P S I also own a Logitech Harmony 880 for the living room which I highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above 
For the hardcore only The classic Final Fantasy games 1 3 not 6 are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon Then you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs Potions and Ethers just to kill ONE monster For example the Behemoths found past B5 in the center of the moon and in Bahamuts cave will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member Most of the boss fights Asura Bahamut and tough monsters Behemoths Wicked Masks are gimmick fights Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game just cast Reflect on all of your party members Let me reinstate what the previous reviewers have said about this game + Crisp graphics + Great music + sound + Fun + More to do once you beat the game Somewhat short beat EG Zeromus in 18hrs 42mins Very difficult Prepare to grind 10 15 levels once you reach the center of the moon I enjoyed this and you can bet I m getting FF3 for the DS Great blast from the past a must buy for any Final Fantasy fan RPG lover or GBA owner 
Final Fantasy IV Advance Leave it to me to start into a series in its second third or fourth installments In this case it s the fourth Course there s a good explanation why I set out looking for Final Fantasy I II Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance Hey if you re going to collect a series it s a good thing to start at the beginning at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead There isn t much that I can say that hasn t already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance The story goes like this The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals The commander of its air force Cecil has been dismissed after questioning the king s motives With the help of others Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and in the meantime uncovers a far more dangerous one It s a deep story with alot of twists and turns is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system I can t recommend this game enough It s one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy games Although they tweaked the graphics translation and whatnot abit they pretty much made the game as it was originally I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one 
After 15 Years Bards are Still Spoony Here is a blast of nostalgia for your Gameboy Advance Final Fantasy IV Advance aka Final Fantasy II aka Final Fantasy IV Hard Type is a treat for old school RPG players Back in its hayday Final Fantasy IV was the gold standard for what an RPG should be The first in a series of remakes of that wonderful streak that was the SNES Final Fantasies Final Fantasy IV is back and better than ever The story is as good as it ever was Final Fantasy 4 did what Final Fantasy 2 Japanese numbering tried to do mixed a well developed story with memorable characters with good if simple gameplay This is the story of Cecil the Dark Knight who renounces his loyalty to the corrupt kingdom of Baron Baron has been making war against the other nations of the world to capture four elemental crystals When his king commands him to kill the innocent Cecil sets out on a quest to make things right that will take him around the world to the center of the earth and to the moon As he unravels the mystery of who is really behind the actions of Baron he is joined by a cast of over ten playable characters Each of them has a reason to join the fight Characterization may not seem much by today s standards but this game was made in an age when Square believed less was more You revealed a motive once and then you moved on instead of going over and over the same psychological problem again and again Unlike the Playstation port that had absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script FF4Advance has a few minor visual tweaks Some of the game sprites seem to have been tweaked abit to have more definition and character portraits have been redrawn and put in the dialogue boxes to indicate who is speaking Most of the new portraits are fairly close to the old ones Edge s and Rydia s are actually an improvement but the new one s for Rosa Paladin Cecil and Edward in particular aren t so nice to look at There are also two new dungeons and the ability to tackle the final boss with any of the other still living playable characters than with the fixed party of five like in the original All of these new features are very unobtrusive so you can take advantage of them if you d like the extra challenge or ignore them altogether Instead of using the script from the original release that contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes and was censored due to Nintendo of America s then extremely strict guidelines FF4A contains a more accurate revamped version Of course the You spoony bard line has thankfully been left intact It s a classic If not for one issue I d say that this is undoubtedly the best version of the game available Final Fantasy IV was a really hard game FF4A is not that hard at all at least early in the game I don t know if the difficulty was scaled back because they thought that people didn t want to waste GBA battery life on hours of leveling up or because I ve played this game many times before but it just seemed too easy Anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember at least super tough boss battle be it Baigan the Magnus Sisters Evil Wall or something else This time through they where like a cake walk Also it seems that the Active Time Battle is set up in such a way as it gives your party the advantage Your party seems to regain their turns twice as fast as the enemy About half way through the game that legendary difficulty starts creeping back and by the final trek to the core of the moon you ll be thankful for any break the game will give you Final Fantasy IV shows in this port that it stands the test of time Instead of feeling hoary old and outdated it feels just as much fun as it was fifteen years ago 
A GREAT REMAKE When I heard that Square was going to remake Final Fantasy IV originally Final Fantasy II in the U S I was very excited This game is considered to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy games of all time All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy fan 
The heart of action games for the past present and future Half Life made its debut in 1998 and it shocked the entire world Half Life at the time featured stunning graphics gameplay and sound It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands and still to this date Half Life is a game that every action game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again but made it scream The game pits terrorists and counter terrorists in a fast paced sort of S W A T type of tactical firefighting gameplay Matches can consist of one of two types of game types The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal In both of the game types you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it Once the bomb is planted the counter terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated The counter terrorists usually have about thirty five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round The second type of gameplay is hostage rescue The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter terrorists nothing will happen except that now the counter terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style All of the weapons in the game are one hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality This is an element that makes Counter Strike such a superior game Counter Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world An entire culture has formed around it So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game It is purely because of the fantastically well crafted gameplay and not the graphics or the game would not be as popular as it is Players around the world will give you many deep reasons why it is such a great game But one without argument stands out It is simply the fact that versus other games it is difficult to make a kill in the game What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated it has been superiorly well done And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically a feeling of power will be experienced when holding an AK 47 or an M4 The game is quite punishing to new players and a total hapzard to players who have never played first person shooters or video games at all But regardless the stress you feel at first there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry difficulty as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game There are over ten maps in the game and each one has been done as a masterpiece All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment The most popular of all the maps de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies magazines shows etc Due to its style and simplicity it is a godly designed map and arguably the most popular map in first person shooter history One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps Since each map has been superbly designed a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play and with a different feel The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers This makes Counter Strike a game with an almost infinite value sort of feel The sound in Counter Strike is absolutely insanely realistic The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK 47 fire or pistol fire Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic and the player s best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of power This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game At the time Counter Strike had simply jaw dropping graphics Created all from the Half Life engine players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were At the present the game doesn t hold the same but it is what in the past has mattered Half Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at Games before the release of Half Life hardly had any sort of physics and if they did it would be something very basic Counter Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player s hard drive There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998 still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom Counter Strike will forever be played and is the heart of all action games from the past present and the future 
Old game yet popular today Ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular Fps First person shooter games out there Ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that I know still play cs today like myself From planting bombs to rescuing hostages you ll find this game enjoyable There are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 The screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers If your looking for a great fps game this is it = 
It really is the best game ever made In the April 2005 PC Gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time Half Life was 1 This is basically a sequel to that game VERY fun except when you re in a server with hackers in it Just make sure to never give your CD key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it For version 1 6 Then go to Browse games and register your CD key Once you do that you won t be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years 
please please PLEASE play this game for more than an hour I always hear these things mainly of the point that it s unrealistic noone uses teamwork people are too preoccupied with their stats etc etc THAT may be true on many public servers though there are quite a few that aren t filled with morons and actually have people who play in a teamlike fashion and complete their objective over killing off the enemy in the time given I am one of those people who actually go for the objective And actually i am an admin at a server and if a terrorist is last and is camping out the round then i will slay him and warn him to stay on task Onto another point many people claim this to be so unrealistic it may be true on points like the M249 being a slow shooter very cumbersome and has too good aim for standing up and the fact that you die from 2 shots in the toe with the AWP those are all unrealistic points BUT if you think about it how much fun would it be to have to unload 5 clips and a half to killt he enemy COUGH HALO COUGH yes i just insulted halo because the enemies are too damn strong it drives me crazy along with the multiplayer being so annoying that you shoot the enemy with 3 shots from a sniper to kill And my final point is that there are people who aren t just preoccupied with their stats there are servers dedicated to having fun Yes fun on a counterstrike They will have a whole slew of crazy maps ways to make it even more insane and things such as that If you are interested in that try custom map servers ALL IN ALL This game is at a peak of perfection not even mentioning the huge amounts of customization involved in this game from weapons to player models 
I LOVE SHAMU 11 This game looks like so much fun I mean seriously who wouldn t want to play as Shamu and swim around and stuff I am very disappointed in the lack of screenshots and videos I really think this game has potential I ve been a huge fan of Shamu ever since I was a little kid Every summer when me and my family go to San Diego on vacation we always go and see him I have at least ten Shamu stuffed animals on my bed Anyways I m really looking forward to this game Think about it how many games allow you to go underwater and swim around as a creature that s home is the deep blue sea None With this game I won t have to get my stuffed animals all wet when I take them in my bath with me and play around Now if I want to pretend to be Shamu all I have to do is turn on my Gamecube Ya see if this game is advertised correctly it will definitely be one of the best games of the year We need to spread the work about this 
It s Madden football nothing more There s a lot of different opinions of Madden NFL 07 swirling around so I figured I get in on it as well For my money to just have a new football game is worth it Seeing as how Madden is now the only football game available from year to year if you don t like Madden s brand of video games then I feel so sorry for you However I think this is a great installment By no means is this the best released but there s no doubt that it s a lot of fun Have Madden 06 You basically have 07 Not a lot has changed from last year The few things are the running options juking and whatnot being moved to the right joystick the 50 yard dash on the training camp and the new camera angle for your Superstar linebacker Also while I ve only played a quarter of an exhibition game and a lot of Superstar games I still have yet to hear John Madden I don t know if he s not on this game or not but if he isn t that just makes no sense Pros It s still Madden Linebacker view Overall Superstar Hall Of Fame feature Having all the big name rookies is kind of nice Cons It hasn t changed much from last year Yeah that s my only big complaint I can t help but love this game though If you re looking to save money then there s no huge reason to buy this unless you HAVE to play with Leinart Young Bush and Williams then by all means check this out However if not having those guys doesn t bother you then you really don t need this year s game 
Fun but short I liked this game especially with Kris Kristofferson doing Ned s voice Should have had more of him in it Gameplay is short I beat it in less than a day I liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this 
GET THIS GAME You will not be dissapointed by buying this game If you like RPGs Action and or Adventure games you ll love this one There is soooooo much to do Even after you ve beat the game With the huge maps tons of free roaming space and exciting side missions you can play for hours without even starting the main mission The sound and graphics are just about the best I ve ever seen The mian story is also awesome It s easy to follow and tons of fun to play Buy this 
It s over already I m going to keep this short because the game doesn t deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and SHORT my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it 
Great Machine but just keeps crashing Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze No biggie Then it died No problem sent it in for repairs under warranty Free of charge Cool Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM Ring of Death Warranty over 130 140 dollars to fix Yay I think I m going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects 
Best system for gaming hands down The next gen console wars are now officially in full swing with the release of the PS3 and Wii So that leaves everyone with the decision of choosing the right system I ll start with saying that the Wii fits a different demographic than the PS3 and 360 perhaps a gamer looking for something different or perhaps a system for a family with young ones Also if you want to try to get your girlfriend to play games with you this system would be the one to do it To me it makes a good second console but for the hardcore gamer this is not going to satisfy as a core gaming machine The real battle for the traditional hardcore gamer market is between the 360 and the PS3 I own a 360 and have followed the PS3 closely until release and have played it The two systems are very close in power regardless of what Sony s marketing hype and brainwashing tactics might lead you to believe The Cell processor cannot slice bread and let s just leave it at that Currently the better library belongs to the 360 It has more AAA titles than the PS3 and it will remain that way throughout 2007 The Xbox 360 simply has a better lineup Gears of War is one of the best games you will ever play it is incredible in every way and features new gameplay mechanics that make it more than just another cookie cutter shooter like Resistance I would call Resistance a very good game but Gears is a truly great game Lost Planet exclusive to Xbox will follow this up in early 2007 with more 3rd person shooting action If you have not seen this game prepare to be amazed RPGs are covered with Oblivion the upcoming galactic epic Mass Effect and the eerie underwater adventure RPG BioShock Alan Wake is another hit in the making along with Too Human from talented developer Silicon Knights That is a lot of brand new IPs for the 360 Sony no longer has a hold on Grand Theft Auto and we will see GTA4 in 2007 debut on the 360 at the same time as PS3 Add to that better versions of the Tom Clancy games since the primary development platform is the 360 for those franchises Racing Got the sequel to the acclaimed Forza Motorsport Finally what better way to end 2007 than with Halo 3 If you simply must have the new Metal Gear and Devil May Cry the PS3 is for you I am tired of those games not to mention Final Fantasy XIXXIXV The 360 offers what I see as the best gaming experience refreshing new titles sequels to legacy Xbox titles amazing graphical power and the most comfortable controller on the market Not only that it s cheaper to boot 
Xbox 360 is the best ever PS3 fans so sorry I must say I am a owner of a xbox and xbox 360 I will never and I repeat never buy another system The xbox360 clearly blows all the competition away Sony fans do not stand a chance With the best graphics and gameplay on the planet Microsoft is clearly 1 I have a first generation xbox 360 and have never had a problem to this day If you want a awesome system that works with your Media Center plays music cds display s pictures great gameplay both offline and online free demos maps characters and movies via the awesome xbox live then my friend this system is definately for you Thanks Bill Gates Now go make a hand held one 
superb I have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it Halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters They can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect 
We NEED Katamari Not only is We Love Katamari way better then the first but you get to play the prince s cousins Some of the cousins are faster some are slower some seem stronger then others Also some of the Katamari s have earth elements such as a big snowball Katamari a fireball one too The fireball is kind of tricky you have to keep the fire on it burning if not the level fails also watch out for the water it will put it out no matter how big it is Last but not least to finish We Love Katamari you need to convert your progress from Katamari Damacy to this one If you did delete the first one from you memory card then to bad you ll have to play the first all over again 
You ll never get tired of this game This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play You don t exactly finish it like other video games but are always trying to beat your fastest time so it doesn t get old as fast As a matter of fact we wore out our last copy and this is our second I love it and I m the parent My kids and I play it together and cheer each other on The only thing I would change is make the two player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally I would keep them in the corner instead Overall highly recommend this game More than your money s worth 
My two cents rolled up into a Katamari This is another praise for the game rolled into the other praises By now you ve read the synopsis by others your character the Prince or one of his cousins rolls an orb i e Katamari which collects every object in the level This game works on many levels it is first and foremost absurd and bewildering The introductory animations and cut scenes are off the wall yet amusing The incessant rolling is cathartic and addictive the bonuses involve finding hidden presents and cousins in the level There are many variations on the rolling theme in the game roll a sumo wrestler into food roll a snowball onto a snowman roll fireflies into a kid s reading light time trials etc but the most satisfying is the original premise of rolling everything and anything into as large a ball as possible Once you start to consume people trucks skyscrapers ships clouds etc then you feel very powerful Music is very catchy something vacant from many video games My only criticism the cooperative two player mode can venture into frustration quite easily My wife and I played who are both good at the game but you often find yourself awkwardly and slowing moving where you want And that s part of the problem where you want to roll may not be where the other person wants to roll so communicate well 
I love to roll hit This game is a lot of fun The level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music isn t as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days 
Best Headset To Date This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis 
Awesome This headset is way better than the X Box one considering the X Box one broke in a hurry The sound quality is awesome and you don t get any annoying breathing in the mic Pick this one up 
Much better than the other headset While I did not have to spend retail on this headset I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay I did have to buy the communicator which can be found on gamestop com and it was still worth the money It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you While it is not worth 50 if you can get it as part of a deal with something else by all means do it Note I said this before in my review but the Communicator can be found on gamestop com or on Amazon if you type Xbox Live Communicato 
Great game cant wait for the second one I love this game and i ve been playing it every since it came out Its not one of those boring after a while Pros Good graphics Good gameplay Lots of mechs Live support Content download A LOT up to 8 people on xbox live lots of missions Cons Can get a bit repetetiv 
Mass Destruction O Yeah Baby MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again No Not if you have Xbox Live In Live you can play Capture The Flag download new Mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more If you don t have Xbox Live or a system link that your wasting your money 
Doom 3 very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i couldn t stop playing it 
Good but not as great or revolutionary as it should have been I remember when Doom 3 first came out there was a lot of hype on the Internet People were claiming it would blow away the release of Half Life 2 with id s new engine etc etc etc Unfortunately Doom 3 is a rather standard shoot em up It s fun for a little while but it lacks the originality and inventiveness of games like Half Life 2 which was amazing Half Life kept me engaged because the terrain changes the characters change and so on In Doom 3 it s basically just a lot of walking around through dimly lit corridors Monsters jump out and you kill them It s fun for a while but then it becomes tiring much like a haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight Furthermore the graphics engine really isn t what everyone made it out to be I just bought a new PC this year and it runs this game very well on maximum settings the gameplay isn t choppy or anything But even at full potential with graphics I think they re just OK The shadowing is brilliant but the textures are average and some of the characters in the cut scenes are downright laughable one of the Commanders early on looks like a character from AvP 2 and that game came out in 2001 The in game play is much better characters look more realistic but I have to wonder what the rush was with the cut scenes One would think they d spend more attention to detail on these Overall I have to admit that while I found this fun at times it gets tedious after a while I mean the gimmick with the flashlight is annoying as someone else pointed out I think in the beginning it s okay but they should have planted an upgrade early on in the game such as a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top or nightvision goggles that last for a minute or two before they have to be recharged because dropping your flashlight and picking up a weapon while you re being shot at by enemies is annoying And as another reviewer pointed out the PDA gimmick gets old fast Overall this has moments of absolute brilliance but I felt like so much more could have been done with it They should have abandoned the concept of being alone in the dark throughout the entire game and done a bit more with it I would have loved to have explored the Martian planet more or even levels that don t look exactly the same Because the repetitive nature of the game is ultimately what sinks it It s good but I think Half Life 2 was far better and the graphics engine on HL was stunning even two years later 
Don t let stingey reviews deter you from this game A brilliant remake of the original classic Although I am an avid fan of the first DOOM I strongly urge you to NOT juxtapose the two If you sit back and pick apart the differences between them you ll never enjoy DOOM 3 Why is this game well worth the buy Many reasons Superb graphics is the first that you ll notice The environment is rich and detailed Don t worry about whether or not your computer can handle it You can easily build one that is easily capable at running the game with full settings for less than 900 and if you re comp is so old that you can t run it like this you may have been due for an upgrade anyways The weapons are great and very realistic Like the real world your arsenal must be reloaded after so many rounds are fired A handy pair of digits will help you monitor your clip and total ammo for any weapon though So plan ahead and keep your guns fully loaded As for the endless series of hallways that some people are complaining about it makes absolutely no sense to have a stadium set up on a Mars Research Base The game offers plenty of larger rooms to adequately utilize heavier weapons such as the rocket launcher without blowing your own face off The ambient sounds of the game are more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat Dead bodies will randomly levitate and fly across the room grates will be knocked around be unseen forces and Betruger s haunting laugh will often accompany many of these ghostly actions and more The enemies are fierce the enemies are bad as in fearful any one of them can go from easy to kill to downright lethal You may not get very many good looks at them but you really shouldn t be trying to admire the pixels of something that s trying to kill you Take a screenshot and look at that later if you want to take in what the monsters look like Experiment with your arsenal learn the best weapon for the job and conserving ammo won t be a problem at all The big issue that most people seem to have is that of lighting Yes in the 22nd century you d expect Marines to have lights mounted on their weapons ID Software isn t stupid a flashlight on all of your guns would have made the game a lot easier and a lot less fun By switching from your light to your gun the game forces you to choose between being able to see the enemy and being able to attack the enemy Remember this game is of the Horror genre And horror thrives on you asking questions like Where is it What is it Where is it gonna pop out at next Go rent a horror movie and you ll see what I mean It s dark DOOM 3 is meant to be like this Buy the game or borrow it from a buddy Turns the lights off and turn the volume up If you like horror it will pull you right in 
A short criteria so s not to bore you I ve been through Doom3 now three times The first time I didn t even cheat I won t go into how great a game it is but will stick to the few short comings One the game started off perfect A little bit of realism goes a long way but later on degraded into a world of comic bookish nightmareism skeletons with missile launchers on their shoulders come on The bugger man with a rocket launcher in pace of a right hand AAAH It isn t hard to figure out why ID did it they were trying to spice it up a bit to keep it interesting I understand I just don t agree Two no mass attacks by monsters to use up all your hard won ammunition Instead you transport our marine to h ll to once more search for and find the same things all over again all these games do that A monster with a nazi helmet and whip more comic book filler Three a game that has to cheat in every other room searched gets a little irritating You know the monster is on the other side of that darkened doorway You throw a dozen gernades in there the monster isn t hurt You take that step forward the monster jumps out and you blast it And then of course the monster which appeared out of nowhere behind you attacks The answer of course is walk backward trip the If Then statment in the program shoot the monster behind and turn around and shoot the one in front on your second attempt to get through the door I do get tired of computer gamecheating because I makes me have to cheat to beat the game I don t mind the dark areas the whole base just went to h ll I would expect the lights not to always work Four I ve heard those h ll Knights have to be destroyed with that big green glowing plasma gun cannon Well I did it with thirty eight hand grenades The game would have been I think better if two or three had been turn loose to roam the hallways looking for humans to munch on randomly Five basically never enough fighting room Understandable for a station on another world with pressurized atmosphere Rooms would all be small Exploding barrels in pressurized enviroment what a hoot Yuck yes I said Yuck instead of the number belted ammunition for machineguns usually came in 100 round belts not sixty Mini guns used chained belts I know I use to repair them The plasma gun s munitions travel far too slow The shotgun needs a longer barrel so it still has a choke to keep the pellets from spread out too wide and becoming useless after ten feet Handgrenades can t be thrown properly Light machinegun s firing rate is half what it should be and for goodiness sake get some duck tape for that flashlight and tape to you weapon The list could go on for these little things but the game is easily worth the money Remember these are mostly suggestions for ID future program 
Awesome pack for the price Let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about CompDude being off track The keys are in there I found all four of these games to be great I haven t gotten into the LOTR one yet because it s graphics intensive and I have a laptop The other three games are cool too For the price it s a great deal compare to buying the titles individually 
A great bargain I was looking for the Black and White Deluxe Version with expansion pack and came across this I was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews by Computer Dude said none of the games have activation numbers Let me start by saying that this is not true This is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games really five including the Black and White expansion pack and on the back were all five activation numbers I installed Black and White without any problems and was up half the night playing it The only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation manuals etc except for the four page installation guide are on the game CDs So if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate 
Don t listen to the nay sayers I can only assume that the handful of people rating this game with one star out of five are GTA fanboys or total curmudgeons Forget comparisons with GTA Yes some of the open world gameplay elements are familiar But this is basically a Tony Montana Simulator and THAT S the very considerable USP of the game It s all about What Would Tony Do The conversations are hilarious the gunplay is great the vehicle physics are solid the drug wars game adds an extra layer of strategy and some interesting choices Sure there are some periods where game events hit a bit of a lull but most other games GTA in particular are guilty of this And at its best this game is an absolute blast Aside from the decent core mechanics the game will MAKE YOU LAUGH constantly which is no small consideration it s consistently entertaining even when you re NOT busy with a mission and you can t ask for much more than that 
Great Game This game is truly worth the wait It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in The cars handle great and are a blast to drive The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome This is a must get game 
A really FUN game my favorite so far I picked this up along with Zelda when buying the Wii This game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is SO FUN I love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road The action is fast and the driving is very intuitive provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts It s not too hard anyone can play and it s just fun I love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me Highly Recommended don t overlook this game 
good game this game is better than madden by a nose but could be better gameplay is better than madden i think 
A Barnburner from College Football Fans I ve been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now and here are my thoughts 1 The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it s sport as any other game Anyone who has been to a big time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake 2 I did not play the career mode I simply prefer control over the whole program 3 Gameplay is very strong anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls 4 I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks 5 Likewise I could do without the auto slo motion on key plays It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play EA that s what replay is for 6 The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties not just on TD s but simple catches or defensive plays 7 You now have more control over recruiting with in season recruiting including mulitple pitches and on campus visits 8 After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables Changing the logo or the sponsor does not a new unlockable make 
Fun Video Game Art No other game looks or plays like this The missions and locations are varied and colorful The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials And as usual Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating Lots of unlockables offer high replay This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru The story is straightforward and engaging Lots of really interesting concepts machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole dead eye thing and it controls very well Another great game from an outstanding company Hopefully a sequel is in the works 
no bad good game this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49 99 buy this game cause they copied it 
mind blowing limb losing seriosly a guy loses an arm action im a western fanatic i just love the wild west I try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is AWESOME i cant wait for the new western game GUN coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying

A New Breed of Action Splinter Cell is the first in a series of three amazing games to date It is available for the XBOX PS2 Game Cube PC and Game Boy Advance Set in 2003 you play as Sam Fisher an elite operative gathering intelligence for Third Echelon a top secret initiative of the NSA National Security Administration You work alone during your missions with the support of a remote team who periodically feed you info and guidance throughout the missions If you are caught by the enemy your country will deny your existence and any connection to you Like a sliver of glass small sharp and nearly invisible you are a Splinter Cell Splinter Cell is now highly renowned as being the ground breaking game that introduced the world to true stealth gaming Light and shadows are the key elements in the game and play a vital role to your success Unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing in Splinter Cell you must be tactical in your approaches and slip by your enemies as if you were never there creeping around in the shadows is the best approach However sometimes you will be seen and have no choice but to eliminate any witnesses After doing so you should then elect to hide the bodies in the shadows as not to alert anyone of your presence Causing a panic can easily create a real mess that will sound alarms and quickly end your mission in a bad way This play with light and dark is very well executed and amplifies the immersive qualities of the game Even now years after its initial release Splinter Cell is still worth picking up and playing In fact I originally purchased Splinter Cell for the Game Cube to take advantage of the exclusive connectivity features which enable the player to use sticky cams and have a tactical map displayed on their GBA which is very neat by the way Only after playing the two following Splinter Cell games Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory on Xbox did I then decide to buy the Xbox version of the original Splinter Cell I played through all of the missions again this time including the exclusive downloadable maps from Xbox LIVE and found it to be even more enjoyable than the fist time around Splinter Cell is a truly classic and timeless game that should be in every gamer s collection 
splinter cell totally awesome my favorite game ever the sound is revolutionary the graphics are top notch it is so real you ll freak although the PS2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics so i would buy the PS2 version if I were you A must own for every gamer it will change your life 
Splinter Cell When I first played this game I was shocked Just of how good a stealth game could actually be Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies Its really fun also suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game You only use two guns during the whole game the pistol and the rifle that has attachments Good stuff All you need is that and you can take out a whole building full of enemies You have to crouch and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released I highly recommend this game Great storyline and the last level is hecka hard 
A not very well known gem Theres alot of rpg s out there that ppl stumble on or find with some research and this would be one of those By finding it I found myself to be one happy camper when I got it and got it going You can play this for a very long time or you can play this for a short amount of time but Im positive if your into dungeon crawl types you will love this one My favorite part about this particular game is not having to have a key chart sitting in front of me at all times to glance at to remind me of what key does what I hate games that have so many controls that you cant just PLAY them w o memorizing so many key strokes to even move much less play There is also active forums with lots of info for this game even though its not a well known game here in the USA All in all I recommend this highly Great graphics but you wont have to have a high end rig to run it There is already an addition to this out replay value is high on this one 
Wireless is the way to go My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection so while I wasn t thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter I have to say it was completely worth it Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360 I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn t known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together At first the 360 would access Xbox Live but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router I live in center city Philadelphia and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available The range must be good because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code I think it is a WEP number I was able to punch the router s ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home I have never had a single issue since I don t think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone s fault but my own since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others All in all I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years This adapter works great is small and disappears behind the console reduces the clutter of wires and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area It was definitely a worthy purchase 
Easy set up works pretty well two floors away Overall I am pretty happy with this unit My only complaint is it is a little underpowered as far as grabbing my router signal My laptop has 5 bars in the basement but I can typically only get two on the Xbox 360 with this adapter Because of this it does drop its signal occasional with my Linksys WRT54GS Router However it is also about 50 ft away assuming a direct line with two floors and several walls in the way Still using this unit was much better than figuring out how to hardwire my Xbox from two floors away Setup was a breeze I plugged it in it snaps nicely into the back of the 360 and plugs into the nearby USB using a short cord went to the network setting on the 360 selected the wireless slot found my network and typed in my WPA key for my router Done It took all of 5 minutes start to finish Until buying this I just dragged a 100 ethernet cable down the steps and through doorways anytime I wanted to connect to XBox Live What a pain This is not a perfect solution if you have a lot of space and stuff between your router and Xbox 360 but is fine for my needs which mostly includes downloading from XBox Marketplace and occasional online play If you are an avid XBox Live player and you setup is like mine you might want to consider a hardwire solution You may ocassionally lose your signal in the middle of a game 
Easy Setup All I had to do was plug it into the console and bring up XBox Live and it connected The only thing I did not like is that I would have preferred an Ethernet connection in lieu of the USB connection Other than that the product worked as intended 
Wireless network adapter Expensive but worth it it just works No more wires 
A little trouble to set up but overall brings a great experience I enjoy having wireless especially with broadband I have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong Set up is easy for most Although if you have a Linksys router WRT 54G ver 2 get ready for some work It took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice Since then I have not had any problems A little expensive but worth it in the long run 
Easier than many alternatives I was using a basic Linksys wireless game adapter with my 360 and it worked fine However it needed to be connected to a PC for firmware updates making it impossible for Mac users and was generally more difficult to set up than the official adapter from Microsoft I ended up getting this adapter on sale and setting it up was a snap It gets decent throughput and saves some energy over an external adapter because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on It was also nice to see that this supports WPA networks If your time is valuable to you this is probably worth the extra few dollars over similar products You just snap it on enter your network s password and you re off 
Well worth it I used a Linksys Media Center Extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater This product completley replaced the need for the Extender was extremely easy to setup WEP enabled and works flawlessly I do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a Media Center PC The music streaming is every bit as good Setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code Well done Microsoft Tom Las Vega 
X Box What s that There are two major factions when it comes to video games and if you weren t aware of their existence I ll be happy to illucidate for you Group 1 and by far the most numerous are the console gamers Group number 2 the one to which I subscribe is based on PC games I ll be the first to admit that as a PC gamer I tend to view consoles with suspicion as my experiences are that they place looks flash and hefty price tags above gameplay and plot The console audience tends to be younger than the PC group and these are the very aspects which appeal to them So it was equal parts hesitation and excitement that I felt as I put this game onto my hard drive For those not in the know once upon a time back in the early days of Microsoft s X Box there was this nifty game called Halo and my how the console gamers snapped it up I saw the commercials on TV of course and thought it looked pretty good but felt it too bad that it was an X Box title and not one available on my trusty ol PC Halo puts the player squarely in the armored shoes of Master Chief a one of a kind super marine engineered to bring the big guns on the Covenant a consortium of deranged religious aliens bent on the destruction of all of humanity No ship is allowed to go to Earth as it s location is a closely held secret which the Covenant wishes to possess at all costs But Earth is losing the war precipitating the creation of a new super soldier the Spartan II Just before the Spartan s were to be used on the Covenant s home planet the latter launches a surprise attack on the facility and destroys all but one You In a gambit to elude pursuit the last ship left the Pillar of Autumn jumps into hyperspace and ends up in orbit around a strange ringworld named Halo but are immediately attacked by their pursuers who seem to have tracked down the Autumn in no time Now complaint number one I have of this game stems from the fact that everything I just described is not taken from the game itself It comes from the game s manual A plot this interesting should at least have been included in the opening scenes C mon Microsoft you have the money pony it up to spruce up the introduction It s a good plotline so don t waste it on the manual which will only be kept in a desk drawer of some juvenile for the next 10 years and forgotten until next decade s spring cleaning Plot and first gripe now aside let s focus on the game itself I refuse to judge a game by it s age as too many do nowadays for instance I still play the original Half Life and think the plot and gameplay more than make up for the aged graphics The game looked fine on my PC and I never experienced anything close to screen lag The colors and contours of the alien world and ship hallways are nicely rendered and the sound and ambient noise are above average The music itself has nice choral sequences such as featured on the menu screen to downright cheap MIDI sounding music which felt out of sorts with the rest of the game The weapons selection is small but surprisingly good and for any given situation you ll likely have access to the weapon s needed to surmount it I particularly like the Plasma Pistol with it s supercharged shots as well as that everlasting mainstay of FPS games the shotgun The ability to drive vehicles is included in the game something that separates Halo from most other FPS s and it is a lot of fun In particular I loved driving the Scorpion tank which demolishes everything in it s path You can also fly around in an enemy Banshee light fighter which made getting past a couple of levels that much easier The game s plot flows smoothly and the voice acting is pretty good And now for the gripes Right off the bat I will say that level design has to be the single biggest detraction from this game Beautiful outdoor environments are used in this game but not nearly enough You ll spend most of it traversing hallway after hallway which connect to rooms that look identical to the one you just left Doing this 2 3 times is enough but when you spread out a level that runs outwards of up to 3 hours of the same thing it gets reaaaally stale Case in point in the chapter s in which you spend time with the Monitor traveling through the Library This section of the game was draining and seemed without end It wasn t fun just stressful The level in which the player is introduced to the Flood felt much the same although it was still a lot of fun Vehicles are fun but require the mouse to steer This obviously is a remnant of the X Box where players had to steer the Warthog with the control toggle thing but I found that mostly it had me skidding against walls and occasionally flipping The Ghost was the only vehicle I was able to use the strafe keys on to assist with steering The enemies themselves do tend to get a little stale after a while and during my first couple of hours of playing I wondered what I had gotten myself into The Grunts little pointy backed gnomish aliens spend most of their time running away and speaking an Ewok accented English It s very distracting and considering the nature of the other baddies they seemed a little out of place The lumbering Hunter who is super armored was also incredibly stupid At first I had trouble negotiating them but soon learned that by employing certain attack patterns I could easily waste one in under a minute The other aliens tend to use good combat tactics and I found dealing with them more difficult The plot itself which I classify as very good bordering on great kept me interested It ain t Half Life but it works well enough to have my curiousity piqued about Halo 2 which I might have to go ahead and buy in the near future I m sure that had Halo been released on the PC first which is what was originally intended it d have left a recognizable mark on the FPS shooter on that platform So that s that A very good game and one in which I look forward to the continuing storyline of Master Chief killer extraordinaire 
Can t touch this one but I want to What else needs to be said Even with a low end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN Perfect combination for a laptop notebook Too bad Sir William Gates won t allow a PC version of Halo 2 Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc 
Entertaining game It is a fun first person shooter game The graphics are decent and the story line s ok The game s play time is about 15 20 hours 
It Couldn t be Better For the First Game I LOVE this game The storyline is wonderful I guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs But what I LOVE is playing multiplayer And someone did bash the multiplayer but there are TONS of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates I ve had this game for years and I never get tired of playing online Actually it s kind of addicting 
Highly reccomended way to become socially reclusive Love this game Great story line Just make sure your computer can handle it 
Awsomeness Action action and satisfaction Totally awesome and entirtaining This videogame will rock your world Cool new characters and weapons tactics and awsomeness 
STAR WARS at it s best I decided to buy STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO on Xbox for my son because he won t let me play my PC version Come to find out it seems like it plays easier on Xbox This game is by far one of the best I ve ever played It s awesome I find it very exiting and actually feels like being part of a combat squad Everyone in the team knows to be pro active rather than reactive I haven t seen a game yet where the squad members react to direct or indirect fire as these Commandos do it You don t move with your team they ll do their job You can also redirect their orders and they will follow orders to the letter Being able to inject them with Bacta makes the game a whole lot better that just finding a med kit and on the other hand while you re injured being rescued by your crew definitely gives you the feeling that you are a TEAM The only regret just a small one is that the game was so short or at least it felt like it It only has three major campains and with a game that is so much fun it seemed like time flew by I can only hope that LUCASARTS decides to make a Republic Commando II maybe based on the missions of OMEGA squad here s hoping I definintely recommend this game for Squad based combat or STAR WARS fans alike you ll get a kick out of it I m definintely a fan of Delta Squad Republic Commandos 
Really fun until you beat it I m 15 and I have Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2 Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 this game and I m getting LEGO Star Wars in the mail any day now I really like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 1 but this is a game that is hard to place as to how much I like it I got this game 2 days ago after work at like 2 PM and I played it until like 1 AM and then I woke up the next day at about 9 AM and I beat it at maybe 1 PM So it took me about half a day to beat I was really mad when I beat it because I was having fun and it just suddenly ended And it was a really stupid ending too The Good You have a really good control over your squad with a variety of different orders such as telling a squad mate to set up a sniping position in one spot or telling your slicer to slice open a door for you This is good so that you dont have to do everything yourself and you dont have to rely on your squad to give you covering fire when it takes a whole minute to slice into a computer data base The weapons are pretty sweet and they are ones that you have never really seen before except for maybe thermal detonators or a wookie bowcaster If you become incapacitated you can tell your squad to come revive you or if you don t feel like fighting tell them to just maintain their current orders and revive you after the fighting is done The way to heal yourself is a bacta station which I think is better than running over a health container The AI is good so your squad actually knows how to fight The Bad The game is a lot shorter than I expected with only about 3 different planets ships There are only about 5 different enemies Battle droids Super Battle droids Trandoshans Geonosians and Magna Guards The enemies all act the same in every battle Super Battle droids are really annoying in a fight because they are really tough to beat if you just have a blaster rife unless you re a noob and play it on easy Telling your squad to do things gets repetative after a while The ending sucks Once you beat it you can only play the game over on a harder setting which is not really that fun or play with your friends on multiplayers which isn t fun either So you just put it back on the shelf for a while until you re bored and feel like playing it again So all in all this is a really fun game until you beat it So I suggest that you pace yourself 
Almost just like Halo This game is pretty cool u are in a 4 man squad made up of you the Leader Orange Scorch the demoshing guy yellow Fixer the guy who hacks into stuff green and Sev the sniper red I in this game it basicly is the battle of geonsis and wht happens from there to eposode 3 And amazingly it is almost just like halo Ad in some parts has more blood to it like when you stab a alien with your knife the blood shoots on your visor yes this game has more than robots anyhow this game is becoming out dated so by it here you ll love it 
the first game i ever beat this game is very good it jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don 
Great with a few flaws I throughly enjoyed this game The voice acting may not be the greatest but I think the gameplay is really well done and the atmospheres are fantastic The controls take some getting used too and are not for everyone They are a problem and could have been better to control surprisenly I can do it very well The major problem I have is that as the game progresses it gives you less times to save so you have to go through almost an entire level though short and complete it WITHOUT saving once That is so stupid because if you die at the end you have to do the entire level over again that is the dumbest thing ever in a video game I just feel it s unfair for the game makers to make a fairly difficult level then make you do it over and over if you slip and die toward the end Stupid stupid stupid The levels can be a bit difficult if you re not one to be quick on the trigger And as much I gripe on the camera angles they re useful in stopping Max at the end a hall swing the camera around and see if an enemy is around the corner waiting on the steps right inside the next room etc It gives you a heads up and makes it easier to stay alive However I still really liked it I didn t enjoy MP2 as much but MP3 which should end the series I think should re SHOULD be much better I m looking forward to it 
Max Payne Prepared to be Enthralled and Annoyed From the commercials Max Payne was a third person shooter with a twist the twist being able to kill mobsters junkies and mercenaries in slow motion Truly one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you Aside from the slow mo Max Payne is essentially a third person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti hero Max Payne The story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game The jist of it is Max s wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he s on the hunt for revenge The plot widens thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game One can never tell who truly is on Max s side until the moment the credits roll at the end The bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion bullet time Gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision That brings about the issue with controls One of the cons of the game are the controls Many times have I fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making Max move just so to the right The heavy load times can also add to the agony especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way The game is definitely run on a sliding scale The chapters start out a cake walk and progress to a veritable teeth grinder At one point I was so fed up and enraged by the game that I had to go outside and take a walk If however you can take the time out to relax focus and be patient you should have little problem with the game As for guns there are lots of them And more ammo than you can handle Oftentimes you ll find a gun you really like and stick with it in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies That being said guns don t hold as much ammo as one would want especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds Max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself proof that he s not a guy to be messed with I personally was very much hooked on it The cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner soliloquies lifted from a Dashiell Hammett novel However simply put one will either love or detest this game I was reeled in by it but am very glad I ve beaten and seen the end of it However if you just cannot get enough Max Payne there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third even harder setting unlocked after those The game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging I wouldn t recommend picking this game up unless you re ready for oftentimes graphic violence innuendo and potty mouthery I also wouldn t recommend picking up this game if you re not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration It is however conquerable and you ll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges 
Great Game This is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game You get over 20 different vehicles and guns The TV like gameplay makes for a good story line There s hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first PS2 games Gran Theft Auto 50 Driv3r 30 Starsky and Hutch priceless 
Great cooperative game experience I haven t tried it with the light gun yet but even with 2 dual shocks this is a unique and accessible 2 player co op game one drives one shoots with decent replay value I don t think the difficulty can be increased but it s fun to go back and beat your old scores and play with the unlocked cars i suppose it could be finished in a rental but personally I find it s nice to own some simple co op games like this that you can pop in and play right away if a friend shows up esp if that friend is not a hardcore gamer as a 1 Player game it starts to feel like GTA lite after awhile although for kids this one is better because it lacks the mature content 
an excellent game with some ending problems what i mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it i can t even imagine a 5 star game i ve come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars anyway ahem this is about gun a very nice game i looked forward to a lot i played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it the positives graphics this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism and detail gun s detail was not like i dont know half life 2 or something i didn t repeatedly go wow unbelievable todays technology but i really enjoyed them they were pretty to look at they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing bright colorful open western vistas instead of dark gloomy tense industrial claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like i don t know 95 of all shooters it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such i appreciated that quite a bit difficulty well i can t remember if this game had difficulty levels but i like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice i do not like dying even if i can reload right away and i am not too great at these games well so up until the last part of the game more about that later i had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged the poker was too easy though and i could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through i thoroughly completed everything else characters voice acting pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting i don t want any spoilers here so i ll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline but i still liked them and they looked pretty good to me gameplay it was quite fun and varied it had some of the best bullet time ever called quickdraw or something i loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that i was beating 11 people in a gunfight the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express i liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do length i may be an exception but the vast majority of games go too long for me the feel of them and the things i do in them become redundant and i don t finish so i like that gun seemed manageable for the most part i was pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried like the way you can get every upgrade possible the negative story it should have gone a bit lighter i mean it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated they just have too much on their plate vis a vis gameplay and choice the cutscenes and acting were nice and it started solidly but storywise it progressively deteriorated or i guess was completely unable to fufill its set up it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but well more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me remember how i hate that but it was irritatingly stupid and senseless to the reality of the game conclusion wow only one big negative but the huge long ending boss battle really bugged me really good game though oh and by the way i have a pretty midlevel computer and fading fast and didn t have any real technical problems maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns but mostly it was smooth that s just you know for what that s worth anyway if some of what i am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out 
Great product Great deal The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account even if you do have the headset The card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game limited time offer easily helps to make your money back Even if they didn t include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate In fact it s almost like you re getting a headset for free So like I said if you need live buy Also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at Best Buy I checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit 
A game I trully did not want to stop playing This game remains one of my favorite games of all time I m an old school game I ve played computer games since I had an atari st with cartridge I played the other GTA games I liked them very much they are all addictive This one this one is trully the jewel in the crown There are many things I could say but I just don t want to repeat the same waffle It s a great game the characters are all superb voiced by great actors Ray Liotta is just on fire as Tommy Vercetti I m still suprised they got all of this talent there seems to be no stone un turned even Blondie get s a minor part This is many thumbs way up Indeed it s notorious it s not for minors though no doubt there are more minors played this than adults A lot of it s subject matter are just for kicks just teh kind of amusement we seek because it s the kind of thing we would never normally do in our wildest dreams The other part inmo is jsut sheer style I can t recommend this title enough The only possible downside to it and this is just being picky is the loading times between various parts of the city This was eliminated in San Andreas but this one is the one I run this town ME Tommy Vercetti 
Another Kid s Review I am a kid I will NOT reveal my age but I have been playing GTA for a few years It has entertained me so much I just got the PS2 version and I am ordering the PC version Here is my rating in detail 1 Horrible 2 Bad 3 So So 4 Good 5 Impressive Gameplay 4 I m sorry I can t say that GTA Vice City has no glitches because it does have many glitches Other than that the gameplay is perfect Kept me busy for hours Audio 5 HOLY The sound in GTA Vice City is so cool the 80 s radio the realistic firearm sounds the car s engine the pitterpatter of your shoes wow That s all I can say Graphics 3 GTA has never I repeat NEVER took full advantage of graphics They have always been low quality for their time but good enough so that it s playable It s pretty modern Missions 5 The missions go in deep and affect the storyline in ways you can t imagine One even involves going around in an ice cream truck and selling ice cream with drugs in it It s vulgar but fun Overall 4 1 out of a possible 5 A highly ranked game in my book I hope you enjoy it too 
You ll love this game more than your own children Man I am sick of people mentioning the violence and cursing and sex that s in this game DUH This is as redundant as saying the sun is bright and hot I don t even see what the big deal is The gore in it isn t exactly realistic the blood splattering and gushing isn t that great looking and I ve seen much more disturbing games The violence is almost like cartoon violence in some ways It isn t really that big a deal There is some very moderate cursing and there s some sex Yes you can pick up hookers No you don t see any action Yes there s a strip club and sluttily dressed women but these aren t exactly real looking people Just lighten up If you don t want your 8 year old exposed to it then don t buy it for him but I better not see your hipocritical a buying him an R or even PG 13 movie This really is no different than watching some PG 13 movies and any R movie In fact they may be worse I think you should relax if the kid is 12 and that s being generous Now enough with that bulls t On to the game It s great What else do you expect You could play this game for hours and never get bored You can do whatever you want steal a car speed around town run over people do drive bys rob a store kill a person for no reason with a variety of weapons see how long you can evade the law do a mission do a sub mission such as the paramedic pick up a hooker and get some health etc etc etc There s plenty of side missions to do and those are what ll take up the most time not any of the storyline or asset missions The hardest ones are the paramedic vigilante firefighter Brown Thunder and Pizza Boy missions as far as I am concerned because there you have a time limit and if you re vehicle blows up you re f ked and have to start all over again You ll take a long time getting all the Hidden Packages Rampages and all that stuff but that s not so hard because it s not something that s really hard Just tedious There s also some race missions that are tough but they can be done with some persistence The controls are great The driving s excellent and so is the on foot ones The auto aim works easily enough though you sometimes target the ones you don t want to but you can get around this without too much difficulty The boats are harder to control though and the helicopters can be tricky But the boats are the worst since they have a habit of over accelerating and over steering But the controls in general are good enough so that you can pretty quickly get used to them and before you know it you ll be cruising around town like a pro The graphics are quite nice The cars are very realistic looking In fact after playing this if you go outside and look at real cars they ll remind you of the ones in the game You ll even feel like driving them like you did in the game But obviously you won t because you re not as stupid and f ked up like that guy who killed those cops and then like a p sy blamed the game for making him do it Don t listen to those a holes It s all a bunch of crap The only complaints I have would be on the people They could look better and the blood could be a little better too especially when it gushes from someone you shoot I would like to see more blood too The camera angles are the main flaw of the game Sometimes you ll want it to point in a different direction so you can see what you re shooting at Another problem is when you re in the helicopter That can get screwed up with you turn around and the angle has to catch up with you On foot if you re not auto targeting you you have a button to adjust the camera angle to where you re facing but when you re in the vehicles not so The only time this really is a problem though is in the chopper The sound is excellent Even the sounds themselves are nice You have great voice acting by some well knowns and even nonwell knowns but it s all fantastic The dialogue is fantastic too You ll hear people on the street talking amongst themselves and they ll do stuff such as tell you to move sometimes not so nicely when you park a car in the middle of the flow of traffic They ll scream and plead for their lives or even taunt you when you point a gun at them or attack them Your character will even say things to people like when he steals their car or kills them such as My need is greater than yours or It s only money It s great The humor value on this game is top notch and that has a lot to do with the sounds I mentioned above as well as how fun it is to kill people for whatever reason if there s a reason but also with the RADIO I can t believe more people aren t commenting on this This is one of the highpoints in this game just like on GTA3 only this time they don t make up all their own songs which is bad or good depending on how you look at it I love cruising around town listening to KChat VRock or VCPR that latter of which is the funniest of all I usually listen to these because they are the funniest talk radio is obviously funnier than music stations even though there is talk from the DJ s and call in listeners and the commercials and because I like rock music and they play actually good bands like Iron Maiden and Anthrax They do make up some of their own music I know they make up an in game band which you actually can do missions with called Love Fist a group of drunken Scotts But the radio is hilarious not just the talk radio but the commercials especially as well Knife After Dark Rated R for Retarded The game has some flaws but overall it s d m near perfect The makers of the game basically took all they did in GTA3 and added to it but failed to really fix these few flawss I mentioned But they re nothing in comparison to the overall fun this game provides There is at least over 100 hours even if you re familiar with the over all gameplay from GTA3 if you try to do 100 or at least something close to that I have no idea how I m gonna complete all those submissions Look this is one of the easiest decisions you ll ever make in your life Just buy the d m game And if that s not enough to convince you as one of the radio characters in the game Jeremy Robar says Just listen to these endorsements And remember these people volunteered They aren t being paid much 
We re taking over this town After playing Grand Theft Auto III I thought there was no way Rockstar could top themselves In fact when the advance word for this game got out I actually thought this was nothing more than an ADD ON for GTA3 Stupid thought I know on the whole GTA VC is bigger badder and more audacious than GTA3 ever was So here s the story In 1986 Tommy Vercetti a hitter for the Forelli crime family in Liberty City is finally released from prison Sonny Forelli his boss immediately sends him down to Vice City to close a major drug deal being handled by Ken Rosenberg a shyster lawyer and the Forellis contact No sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up kill everyone but Tommy and Ken and take both the drugs and the cash Now Tommy has to recover the money for Sonny but before long he decides to make a name for himself in this town The setting is pure 80s excess through and through If you take the bottomless amoral corruption of Scarface the day glo polyester fashion of Miami Vice and the innate cheesy greed of Ronald Reagan s 1980s American culture you ll have Vice City You ll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens the local architecture and the cars tooling around on the road You ll even hear it in the radio stations which boast an array of heavy metal dance Latino and bubblegum pop music the like of which you haven t even thought of since the 80s I swear try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories don t come flooding back The voice acting is as usual superb Ray Liotta did an outstanding job bringing Tommy Vercetti to life and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character And there are others as well Burt Reynolds Dennis Hopper Gary Busey Lee Majors Fairuza Balk and Robert Davi all turn in great performances But Philip Michael Thomas who played Don Johnson s partner Tubbs on Miami Vice gets special mention in more ways than one his character Lance Vance is the one to keep an eye on While the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself it s the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out it also adds length to the game and really makes you feel like you re establishing a criminal empire They re called asset properties At a certain point in the game you have the option of buying certain businesses Once you buy one of these asset properties and you complete its mission strand that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up Some of them are perfectly legitimate such as the taxi company or the nightclub Others are a little sketchy like the boatyard or the strip club but others are absolutely illegal like the protection rackets the ice cream company or the car showroom They add a great amount of depth and they let you establish contacts across town Needless to say once Sonny Forelli comes to town to check up on you make no mistake he s now in YOUR town So if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner Tony Montana book a trip to Vice City Like San Andreas it s a great place to visit and unwind and also like San Andreas you ll be glad YOU don t live there 
Important for Nintendo fans With the Wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one Some preordered it while some others including me are camping out for it But some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction Sure sideways Wii controllers are S NES controllers but what of gamecubes I am happy to say that I have gotten a chance to play around with the Wii before anyone else And yes the wavebird Receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the Wii It looks pefectly at home there Rejoice gamers Pick up your wavebirds and play on 
Awesome the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is Super Smash Bros Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle 
I felt like I was 11 years old again playing this game I bought a nintendo ds so I can play super mario brothers for ever like I was when I was a kid Its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger My 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and I had to buy him a DS along with mario so he could play it after I left to go back home 
Mario in his best I have always loved Mario and when I purchased my new Nintendo DS Lite I bought this with it This game is absolutely amazingly fun The graphics sound and the game itself are incredible This game is good for any adult or child Although for a younger child it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating With this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again and possibly again after that But every time you try again you understand something new about the level and it really is fun There also are the features of becoming Mega Mario and Mini Mario which mixes things up every once and a while This game is wonderful definitely a great buy 
New Super Mario Bros I bought the game for my daughter but I play it more than she does This game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love Super Mario Bros 
Good When Playing I loved the game and the side scrolling was a nostalgic step back in time for me The game play was difficult at times Honestly I beat the a game in less than 2 weeks with a grad student schedule and immunology test in the middle Finishing everything completely all levels and all star coins was a challenge in and of itself But it reminded me of the GTA series because after you beat the game there is really nothing to do anymore in the mushroom kingdom The minigames are amazing time wasters I find myself playing them when waiting 5 minutes for other people etc I have had limited experience with the multiplayer but it was VERY fun of you have a friend with a DS Best feeling seeing the 3 stars next to my saved game and getting to level 176 of the where s waldo minigame 
Definitely New Not So Interactive which is ok I think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky Sort of like Mario 64 DS And like Mario Kart you have the 2nd screen as your map But you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want That s really the jist of this game when it comes to NEW features Someone wrote loosely based off the old 2D side scroller Marios but actually this is very much based off them entirely The only difference is that the environments and characters are in full 3D yet still side scrolling view Which is a nice touch watching the 3D models move around like that Other then that it s a nice update to the old classics Especially big Mario which you never do get much to play with thanks to the use of a giant mushroom And vice versa a mini mushroom that causes Mario to shrink and the only way to access the other levels by defeating the enemy bosses as Mini Mario There s also a new shell costume of which Mario dons but can quickly get out of control if you run to fast and he spins all over All in all it s a very fun game entertaining but not very hard which is good for the young folks but those reminiscent of the old days know how hard it was to beat a Mario game back then and this was surprisingly easy Luckily the game is packed with mulitplayer features and mini games to add to the value and they do Not all are entirely fun but the majority do make use of the touchpad and make up for not using it much throughout the game Playing 2 player will always be fun of course unfortunately it s not WIFI so you have to be within range of someone else with the game 
GTA3 RULES GTA III rules but its not the greatest game ever thats why it gets overall of 4 but it still is awesome but GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY RULES EVEN HARDER Xbox version is best 
The Curse of 3D Castlevania games Castlevania Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die hard Castlevania fan might not much get into Lament of Innocence wasn t a terrible game but it wasn t great And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth it has problems Sometimes scary problems Like Lament of Innocence it had so much potential to be good this title more so But it doesn t deliver and that s a sad revelation to admit to especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash Dawn of Sorrow Ever since the 1997 all time best Symphony of the Night so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception He looks a little like Alucard But we re not here to discuss that Hector is a Devil Forgemaster one who has given up his powers Dracula is dead but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia Hector however isn t concerned about what kind of shape the world is in He s more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac who has killed his beloved If you couldn t guess it s time for revenge And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome And by doing so Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot The story actually unfolds with excellent voice acting but there isn t much story Since Symphony of the Night we ve been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania This is marvelous and once again makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania You explore a large castle riddled with goodies This includes weapons subweapons armor and much more Playing the game can be quite fun Most of the game as you might have guessed is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters That isn t as boring as you might think You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies but each one must be finished with the B button You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos This makes the camera go crazy though but this is forgiveable Battling without locking on is actually much better and it isn t too hard to do without Although if you want to steal from your enemies you ll have to lcok on to em Speaking of stealing it s nice that you can actually do that Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage Again you must be locked on for it to happen Likewise unlike Lament of Innocence they actually use the level up system In other words there s actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time You also have little helper monsters You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror but the better comparison would be Pokemon They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies just as you do It s nice not to have to go at it alone but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone Each enemy also drops evolution crystals Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve You won t grow to like them though That s the sad part and they don t really enhance the gameplay The monsters have special abilities though Golem like creatures can open heavy doors imps let you bury underground But you can t help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters Also no evolution crystal is the same You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve One of the nice things about being a devil forger you can make your own weapons And Hector can do it at any time he wants That s right no running back to some stupid shop to do it Monsters often drop raw materials and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger You can do this simply by opening the menu I don t know about you but that s pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that The weapons have their own little downside however With the exception of the sword none of them are highly helpful in combat You start the game off with a short sword and you ll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use Other weapons just aren t fast enough and enemies aren t weak to a certain weapon type This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points Unless you re a person who likes to use cool looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons you won t have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system except to power up your sword Thus experimenting with weapons garners no fun It is pretty cool I must say to be venturing somewhere that isn t Dracula s castle Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia Meaning you ll trek through swamps mountains valleys and a lot more So if you re tired of Dracula s castle this is quite a change The problem with this world is that you don t see enough of it There s not enough detail to it You have to follow a beaten path so it isn t really that different than Dracula s castle in Lament of Innocence so you can t go off and just explore the places you re at The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from the lack of detailed enviroments You ll no doubt run down the same path hall corridor several times over If it weren t for the map you d find yourself lost thinking you must be in one of those looping ares or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle The monsters are also not so great What I love about the 2D Castlevania games especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow is how much variety is thrown into the monsters The attacks they use on you Even if they re the same looking monster they throw in some new attack that you don t expect Curse of Darkness like Lament of Innocence has no variety You ll run into the same batch of monsters constantly and they ll never do something new Later in the game you ll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new Likewise all the monsters you ll ever see are encountered pretty early on The moment you run into an Axe Armor you ve run into em all They ll never change I sound like I m being picky about the enemies thing but I m not It takes away from the challenge of the game The fact that reincarnates don t do anything new makes it more true And that s not the worst part the game overall just isn t a challenge The bosses can be at times but if you ve been playing 3D action games I think you ll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy Later on however they get start to get hard and that s when battling them actually becomes fun Again though if you re an action adventure pro you ll probably beat most of them on your first try I wish I could say the graphics are great Hey Hector looks great in combat But the enviroments don t have enough detail Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we ve been seeing for a long time now Where s the detail You know like maybe the leaves on a tree moving We re at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment instead of it seeming like we re running through a still life painting Visually it doesn t look half bad It s just that there could be so much more The bosses look cool and the framerate doesn t slow down at all but there isn t enough variety or detail However I must say this the music sounds AWESEOME As usual the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming Is it better than Symphony of the Night No it s not It isn t better than Lament of Innocence either which also had steller music but it is still among the best you ll ever hear in a video game Likewise the voice acting is actually really really GOOD I just wish I could ve heard more of it Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game But there are a lot of things that keep it down It s a fairly fun game to play but it lacks innovation You won t be able to separate it from the other action adventure 3D games It s got nothing that makes it stick out If you MUST have this game however I d say wait for a price drop If you re really looking for a good Castlevania game I d suggest getting a hold of Dawn of Sorrow It s a much better game The Good +Great Music Some of the best in gaming +Good weapon system +It s pretty fun to play +You can steal from enemies +Great Voice acting The Bad Little innovation Lack of cutscenes to advance the story Too much of the game gets recycled too fast Too easy The game doesn t look bad but there s little imagination in the environments Not a whole lot of different enemies It s too easy Boring level designs not enough of them You just can t help that the game has almost no innovation It s no different than your average action adventure 3D game Get Dawn of Sorrow or one of the other 2D versions of the game They seem to fare so much better than this one does Even the die hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland 
LOVED IT Saw the movie HAD to get the game I also have Project Zoo that was good too Overall not bad but then again we love Wallace Gromit Loved the fact a friend could join in at any time to help but you have to stay close though We found the camera engine was a tad of a pain like with two players the camera might get stuck in a wall blocking your view tunnels could be a problem but a quick fix we did was one player would exit play for a moment that would reset the camera then the other could rejoin It was a challenge to beat the game at 100 but my sister and I did just that Got a brain wedgie finding all the rabbits but loved it just the same Loved being free to roam about and explore try reading the little signs scattered about on walls They are cool Will play it again Addictive game fun to boot That from a thirty something yes I still play video games Some say all the weird ones Thank you Nick Park for allowing the games And making the movie 
Good Story Fun Game but Buggy I enjoyed playing this game when it would let me the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous crashes left and right It was a good story though I suppose I could give you a few tips To stop the Dantooine framerate from dropping go to the folder where your game files are ex c program files lucasarts swkotor2 and open the swkotor2 ini file on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it and under the Graphics Options heading insert a line and type Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 That should get rid of any bad framerate drops on Dantooine and at least make it playable Also I had a glitch near the end of the game where I went back to Dantooine but when I tried to get off my ship the planet wouldn t load I tried restarting and all that jazz nothing worked finnaly I found online a cheatcode to warp straight to Dantooine so to use it open the swkotor2 ini file as I said above and under the Game Options header insert a line and type EnableCheats=1 Then Start StarWars KOTOR2 and load your game and press this button the one with the sign right above it just above the tab key Then type warp 605dan Then Press Enter Don t worry about the fact you can t see your typing the cheat console is invisible And Tada Your on Dantooine and Can finish your game The only other advice I have for you is Save Often and Don t OverWrite Your Saved Games I found that saving your games as 1 2 3 4 etc to be a quick way to do this May the Force be with You 
A decent game Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG s It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent 
This is her son IF YOU EVER PLAYED ANY KOTOR GAME U KNOW THAT ITS THE KING OF RPGs AND I KNOW THAT U ALL WANT THE 3RD GAME TO COME OUT TO BUT IT ISENT THE GAME GOT CANCELLED AND A BUNCH OF GUYS ONLINE ARE TRYIN TO RESURECT THE KOTOR SERIES BY MAKING THIS PETITION WE DONT HAVE NO WHERE NERE AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD ROUND 3600 SO HELP US OUT AND GO TO petition online AND HELP US RESURECT THIS GREAT SERIES 
Deserves to be the best Xbox game of the year If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360 buy this game first as your last Xbox game you won t be disappointed This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console Although it has great graphics the physics are the real selling point You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun Zero Point Energy Manipulator Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should especially when you shoot them with the shotgun The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around The only drawback is choppy framerates at times Highly recommended 
Very Good Game But The Xbox Lets It Down I just finished HL2 on the Xbox and thought some of my observations might be helpful to other prospective buyers My review is primarily concerned with my struggle between getting HL2 for PC or Xbox I bought HL HL Opposing Force and HL Blue Shift for the PC when they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them Due to the HL2 Xbox price and the horror stories I d read about having to be online to use the PC version of HL2 I decided to go for the Xbox version Did I make the right choice HL2 is a very good game and at 20 for the Xbox version represents excellent value for money Great graphics great sound and engaging game play However I think HL1 on the PC is a better game than HL2 on Xbox Why First the original HL was much more open ended and there was often more than one way to do something or get somewhere With HL2 I found there was only one way Second the controls for HL1 were better and configurable With HL2 on Xbox I found some controls to be really awkward and difficult to use For example there s an air boat to drive and the direction and throttle are on the same thumb stick I assume throttle and direction are separate keys on the PC version Third when there s a lot going on for example several Combine soldiers firing at you explosions and a fair bit of scenery to display the Xbox slowed down to almost a halt It just couldn t cope with that amount of processing I never had that problem with HL1 on the PC and assume a suitably equipped PC could cope with HL2 just as well Lastly as others have mentioned you didn t have to go very far in HL2 before you saw a loading screen The frequency at which you saw this did become distracting and annoying after a while One plus for HL2 is there s no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there was in HL1 Remember all that hopping from floating platform to floating platform and plants that light up when you went near them All that nonsense has gone away which was a relief On reflection most of my gripes about HL2 have more to do with the Xbox version rather than the game itself If I had to choose again I d buy HL2 on the PC and will certainly get any HL2 spin off games for the PC if they are to appear like they did for HL1 If not I ll wait for HL3 which the ending of HL2 leaves open 
WTF STOP LOADING Half Life 2 for pc put on the x box sounds like it should work The core gameplay is still the same and is good fun once you get a few hours into it The graphics are decent but won t blow you away like the pc versian So what s the problem it s Half life 2 on the x box just a little watered down Well there is one single problem that really irritates me to the point i would give it three stars L O A D I N G This game loads more than you actually play it It simply ruins the action Your in the middle of a tense adrenaline pumped chase and your really into it when it all suddenly stops and the game loads The loading times last between seven to thirty seconds and it really just makes you want to swear at the t v screen Half life 2 for x box isn t bad game but it is completley inferior to the p c problem which had loading problems as well It s possibly worth a rental if can sit through all the constant loading but beyond the loading issue it s worth a playthrough There is no multiplayer and the single player is all your getting so don t buy 
I was not disappointed As always the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint Personally I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going and to tour the rest of the town I must admit I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn t have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose but hey it s nice to see they have a penchant for detail After all what town doesn t have a Courthouse heh Indeed this game could have been designed to be twice as enduring and there were several ways this could have been accomplished but to be honest enduring does not equate with endearing Every ND game has satisfied me on many levels even if a few levels were left wanting I also enjoyed going back in time to 1930 albeit there were a few inconsistencies regarding what took place when i e the turntable revolving the wrong way et al however a good detective will notice these faux pas Like I say there s rarely any disappointment when it comes to the Nancy Drew games One can only hope they continue to create these games indefintely My only gripe is that they come out with only two games a year My wish would be for four or five 
D D fan I love playing this game The Icewind Dale II is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great 
IWD1 does in fact run in XP I m playing a game of it now The reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because I am currently running a game of IWD1 with Windows XP as I make this post 
Icewind Dale RPG This game is great for those that enjoy role playing games There is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story It was a lot of fu 
If You Like the Show You ll LOVE the Game Ignore anyone who talks about this game s shortcomings It s a fun game addictive game Period Although one reviewer suggests that some of the levels are too easy I say that this only goes to keep the game and the plot moving In fact let s face it when you break the tasks down events in a typical episode of 24 aren t that complex You run you hide you shoot things You drive fast and chase people But you do it all looking sounding and panting yes the video Jack Bauer even breathes like him almost as if you were in the show The KISS adage is fabulously apt Keeping it simple is how the game makers have kept it fun Related to this is the comment about trying to make the actual game play last 24 hours Firstly the show itself is a little loosy goosey about real hour what with commercial breaks and its creative liberties Secondly each hour is broken up into smaller missions and learning what it takes to do well in each section can take little time Thirdly those that choose to complete their missions with finesse and higher scores will find that they re not only coming closer the hour they re also having more fun because they re acting more like the characters in the show After all I suppose that someone who wants to complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone and instead just run past the enemies Or better yet if that reviewer really wants to take the 24 hour thing seriously I m surprised that he isn t complaining about being able to save progress to a memory card He really ought to be asking for a game that s played straight out for an entire 24 hours no saving get it right the first time just like on the show 
Yet Another Day in the Life of Jack Bauer Like 90 of the people who played this game my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24 The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show it should not have been too hard to please me with this game And in that respect the game fulfilled but did not exceed my expectations While I enjoyed watching this extra day the gameplay left a lot to be desired There was quite a bit of variety which was nice and you get to play as almost every character from the show There were so many different types of missions that the standard get from point A to point B while shooting people missions only made up about 60 of the game The rest of the game involved driving computer hacking interrogating sniping and such This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked since the controls were incredibly sloppy Interrogation was kind of fun the first time but it didn t need to be done several times There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again so that they weren t much fun by the end of the game As for the rest of the game I d describe it as mediocre There wasn t anything spectacular about the gameplay there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter In addition there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult in my opinion In one such mission you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working It wouldn t be nearly so annoying if it weren t for the fact that there doesn t seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly they never hit a single enemy so you have to take everyone out yourself In all the game is worth playing through for the story if you re a fan of the show Otherwise you could find much better action games out there 
NBA Live 2006 vs NBA 2K6 So you re looking for an NBA game but don t know which one to get I shall sort through the good and bad offered in both NBA Live 2006 and NBA 2K6 Between the two I have played Live 06 and 2K6 I can honestly say NBA 2K6 was a better buy for me At 20 I ve had countless hours of some of the most joyous moments and some of the most frustrating However NBA 2K6 is more of an all around basketball game If you re good at offense and poor on defense chances are good that you won t win as many games as you might think But if you re only good at defense and horrible at offense you won t win much then either You basically have to play an even game altogether this is based on All Star level For fans of offensive minded games look no further than NBA Live 2006 The basic controls are straight forward and easy to get a hang of so there won t be any real problems for newcomers to the series such as myself The best aspect featured in Live 06 is undoubtedly the Freestyle Superstars My favorite team is the 76ers and to see Allen Iverson pulling off the moves he does in real life on a game is nothing short of a rush Another highlight is that when you re left wide open for a shot chances are extremely good that you ll drain it Whereas on 2K6 you still basically had to have a perfect release As for the overall look of each game I d say that NBA 2K6 steals that as well When you re looking at Allen Iverson or any other player for that matter there s no question who you re looking at He s got his tattoos his cornrows mustache everything NBA Live 2006 on the other hand almost tends to look childish at times Don t get me wrong the graphics and dunks are awesome to look at but as you re dribbling upcourt I can t help but think the player s arms are too long Of course that could just be me 2K6 also seems to have more realistic courts I could do without the shots of the fans though NBA 2K6 pros Fantastic gameplay The more you play the more you learn making it a game you can invest time in The graphics are great When you turn up the difficulty it ACTUALLY GETS HARDER NBA 2K6 cons Offseason on Legacy mode is kind of lame Too frustrating at times When the other team is on a run it s nearly impossible to hit anything other than a lay up Loading time is almost ridiculous NBA Live 2006 pros Easy for anyone to pick up and play Freestyle Superstars Commentary is a lot better than 2K6 Dunks are fairly easy to execute and make for some excellent highlights NBA Live 2006 cons Camera angle is horrible Far too offensive minded Almost too easy at times Fouls are called too liberally on you So there you have it a fairly unbiased view on each game If Live 06 were to drop down to 20 I d highly recommend it because in reality it really is fun to play But at 30 I m not sure if it s worth every penny Plus 2K6 has a great street ball mode in addition to the legacy mode so did Live 06 ever really have a chance 
A benchmark in the Star Wars line of games You know what I absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard I beat it on normal in one week And this was when it first came out when I was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen But anyway this game was so fun I got it the week it came out and that Christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it I have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old 
3 years later and three years later I buy the game Wow Awesome I can t believe it runs so well after the three years of its release Everything looks and feels great on my XP This is one of the only games I have purchased and and not had to return due to the CD being messed up or some corrupted file So I m happy I thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on Yep this is a game I would suggest to any gamer 
Saves you 50 The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is very easy to set up and use All you have to do is plug the little receiver into one of the controller ports put in a DVD and enjoy The buttons on the remote are responsive and easy to get used to However the Xbox DVD system is very simple It doesn t have any eject buttons something mentioned many times by other reviewers and not as many options as more expensive stand alone DVD players You have to keep in mind that it was made for people who already have an Xbox and don t want to shell out an extra 50 for a DVD player that has a lot of special features when all they want is to be able to watch a movie The DVD itself runs exactly as it would on a good stand alone DVD player It s sort of like one of those little 100 digital cameras There isn t anything really special about them They just take good pictures that you can put on your computer 
Clarification on Xbox Dvd Kit Purchase the xbox console and dvd movie playback kit that matches the region in which you are located After you buy the dvd kit and put the dvd infrared sensor into your xbox the dvd kit permanently codes your xbox based on the region that your kit is from the region code of the dvd kit is only written on the outside packaging of the kit From that point forward you can only play dvd s from the region that the xbox dvd kit is from and ofcourse dvd s carrying the label all regions You cannot play dvd s from another region even if you later on try using a dvd kit from that other region on your xbox For instance if you are in the US and have a region 1 dvd kit and you import a dvd from abroad say having region code 3 it will not play on your xbox console But here s how you can change the dvd region on your xbox to play it 1 Send your xbox console for a repair to have it re adjusted to play dvd s from the desired region You will have to pay for a repair here even if your xbox is still in warranty period 2 Next buy a dvd kit sold for the desired region to use after your xbox console is repaired From here on in you can only play dvd s from this region and ofcourse dvd s carrying the label all regions It is is a permanent change Thus your xbox console acts like a region specific dvd player rather than a region free dvd player But all said i have no problems with the dvd kit I have a sony dvd player but i find the picture clarity better on xbox all the above info was procured from xbox customer care department To this end i hold that it is correct 
An excellent Star Wars game Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series INTRODUCTION I ve pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars and as you may have guessed I m a fan of many of the games based on the series Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss when one succeeds it usually succeeds beautifully One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces released for the Playstation One and the PC Although the game itself was horrendous with a terribly choppy framerate and very poor level design it was something the world had never seen before a Star Wars first person shooter The sequel Jedi Knight cleaned up a lot of the problems and added in some new innovations And now the third game in the series Jedi Outcast has arrived Like previous games in this sub series it has gotten a multi console release Read on to see how it fares OVERVIEW Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first person shooter The game has a one player quest as well as several different multiplayer modes REVIEW To put it simply this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been While not perfect this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn the agent from the other Dark Forces titles The second Death Star has been destroyed but many Imperial forces still fight on so it s up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them The graphics are for the most part solid I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game Nothing state of the art but they re still pretty damn good Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber The single player mode is extremely entertaining and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package And you can save whenever you want to in the single player mode But of course the game isn t perfect Like earlier Dark Forces games the level design just is not that good Too many areas look alike and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into Likewise in many cases your objectives are unclear and some of the puzzles are a pain I don t know about you but I buy first person shooters to shoot people not solve puzzles Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design it took me over an hour just to beat the first level Another huge problem is availability Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game This is a huge problem since the game s limited control selections will often clash with what you re used to for this sort of game This game wasn t released on the consoles in very high quanitites so you re likely gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy and in my mind it s NOT worth that price Sad but true I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans just be warned that it s not perfect and it s hard to get a copy EDITION NOTES This is a good game but for some strange reason it just wasn t available on the consoles for very long Because of this even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game Still you should hunt it down if you re into this sort of thing OVERALL Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub series thusfar Where the game succeeds it succeeds beautifully I am impressed with the game it s just a shame the consular version was not made readily available to all would be players I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan 
It was green now blue This game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time s but when you get all your force power s it is SO F ING FUN you can cut everybody s arm s off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool 
The Ultimate Star Wars Game Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base with no force powers But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game With amazing graphics and increddible duels this game is simply magnificent Plus the multiplayer is awesome especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you ll never want to trade in Plus the duels are fun to play again and again I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own any shooter fan really has to have and if you like both oooh you need it really bad 
Good graphics but the game was too simple and too short I do like Creature of Kapu Cave better than Danger by Design While I appreciate the quality of graphics sound effects and music it seems like the producers of the Nancy Drew games have changed hands in recent years We re seeing a stark difference in the newer games compared to their past games such as Shadow Ranch Danger on Deception Island Treasure in Royal Tower etc Those games are fantastic With the recent games play is not as fluid the tasks are too simple minded there s not much mystery or suspense if any and game play time is too short In Creature you can collect shells and make necklaces and you can go fishing for as long as you want to Or until you get bored with it The beach and water graphics are cool There is some humor with some the character conversations I enjoyed that You get to move between four locations that intertwine and make sense I didn t see any problem with the auto switching via cell phone calls between Nancy and the Hardy Boys That was not a problem for me I almost rated this a 3 star but gave it 4 due to the graphics characters and variety of locations Hopefully Her Interactive will hear their customers disappointments and revamp upcoming games Fans do want the Nancy Drew games to keep coming 
I like how idiots complain about this game The introduction ISN T boring it ISN T long and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix SE If you don t like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 1 then don t buy another RPG for as long as you live RPGs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different If you don t like it take it back and get a refund don t play RPG s like this if you can t stand words Go play some GTA or something oh wait theres words in that too 
The best RPG for the PSP so far Valkyrie Profile was an RPG that came out during the later days of the PSX While it never achieved massive success it went on to become an RPG classic and has garnered a very loyal following Fast forward to 2006 and we see the re release of this awesome RPG for the PSP However don t make the mistake of writing this off as a plain old port Valkyrie Profile Lenneth includes new high quality CG movies that help immerse you in the story The graphics consist of highly detailed sprites on pre rendered backgrounds when seen on the vivid PSP screen it just makes the game look downright beautiful Some of the combos are just awesome to look at The battle system is a mix of real time and turn based fighting that is surprisingly intuitive newcomers and old pro s will have no problem getting used to it At first glance it might look simple but as you progress through the game you ll find a depth to it that makes it quite fun The main story itself is very well developed even if this RPG doesn t follow the traditional linear way of telling it One of the things I enjoyed most about this game is the character episodes you see when you collect a new soul to help in the battle to save Valhalla If you enjoy RPGs or feel adventurous enough I highly recommend you buy this game It s definitely a must have PSP game 
Great remake but where s the fast forward My kingdom for a fast forward button Great remake but where s the fast forward My kingdom for a fast forward button This was a great game The cut scenes were a nice touch that helped draw in the player into the story line but would someone please give me a Fast Forward Skip button I understand that the makers of the game want you to get involved and appreciate the storyline but without a fastforward skip button this game game has a limited replay value I have already played through the game once and now that I am running through it again I am going insane The long cut scenes and the seemingly endless next clicks were fine the first time but come on For a game that has 3 different endings you would figure that the developers would give you a break OK now that I have said that lets get back to the review The character development and use of magical items while definitely not unique but they helped flesh out the fight scenes The combos and skills moves made the game interesting and kept me coming back While I would have liked to see the graphics slightly change when different equipment was used swords helms etc the combat and special moves graphics were definitely nice Should you buy Sure if you like RPG s the game is definitely a buy but be fore warned be prepared to read and read and read and click and click and click before you even get to your first fight scene and even then expect to much of the same long before you get to do things on your own 
Loved it just extremely hard at times Yeah this game is really fun just gets extremely hard at times towards the end Have a little over 10 hours into it kind of short I guess but each mission might take you a few tries to complete Plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like I did I d say it s easily one of the best games out for the DS though One that everyone should have in their DS collection 
REally exciting different This game is so creative It s really atypical and really exciting 
It is worth it for the Game Boy player alone and maybe Super Smash Bros Melee One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA GBC and GB games on an external source a television a projector a 5 universal screen etc I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that Then afterwards I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch The system itself is cube shaped hence the name GameCube Like the original Xbox it comes with four controller sockets and the controller is similar in appearance but smaller and no it is not better than the PS2 controller Like the PlayStation 2 it uses memory cards to store data Unique to the GameCube is a handle on the back of the unit making it easier to carry Furthermore it can be purchased in a variety of colors platinum black and purple Other colors can be imported though I would recommend finding a store that does paint jobs I m giving this an 8 3 10 but that s only because as a North American I can t help but feel somewhat cheated For whatever reason when it comes to video games and their machines the US dwellers are always deprived of really neat things like Panasonic Qs GameCubes with built in DVD players GameCube Game Boy player bundle deals PlayStation Xs NES Axe Colors Tri star adapters Game Boy hunters the availability of systems in multiple colors etc Interestingly enough I ve found this problem to be prevalent with mostly the Nintendo and Sony systems Whoever said life isn t fair sure wasn t joking If the Panasonic Q had ever been released in the US and if this system had at lest been available in more colors here without having to import an unnecessarily tedious complicated and excessively costly procedure by the way then this probably could have gotten something closer to the 5 star range but with all due respect one would think that Nintendo would start showing a little more consideration and respect for us Americans than that The KAB score 8 3 super 
Great game My son has had many happy hours with this game It came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy 
daughter loves it My husband just bought this for my five year old daughter preschool graduation gift She hasn t been able to leave it alone Now she s a little more advanced in the world of gaming than some her age and definitely better than me her mom so I can t recommend it for every kid but if your kid is adept at x box they should enjoy this one It doesn t hurt that she loves the movie as well 
Fun for kids and the not so hard core gamers We bought this for my 6 y o daughter to go with the X Box we bought for Christmas We have not owned a game system except for a game boy since the original Nintendo came out This game has been fun for us all We all play at the same time which makes for some family fun My daughter is able to play some alone without getting too frustrated and does well when we all play Personally I enjoy the comedic elements that have been well thought out If you are a hard core gamer you will probably get bored of it quickly It may not be as challenging as you like We have gotten over half way through without a cheat book which is amazing for most games 
kids humans i 37 played this game with my nephew 8 the other night on his birthday this is a Great game funny characters have great individual personalities traits just like ever with any cool game we started playing laughed alot lost track of time 1 hour had passed he was playing PS2 im buying it for my XBox tonight you should buy it for your system definitely worth it 
Playing this after playing Oblivion This is the second Elder Scrolls game I ve played the first being Oblivion I really enjoyed Oblivion and decided to give this one a try and I must say I ve really enjoyed it so far Still on the main quest though right now I m gonna join the Morag Tong Now first off if you re an impatient type or really easily confused then this game is not for you This game takes time and patience to really enjoy One thing I did when I first started playing I paid attention to what people said and went where I was told to go I know it s a game that really gives you freedom to do what you want but for someone just starting out on the series just follow the main quest line and make sure to pay attention to what people say and just go where you need to Then once you ve become more accustomed to how things work then I d suggest exploring some You ll often come across people on the roads with quests they ll want to give you that ll often deviate from your current objective I would actually suggest helping them out as the journal is often enough to get you back on track afterwards Just remember to stay on the roads and look at every sign you come across so you know which way to go In closing if you have patience and are willing to put some serious time into the game then I d suggest getting this It s an older game and the graphics are clearly outdated but it can be quite an enjoyable experience In fact I m liking it more than Oblivion which had my attention for a few months No telling when I ll be done with this one 
Game cube memory card This product is excellent Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time Good perfromanc 
Great GameCube memory card This is a great memory card for people with only a few GCN games but those who have a bigger collection will either need to buy two or the GCN Memory Card 1019 
it was a memory card My kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it 
A good game unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game and the story mode is a bit weak however they make up in that with the classic mode and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase i reccomend you buy this rather than THUG1 or THAW I garantee you will enjoy this game for a while 
ILLEST TONY HAWK GAME IVE EVER PLAYED Well what can i say this was one of da BEST Tony Hawk Video Games too date I mean the plot is sick in its on right You create ur own custom skater whoo goes from bein a street skater too a national skateboardin icon but this game switches its style and plot from The first installment of the T H U G In this installment your picked bye the birdman himslef too lead your team in the world destruction tour which i think is one of da illest ideas U Gotta face up against no one other then Skateboard Bad Boy Himself Bam Margera who in my personal opinion I have been a big fan of Bam and his possie ever since the CKY Video Days And now too have them as Main Charachters in this game is awsome Its Like you got the normal Tony Hawk Skate Team and Then the whole Viva La Bam Cast Aswell Its Just Amazing The Story mode is the best ive seen yet in the Franchise This game is so Addictingly Fun I Recommend this Game 100 Personally i think this title would of fit it so much better Tony Hawks Underground 2 World Destuction Tour PS The newest installment of the Tony Hawk Franchise Just Dropped 3 Days Ago Tony Hawks American Wasteland And too tell you the truth i think this game is still a little bit better maybe its just because this game had the whole Viva La Bam cast in it too give it that crazy feel But To me this is still the undisputed Champ of thhe Tony Hawk Franchise FOR NOW 
2 great Final Fantasies from the SNES era These 2 games are probably in my opinion anyway the best ones in the series I will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself FF5 One of the previously unreleased FF games at the time anyway is now in America I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof I literally trained my characters this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game to get to level 30 or 40 can t remember exactly just to get my jobs mastered the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of X Death rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him her instead of the one who is destroying the world the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters there s only 5 in the entire game you stick with 4 one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters FF6 I think this is the best one in the series there is absolutly no real Main character in this game For those who are confused what I mean is that well for example FF7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is Cloud the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader The characters are excellent in this game I pretty much like all of them Gau is funny but he doesn t have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you can t even control them at all during battle Sabin having the Blitz ability for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move no matter which direction your facing you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction for instance one of the moves is RLR I am talking about Right Left Right on the control pad and if your character is facing to the right then you have to insert that command but if you are facing the opposite direction it is still the same command not the opposite combination when I first beat the game before beating it I got all of the characters to level 99 This game also has some of the best music for a FF game at the time anyway the collection itself you get a music CD the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8 s random battle loading screen FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies has CGI cinemas FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES or should I say Super Famicom version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features overall If you like the SNES FF games this is the right collection for you Along with Chronicles which includes FF4 FF2 in the USA for the SNES and Chrono Trigger 
An awesome game I had heard of how amazing Final Fantasy VI was supposed to be So I thought I have to get this game even if to just fill out my Final Fantasy collection First off I will start with V I had heard from many sources that this game wasn t very good I in fact find it just as good as VI VI is just as good as I was expecting It s funny and has very memorable characters and dialog My only problem with the two games is that there is a bit of a lag The lag is not bad at all in V but is pretty noticable in VI While it was a minor inconvience to me most people may find it more irritating Don t get me wrong I don t think the lag is enough to actually mess you up but it can get a little annoying Overall I got two great games for the price of one bargain game I must say I am completely satisfied 
Arrived Quickly This product arrived quickly and in excellent shape Thanks for being a quality shop This product is hard to find in a store Thanks again 
Good Fun Best fighting game I have played in a long time The characters are coo 
big superhero game fan This isn t much like the spiderman games that i m used to but it is definitely a lot of fun Good storyline for a fighting game The single player is challenging but beatable and uses most if not all the characters There are plenty of characters and most are different and have unique powers There are two versus modes against the computer or against a friend The computer is pretty easy to beat Each character has it s own pros and cons Another thing i like is that the character levels aren t the same anybody remember super smash bros In most games there are a lot of different people but they re mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end I actually got bored and a little dissappointed after playing this a couple of days but a little while ago i started playing again and it is awesome recommended for comic book fans 
Nancy Drew Rocks I ve done most of the Nancy Drew games now and a couple CSI and Law and Order games Nancy Drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than CSI I also had so many problems with bugs with the CSI and Law and Order games not so with Nancy Drew And a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me 
Fast moving This game was great It s easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast In this one Nancy is on a train that might be haunted Lori Girard your host invites a bunch of people including Frank and Joe Hardy you actually get to play as Frank in one part of the game Then odd things start happening on the train Lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train s emergency brake is pulled This is a really fun game 
A Train Bound For Adventure Nancy Drew Last Train To Blue Moon Canyon 13 Before I Begin My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in depth look at that topic If you hate reading medium long reviews or just don t have the patience I would not continue reading but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you ll continue Gameplay Interface This is a point and click mystery the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use They also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game The hands manipulate items or add them to your Inventory Toolbox When playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a Inventory Depicted as a toolbox which I think should be a backpack instead a Camera Cell phone and a Journal Help and a Menu Button Other games have a Coin Purse when money is used in the game The Main Menu is pretty simple However the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you can t delete saved games It also prompts you about your decision it makes saving rewriting games take more than one click For this type of game the interface is perfect but I ll knock off a star for the irritating save load page Plot A fairly used plot in this series finding treasure But Her Interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting Jake Hurly a miner and owner of a custom built train falls in love with a young French woman named Camille on the way to finding gold Camille later dies Jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now haunted train is found out in out in the Nevada desert with the engineer dead Many years later Lori Girard Daddy s little fame seeking rich girl finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to Copper Gorge Colorado She invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to Jake Hurley and where his mine is using the clues Jake left on the train A pretty simple treasure story This series often uses that story but in different ways now turned into a intriguing mystery good work Her Interactive The game also has some side mysteries like Lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake Both happen to be publicity stunts But you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened What I didn t like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed The very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is The Jake Hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub plot s weren t very exciting Characters I loved the characters but you couldn t really interact with them as much Lori Girard was one of my favorite characters I loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting Nancy s name Since Lori is the hostess she was probably the main character Tino Baldcucci is a great character as well He is a Private Investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time He is as conceited as Lori you ll probably interact with him a lot more than John Grey John Grey is the first black male to be in this series he is the host of Ghost Hunters a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts He s a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately Then there is Charleena Purcell a romance novelist introduced in Nancy Drew Secret Of Shadow Ranch 10 who is nice and very smart She is in the process of making her book that s on a deadline who you ll find out used one of Lori s story ideas in her latest book without permission I like her better now then when she was in ND 10 to bad she has no memory of that game And finally there is Frank Joe Hardy These teenage brothers work for American Teens Against Crime ATAC and who were invited because their dad was friends with Lori s dad The boys were nice enough to invite Nancy along as well I personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as Frank as a short order cook They really don t have much to do with the case they are just a good source of info I am looking forward to playing as them more in Nancy Drew Creature Of Kapu Cave 15 I really didn t like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game But when you did interact at times it was really fun That s something to add to ND 16 and beyond Setting Graphics I love being on a train the feel was so exciting Seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great The cars were so detailed and beautiful I think my favorite place in the train was the Projection Car Later you stop at Copper Gorge a little town in Colorado There was the mysterious crypt and a Museum Taffy Shop that was cheesy but enjoyable The crypt was small and there wasn t much to do but I mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn The graphics were great Very realistic Its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better This was probably the most unique setting in the series I personally love trains boats and planes so this made me really happy Puzzles Activities The puzzles were fairly easy I liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where Jake s mine is What was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles There were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying You also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones tools duct tape a pen and other stuff I don t understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with Tino to get a simple pen Some of the puzzles were unique like Camille s doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step playing Camptown Races on the piano and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale But some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations a word search and a two memory games This game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score Ending Once you find out where Jake s Mine your sent off there to get a head start for a treasure You d think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else You open the entrance memorize a couple things follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized Not that difficult if you are smart Then you find the treasure and your so called culprit You wouldn t know this person is the culprit when he she finds you in the mine and talks to you but then he she loses trust in you and you get caved in Then you get out I thought this was fun to do felt like a roller coaster to stop the culprit I liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy Although the culprit was kind of obvious I liked what the culprit s plan or goal was Overall it was good ending yet a little easier than I thought it should have been Overall This was one of the better Nancy Drew games out there Definitely one to add to your shelf The flaws in this game don t affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different The plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it I enjoyed this game a lot after I played it more than two times I think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience Some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts The repetition of some of the puzzles isn t too bad This game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best Nancy Drew game It really depends on your opinion Add all these up and divide by 6 4 s Gameplay Interface 4 s Plot 4 s Characters 5 s Setting Graphics 3 s Puzzles 4 s Ending = 24 Stars Divide By 6 Categories = 4 Stars Thanks for reading 
This is the coolest mystery game made This is a great game for puzzel lovers and isn t easy This is a great game to play on stormy dark night Sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save Just when you think you have it figured out something new happens Even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time Trust me you will never be bored 
Clue Fatal Illusion I dont know what everyone else s reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome The graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful There s a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it The ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours not all at once of course to solve this mystery It s a really great buy Andre 
Clue Chronicles Fatal Illusion I absolutely loved this game I couldn t stay off my computer it was addicting The game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking It was very entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery I can t wait until the next one comes out 
Top 3 PS2 game ever This game is simply awesome I received it for a gift last Christmas and I still love it The graphics action are amazing it s not available on XBOX If you don t already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece You ll love it The main character Kratos reminds me of Quan chi in Mortal Kombat Looking forward to God of War 2 
One of the best action games PERIOD You ve read a lot of reviews to get to this one most likely and they ve gone on about how great it looks it does look tremendous how fantastic the gameplay is it is awe inspiring and how just absolutely great of a gaming experience it is There are a few things that I would like to add First off there is one slight problem with the game Personally with action games of the 3rd person variety I like to be able to control the camera This game does not have that Instead you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see This is a very slight complaint and one I m hoping will be improved with GOD OF WAR II The second thing that I would like to add is that the Mythological aspect of this game is GREAT It really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games It s the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would It s a tremendously entertaining and oft times thought provoking game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice em dice em games of this type get to Get it 
The best slash and hack game for PS2 ever created It s worth playing and spending hours of playing Warning This game is rated Mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids Nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc No need to buy the walkthrough because the game it s not really that difficult Can t wait for God of War 2 that will come out 2007 which luckily for PS2 instead of PS3 
Believe the hype For all you non believers out there BUY THIS GAME I was like you reading the reviews looking at the box in various stores pondering considering thinking to myself should I buy this game Now that I finally spent the mere 20 and played the game I am wondering why I didn t do so sooner As an avid Playstation supporter Stood in line for hours and paid over 600 for my PS2 back in the day this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment Cinematically driven storyline supurbly coordinated character control creative levels and character design great soundtrack decent bosses pretty cool power moves and importantly puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns In closing all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review BUY THIS GAME 
Nice to have these games Amazon com has listed this as the King s Quest Compilation instead of the King s Quest Collection which is clearly printed on my box for the game as well as the picture on the website I don t know why that is As for the game itself I remember loving the King s Quest games when I was younger I bought this game mostly for King s Quest VI which so far has seemed to work fine with the exception of one time when the game kicked me out for no apparent reason This particular version of King s Quest VI also seems to draw it s graphics from the original release of the game and not the CD release later on so that was also somewhat disappointing Captain Saladin no longer looks like Lassie Overall it s nice to have access to these games for nostalgia 
There is no substitue for excellency These games represent glory days in the age of computing Like classic movies they will ALWAYS have a place and be replicated though never duplicated Let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IN ALL CAPS CALL ON VIVENDI TO GIVE THOSE INCREDIBLE DESIGNERS OF THE SILVER LINING FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL SUPPORT 
freakin sweet this game is just freakin awesome im not that big into video games and i really only play them when i have someone to play against i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack then came duty i played this game through on all the difficulty modes from medium up and never got bored plus if you ve got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking multiplayer is sweet esp if you break up into teams and you can talk smack all day long best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen 
Amazing game couldn t put it down Great game higly addictive and gets really tuff once you play on veteran s mode Definately a game to have in your collection 
Great game Buy call of duty 3 in november This game is amazing the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode Sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle One time I was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game Only three shots will kill you I HAD TO restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it 
COD2 is packed with awesome WW2 action Call of Duty 2 puts you in the role of three different people Vasili John Davis and Bill Taylor during three highly intense but different WW2 campaigns You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes so in otherwords its a first person shooter Anyway you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks MP40s M1 Garands Thompsons etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks Ontop of that you get smoke frag grenades to toss around at will There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun you pick a team ie British Nazis Americans you get it and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room snipe out mortar teams fend off a massive German counterattack or place a bomb on something Its pretty fun and intense because you ll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels I want to stress the word intense on this game You will always be on your toes always firing at hordes of enemies This game isn t easy even on the easy difficulty and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc if you think Medal of Honor Frontline s Arnhem Knights level is difficult wait till you see this Also this game is pretty long so don t try rushing it hah Moving on you ll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt France Russia and even Germany I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close and the character models look amazing However the levels feel kind of linear You are pretty limited as to where you can go but I guess we can look past that The sound effects were great I really loved the explosions The voice acting was great and actually helpful because your allies would be like Kraut on the 2nd floor black building and basically point out enemies to you What lowered this game from being a 9 Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death Ontop of that the guns weren t very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over got up and shot me again Meh Also like I mentioned the objectives started to get repetitive The ending was kind of a rip off at first a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won but once the credits roll the real ending begins It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks nazis and airplanes It was like watching a movie To sum it all up if you got an X Box 360 then you need to play this game It isn t the best in my opinion but it sure is a lot of fun Go buy it 
Revolutionary for me Let me explain oh my friends Little history Started playing shooters on PC when I was a youngin Quake was the first Quake II followed III Unreal Unreal Tournament A few lesser titles in between All multiplayer mind you Since I was a kid there was always something so divinely mind boggling about being able to link up different machines at that time computers and not only participate but kill your friends with ultra cool weapons and the like in literally a universe outside our own And truly is there anything cooler It s like psychically connecting with your friends in a lucid dream only peppered with a concrete universe filled with its own physics and laws The point of divuldging into this intimate joy of mine on paper Ever since I ve been introduced to this experience of multiplayer I have pretty much neglected single player in all games like a deformed foster child with epilepsy So why is Call of Duty 2 for Xbox 360 revolutionary for a gamer such as myself It converted me From what you ask From PC to console I defiantly backed my beliefs console could not and hadn t objective fact I d say come close to the PC in regards to multiplayer gaming First person shooters only solidified the argument For one you ve got a mouse which undeniably offers a more precise degree of control I played Mario Brothers on a controller but after playing Goldeneye on Nintendo 64 whenever I attended a friends house way back when I shuddered with disgust A controller couldn t touch what I was used to not to mention the fact that you re playing on a full screen with a computer at a very accomplished speed opposed to split screen on the console which had one dared play four player reached framerates of dire levels not unlike viewing screenshots on the net and I exaggerate only slightly So here comes Call of Duty 2 for the Xbox 360 For starters I only bought the system because a friend convinced me and I was actually impulsive about it which I m usually not Had Project Gotham Racing for a while which was actually pretty fun online if a bit hard and I was never into racing games Few weeks later I bought the Duty and I was impressed Let me just say off the bat that as many know the first many months of the game s existence the online play would become unplayable when a certain amount of people clogged a server Sometime back now however the guys FINALLY released a patch and the game now works as well as it possibly could Now this is why the game refuses to let me abandon it The graphics are very good and perhaps more importantly the framerate is excellent A reoccuring problem among past console shooters Halo and Halo 2 prayed it could touch 60 frames per second like CoD2 that had yet to be overcome we now finally have a game that runs silky smooth 95 of the time practically unaffected by the number of players on the screen or the viewing distance on larger levels It s gloriously smooth and I am completely obsessive about this sort of thing Add to this the graphical prowess which too is stunning despite an overall but in my opinion inconsequential semi lack of detail in textures and you ve got a gaming universe that is good to go for even the most demanding lowlife The control with great help from the consistent framerate is good Once you ve gotten used to it it radiates Best I ve used on a console beating out even the Halo s which I dabbed in for a bit via friends due again to the huge improvement in the rendering speed of the graphics It becomes intuitive but with the constant ability to probe deeper into skill level I personally play on the high sensitivity setting and while I m still not as good as I would be with a mouse theorhetically I am good far better than I could have ever imagined with a controller Net code is delicious Even with pings of up to 2 300 KIND of stretching it you have very little disadvantage over even the host Because of the way it works you aren t shooting and having it shoot 2 seconds later However it does it it does but it compensates for the latency and there is practically no unfair play as a result This whole point is of immense value because along with the awesome graphics and speed the netcode offers essentially no determent of any kind Overall this all adds up to a near perfect online gaming experience that is as good as any I ve played on PC just stunning Oh yeah and Xbox Live s interface with the whole friend s dealie Brilliant Get with friends in seconds at any point in time The microphone of course adds to the greatness of an already great experience The game It s fun as anything The weapons are awesome Sound effects blast and make for totally satisfying kills Everything is well balanced despite the fact that lesser skilled players will say snipers outweigh all other weapons Maps overall are wonderfully designed and dynamic Personally I m still into the standard modes of play there are five deathmatch and team deathmatch and they are a riot It all works beautifully It s FUN so fun and consequently can become like a powerful drug Hmmm So yeah five stars without any hesitation whatsoever based simply on multiplayer It is the one game that has never for a second made me regret the purchase of a 360 
Flawed but fun I agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status That being said I spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game Well worth the cost and enjoyable I am not familiar with the other Civ games and was looking more for a city building game set in the past similar to my favorite game Children of the Nile perhaps that explains why I was not disappointed 
Gothic 2 Gold Very good overall graphic voices good sometimes funny sometimes sarcastic PC Game should have a Readme file that gives maps and walkthroughs 
Fun Game i luv to play This game is awesome I love to play it and i play it everyday In school it gets me way far ahead and much quicker too at math The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out and sometimes it won t take your answer this happens sometimes but it kind of stinks because your getting tested so when it won t take it it counts it as wrong But i gotta say don t let this little thing stop you from buying this game It will kill alot of time On long trips i always take it and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds It totally rocks i used to get car sick because i was bored and just sitting in the car but now i don t get car sick at all because im doing something else This game has made me good and quick at math in my school It really helped This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it 
Brain Training I love this game I love the training exercises being able to compare them with other who creat files on my game and I especially love the Sudokus I feel smarter already 
The Brain Workout Thinking Analyzing Solving Problems Reading Logic These are just some of the skills that Brain Age will help you develop or re develop No it s not Resident Evil or Splinter Cell But it is as fun and addictive it s certainly as challenging if not more challenging and it s a nice pallet cleanser from the plethora of pure entertainment value games that my kids and I play Brain Age is a bit advanced at times for my grade schoolers but the parts that they do get really help them develop the skills that they are concurrently working on in school Big Brain Academy is a much easier not better alternative for younger children There s a daily training area that gives your skills a workout And there s a test area that challenges you to quickly and accurately work through various tasks then provides you with a calculation of your Brain Age based on how well you did on the test Sudoku has it s own area to train the brain on number logic Kids reading this will NO vote me to death for saying this but this is a great game for parents to get for their kids It s one of the only ones Big Brain Academy is the other that I never take away from my own kids when they ve misbehaved or simply just had too much video gaming They never complain One word of advice Brain Age has a hard time recognizing an 8 if you write it the way you d skate a figure 8 it likes it better when you draw an 8 as two circles on top of each other Addictive fun Buy it 
Great Game Just thought I d share my my opinion I think ID2 is a great game with a very deep lore great graphics replayability and more If your into RPG games this is right up your alley 
Lots of fun not a bad story either Anyone who s a fan of the Black Isle games based on the infinity engine should enjoy this game They changed up the character creation a little so you seemingly have more control over your character s strengths and weaknesses While IWDII doesn t have the depth of Torment or the NPC interaction of the Baldur s Gate series it still has a good story and a nice interface Graphically it s subpar to the NWN series but I think that might actually be a benefit as I found the 3D aspect of NWN to be a hinderence at times Some tips for those interested 1 Make a party of 4 characters They will level up faster and have less hang ups with the AI With 6 members I found I needed to start over and import them into a new game after the prologue because they were under powered and 2 of them always end up wandering off on me Those problems are abated with only 4 characters 2 Multiclassing is key Having thief abilities is nice but you don t really need more than 3 or 4 levels as rogue Sink all the points into picking locks and traps Multiclass into a ranger or mage You won t have to worry about armor hindering thief skills Adding a few levels of fighter to cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills and in the case of a cleric a boost to HP These are just a few ideas 3 For the warriors focus on only a couple differnt weapons Make sure you have at least one of them blunt weapons as some foes aren t as vulnerable to the bladed variety Also have at least 2 members competent with ranged weapons 
Simple yet deep Graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any RPG fan 
One of the best ps2 games around This game is very good They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool The game folows the movies well You can even blow up buildings The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave Lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops 
Money Power and Respect The Godfather The Game allows you to live the Godfather movies The storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well The missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving But overall if your a fan of the Godfather like I am you wont care Respect the Family 
GTA but BETTER This game is pretty much like GTA same sort of graphics same way driving same way shooting but the the better part is the fighting and how u can threaten people on the streets and scare them instead of just killing them This pretty much follows The Godfather movie story line For example Luca Brossi dies and Micheal leaves to Sicily One can create there on MOB face in the game which is really cool Then you get accepted in the Corleone family and even get to talk to the DON himself Unlike other games if your doing a mission with some character to help you that character doesn t die and kills people instead of just standing there My favorite mission is when your with Sonny taking over one of the enemy families warehouse The game is just great and amazing go and buy it 
Amazing at first and even more so in hindsight This game is literally the alpha and the omega of its genre The storyline was great the characters were really good the freedom and depth in the game was almost unbelievable Planes choppers bikes cars you name it Drug dealing gun running cop bribing you name it Even still this game had 2 or 3 pretty big flaws Namely that it is not great graphically but on a strong pc with a good graphics card it is hard to really complain What most bothered me is that on a half dozen or so missions the objective was so poorly phrased so that I ended up spending a few hours trying to do the wrong thing entirely I was flying the plane and trying to land it on a cliff instead of a hit a marker x thousand feet in the air The directions for the mission said take it to the cliff so I did Also some of the missions might take a lot of attempts before you succeed so have patience As lame as my last quasi complaint is I think the storyline could have been longer I wanted to see a few more missions where Carl and Wuzi have fun after the big heist and I wish CJ would have had a definite resolution with Catalina If anyone has not planed any of the GTA games before as I hadn t either then this game might overwhelm you and the first couple nights you will really hate it But if you do buy it be warned this game will take about 2 3 weeks of playing 6 8 hours a day if you want to get close to 100 completion and it is addictive 
Best game yet in GTA series I bought this game a bit late 2 years after It came out but it still seemed state of the art to me Loved the story and gameplay has improved significantly Pros HUGE MAP with 5 massave areas to explore TONS of vehicles you might not see the same one twice Cool new features like vehicle customization Endless stuff to do multiplayer mode Cons character customization prosess can be annoying If you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back ie all your muscle going down Go buy this game you will really like i 
March 6 2006 below has it all backwards The version 2 0 has been altered to remove the ability to hot coffee mod the program This version 2 0 while still containing the violence language and sexual references was altered to remove the ability to de clothe the characters within the game The original release could be altered The version 2 0 was released due to a small public outcry about the nudity AND a few activities that are going on while in the nude Strange when you can remember the reasons why they tried to ban Grand Theft Auto 3 all those years ago This time around they don t even mention violence They are mad now because kids can see people nekkid 
Nice game I like the GTA series of games and this one is great too I can turn up my settings to max My computer is over a year old and there are no problems The kid reviewer claims that he doesn t like the N F bomb That is why this is rated M for Mature so he should not even be playing it To give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated This is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions 
Great game runs perfectly If you liked Vice City you ll love San Andreas With more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better The games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash As a note I had NO problems running this game with pretty much all options on high I run a Dell 8300 3 0 HT 1 GB ram Radeon 9700 PRO and it flies Strap up and get ready to defend your hood 
A Gem This game while simple in it s storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square Enix First Square and Enix merge effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG s of all time Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy Now we have the perfect pairing of wit humor heart and pure Square story Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing The chains you can get going in Sora s attacks are amazing The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding To learn this battle style you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum The battle against Sephiroth one of the best known villians from the Final Fantasy series is awesome I never did beat Sephiroth but the battle was intense and I had him beaten to his knees several times The bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself This game essentially creates a new genre blending a soulful cast with characters from Disney lore The underpinning story is not to be missed be sure you get the extended ending by following the Brady Games guide The summons are a bit hard to leverage but Tinker Bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles 360 degree rotating battles with the Shadow King in the sky above London and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages The secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution 
One of the Best Games Ever I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out My initial thought was what was Squar thinking I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people right before KH2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the 20 to get the game as was the price of the game by then and low and behold by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked I played that game for what seemed like hours on in it was really only a very long weekend But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII my two favorit games in the world I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did It was well worth the price and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner 
good game when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com 
Simply amazing A masterpiece and an instant RPG classic RPG fans won t want to miss this masterful follow up to the legendary Chrono Trigger on Super NES Chrono Cross has turned out to be one of those rare gems that manage that have all the qualities needed in order to make a truly memorable role playing game experience It does just about everything really well and does many things better than the original ever been did before If you re a fan of RPGs there s no doubt that you ll be pleased with this game and owe it to yourself to go out and buy it at your earliest convenience First and foremost the storyline in Chrono Cross is probably the most ambitious that any has ever been carried out in a console RPG with the possible exception of Xenogears The writing quality of Chrono Cross is exceptional and is nearly as good as the brilliant job that was done by the team responsible for Vagrant Story What makes all of this even more impressive is that Square was able to give each of the game s 40 plus playable characters different characteristics and in many cases distinct accents and speech patterns The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game That combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals Without spoiling anything the plot is very elaborate and deals with many issues such as humanity s role in the destruction of the environment and how fate plays a role in our lives Plus it brings forth the idea of parallel worlds and how the outcome of one s life can be greatly effected by what happens during certain significant events in one s life All of this has been pulled together nicely and the end result is one of the most intricate plots that one will ever encounter in a videogame Not to be too cliched but Chrono Cross is a truly epic role playing game experience that has cemented its place in the annals of RPG history It s easily one of the best RPGs currently available on PlayStation and has surpassed Vagrant Story as my personal favorite If you re a fan of role playing games then you must go out and buy a copy of Chrono Cross 
A great game but Misunderstood While it shares the Name Chrono many people think it is a horrible sequel It in fact is not a direct sequel like so many people think it is It is a very well rounded and amazing game to play It follows up twenty years after the Fall of lavos Keep in mind when playing this game that it is a Chronological sequel rather than a direct sequel that so many people fail to realize While the game has numerous playable characters it still maintains a very good story if you follow it closely but at times can become very confusing if you miss certain details Chrono Cross will net you around 30 40 hours of gameplay and if you don t stop playing the game for extended amounts of time the story just becomes completly amazing 
one of the best games ive ever played for any system I ve had this game since the day it came out and some of the cutscenes my opinion are better than a lot of games out today This games unique gameplay i think adds to its satisfactory I love everything about this game for example music this games music is unreal compared to practically every other ps1 game out there IF you take the time to listen to it and your not one of those gamers like i used to be before i actually listened to any games music than u will not be disappointed gameplay I absolutely love this games gameplay because of its unique style Even though u cant really tell how much you have leveled up you can still get the idea from when it gives u a new star so you can learn new moves and more slots for more space new put more skills Charater and attack system there are 40 characters in this game which I think all promote to there own indivituality from the others Some of them may have the same same type and sometimes the same basic idea of a move But each character is uniqely different looking than the others a lot of them use different weapons and armor But the one I like most of all is the way that your special moves for each character get cooler looking and much stronger as you gain stars or levels Some people say that getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes to make this games battle system to easy I dont think that at all because types of people had advantages over others so u have to know that But even if you do the enemies can heal more than you and some enemies you have to run from because their so hard So i dont think its that simple Challenge level I think overall this game is very challenging because of the battle system and because there is a countless of puzzles to figure out in the game that definetly add to the games difficulty I also think the games length adds to its challenge meter because there are so many different paths you can take in the game to change the story line so you can get different characters So if you dont get some the first time you play you can start another game with the same data and everything as the game before So I think that this game is a game that you can t beat so easily in one day I would recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style and amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one of the best games ever created to date 
addicting Had this game on our gamecube so addicting then now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff You have to get a certain rating I believe like A D nonetheless it is a great game worth the money If you have kids the kids will thoroughly enjoy 
The best Mario Kart up to date If you are a DS owner this game is a must have You will not be disappointed 
Great Game Lots of fun What a fun game The graphics are good The stereo sound is awesome There are plenty of tracks and it s got multi player We ve had a blast with this one High quality fun from Nintendo 
Good for the kiddies I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases is that right ago and i gotta say it was alright the pros are that it is up to four players so if dad wants to spend quality time with junior it has a wide variety of fun characters and plenty of levels HOWEVER it lacks graphics and young children might not do well during the game but overall its alright Graphics C It must have been released early cuz it s pretty bad Sound B+ crisp sounds the sound really matches the mood Controls A Changing and controlling characters a breeze Good for children and adults to 
Be Patient but kids can do it too My just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he can t do a VERY few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy I had to finally defeat for him BUT he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters It has a tad more killing of stuff than I care for but what doesn t these days He likes being able to be different characters his favorite is Puss n Boots As a grown up I enjoyed it as well especially the humor 
A Fun Game But the graphics are pretty imbarasing The object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions levels and Hero Times a specific mission were you use one character Some of the levels are fun like the Far Far Away level it has a Grand Theft Auto Theme I give the graphics a 3 5 I think they should have done a better job on the main characters audio 4 5 gameplay 4 5 5 fun a 4 5 5 and an overall of 3 5 
Amazing Movie=Great Game The Incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being The Incredibles even though it is short Pros Amazing Characters Great Graphics Intresting Plot Footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artwork Cons Short Only 1 player Overall If you loved The Incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well The same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy 
Not To Bad Of A Game This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either Of course the movie is way better than the game The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again All in all it s a good game I would recommend it The graphics are good I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie It s not to bad of a game to play 
Movie Great Game Horrible I know how you feel about the Incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie Dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys Violet is just running around invisible Elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys Plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile Wasn t the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no I in team Well you are all by you re self in this playing one charcter per level Please note all movies made into games are ba 
Finally Cooperative Mode in an Xbox 360 Title What can be better than a game made for adults or kids Sly sneaky humor that only adults will understand with the greatest toy ever created Legos All in the theme of the best of the Star Wars movies Many games put in replayability by allowing you to go through the game or missions a second or third time with a different character but Lego Star Wars does this in a fashion that is totally fun It s not a simple regurgitation of the map with a different character wihoo replayable but rather an ingenious method that rewards you with additional pieces for building as well as secret areas that were previously unobtainable For instance you might need a Stormtrooper or uniform a Jedi dark or light or even a Bounty Hunter to enter specific areas Droids are often used to access areas as well but you usually have them during the missions Using free play mode you can go back through the missions with a character you created or any other character you have unlocked During the mission you can cycle through your characters and use their abilities This allows you to go back and unlock new areas and find additional bricks etc The fact that there are new abilities with characters you find later as well as new areas to explore really makes the replayability fun and worthwhile Another aspect to this game that I absolutely love is cooperative play This is great for adults to be able to play along with the kids or even spouses My wife doesn t play a lot of Xbox titles but she loves playing this game and we have a blast going through the missions together I m surprised more games don t actually give you coop play like this Seems it s enough to toss in death match and label the game as multiplayer My only complaint is with the camera both in single and cooperative mode Often times the camera will shift based on one of the players and force the other player back towards the center of the screen On more than one occasion this has caused death to the characters or when we get stuck forces one of the players to swap characters midstream Sometimes this isn t obvious to the player It would have been really nice to have the option of split screen especially with the real estate an HDTV provides All in all I would highly recommend this game Especially if you have kids and want to spend some quality time with them Great game 
Fun Game Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don t regret I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time Would not say it s one of the very bests available in its category but it s interesting and fun About graphics though the details are not great still I liked the 3 D view specially the view through the eyes of the main character Hero Story is so so Dialogs are specially bad But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea A sort of combination of RPG and RTS I like the units and the way they fight Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good Overall it s a nice game And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay 
RPG meets RTS I ve never played real time strategy games before because I primarily play RPG s This game combines the best elements of both and I ve enjoyed playing it immensly I look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters 
A Phenominal Value Essentially this Platinum Edition DVD is three games for a bargain bin price I couldn t pass it up I had a little trouble getting it to launch at first but after a little Internet session I was back in the world of RPG RTS hybrid excellence The seamless integration of the two elements makes for a truly unique experience Unlike other RTS games there are many adventure elements and you aren t just plunked down on each map you have to fight your way from map to map Unlike other RPG games your hero won t be able to go it alone to defeat the foes that lay in their path he she will have to call upon the power of armies from six different races Human Elves Dwarves Orcs Trolls and Dark Elves Your avatar must find structures known as rune monuments to access his her unique power of using runes to summon forth rune heroes and armies The RPG element of the game is limited essentially to the character you create at the beginning Your avatar a rune warrior is a remnant of powerful heroes that served the Circle Mages during the time of The Convocation The avatar is completely under your control you choose the name equipment gender and distribute skill points and stat points as they gain levels to create a unique character You can create a punishing melee fighter a powerful sorcerer a deadeye archer or any combination of those and other concepts Your avatar can also summon rune heroes as he she goes along these heroes are other rune warriors whose levels and classes are fixed so all you can do is equip them with the best available items As you progress through the game you can find more powerful hero runes to summon better heroes at the hero monuments The RTS element is a continuation of the system started in Warcraft but with a few twists You must find a rune monument for one of the six races human monument dwarf monument etc and possess the appropriate worker rune building plans and unit plans to summon an army Once you summon your workers they can gather resources and build the necessary structures to summon an army The need to have the appropriate building and unit plans occasionally necessitates fully exploring each map so as to not miss any The levels of your military units depends on the level of the worker rune you used to summon your workers so as you find higher level worker runes your units will gain levels and become stronger Heart of Winter and Shadow of the Phoenix help add dozens of hours to the original Order of Dawn campaign granting you access to higher levels more powerful equipment new heroes and more advanced units One of my favorites was the Walking Fortress troll unit that hurls massive boulders at enemy structures You can import your avatar from The Order of Dawn into both expansions allowing this hero to complete an epic adventure Shadow of the Phoenix is very challenging and has some of the most ridiculous boss fights I have ever seen Several of them require your avatar the rune heroes and a full army to bring down a single foe Heart of Winter is an excellent continuation of The Order of Dawn adding new friends and enemies and Shadow of the Phoenix is a harrowing and challenging test of strategy and patience as your rune hero moves towards their ultimate destiny To sum it up this DVD has plenty of adventurous RTS RPG action wrapped around an engrossing fantasy yarn that should provide dozens of hours of quality entertainment Highly recommended 
Great game Worth the money get lots of hours out of it yet is closr to warcraft civilization style gam 
This is too cute I had an old skool ds and it was ok When they released the lite I was skeptical about it It was right after the Microsoft 360 scandal and I was critical of new technology I wanted to wait until it had been out a few months to pick one up to see if it had any glitches I m glad I waited because they released the coral pink one I picked it up the first day and it s so adorable and perfect The ability to change the light levels is great the old ds was hard to play outside because you couldn t really adjust the lighted screen It s a soft pink color glossy and tiny I marveled at it s size compared to the old ds It s super hot The charger from the old ds DOES NOT fit into the ds lite so if you have the old charger old car charger it won t work That s not such a big deal since it comes with a charger but I was kinda sad that the old car charger wouldn t fit The stylus is better with a soft rubber tip instead of the hard plastic one the old ds had The colors on it are amazing The sound is pretty loud I find that I don t have to have it up very much to hear it fine I m glad nintendo finally realized that not every gamer is a d00d 
Nintendo does it again Nintendo DS Lite 2006 INTRODUCTION In late 2004 Nintendo premiered the Nintendo Dual Screen or Nintendo DS for short Despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike the new console quickly won audiences over It was Nintendo s best handheld console to date And in 2006 Nintendo released a smaller lighter version of the system appropriately called the DS Lite OVERVIEW Nintendo released the DS Lite in mid 2006 The new version of the system is smaller than the old version features repositioned buttons switches etc variable brightness levels and a few other changes from the classic DS It retails for about 130 00 and comes in three colors White Black and Pink REVIEW Nintendo did a good job revising the DS Many problems with the older version of the system are fixed Here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version THE GOOD SMALLER AND MORE COMPACT THAN THE ORIGINAL DS The original DS was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market and it was kind of a pain to haul around Finally we ve got a smaller lighter version of the system that can easily be transported VARIABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS You can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the DS Brighter levels use more battery power lower levels use less so you can plan out how best to use your battery s life FEATURES A CLIP IN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SLOT Unlike the original DS the Lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where Game Boy Advance games fit This helps to give the system a streamlined appearance and it keeps that slot cleaner COMPATIBLE WITH THE E READER The old DS due to its shape couldn t use the E Reader accessory The Lite model s shape is better all around and it can use it AVAILABLE IN THREE COOL COLORS Whether you want white black or pink there s a color for everyone REPOSITIONED BUTTONS AND THINGS Nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use REDESIGNED STYLUS The new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old DS and is an all around improvement COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER DS Since it s basically the same system you won t have any compatibility issues THE BAD SMALLER ISN T NECESSARILY BETTER IN EVERY WAY I have big hands and they fit the old DS fine Shrinking it actually makes it a little harder in some aspects to use all of the buttons STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRE GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES Of course I wasn t really expecting Nintendo to fix this STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAME BOY ADVANCE MULTIPLAYER Another thing I wasn t expecting fixed OVERALL Overall this is a nice improvement over the original DS There are problems but for the most part just the same problems the original had If you haven t gotten a DS yet definitely go for the Lite model EDITION NOTES The DS Lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come 
Lighter is Better People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money It can be that way if you think of yourself as a sucker but for me the DS lite is a little better Simply put if you re content with your original DS then don t even waste time to buy this one If you don t have a DS period the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one With the DS Lite gameplay is made a little simplar The button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better For one the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance This makes handling some of the functions especially for GBA games a lot easier The buttons sadly are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge called a cap If you don t have a GBA game plugged into the system you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there However when you do stick in a GBA game it sticks out by about a centimeter It just looks weird The cap does at least keep the system looking good Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen The original DS screen was not exactly bright In fact it was in comparison the DS Lite rather dark Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be On this new screen the difference in how bright the games appear really shows Not only that but you can adjust the brightness if need be It doesn t really affect the battery life either You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original And also like the original it charges while you play Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself These screens last a lot longer than the original DS Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus To the point where it was noticeable You could still see the screen but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it The screen is more protected here The stylus doesn t scratch the screen quite as easily In other words the touch screen lasts a lot longer The DS Lite also looks better and fits in your pocket better It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS For example if you re playing a game and you suddenly have to go just flip it closed and it sleeps There s also a place to store the stylus and the stylus is better too It s a little bigger and thicker so it s not quite as easy to lose Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however You still can t play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite Also you still can t configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier In other words you can t configure X and Y when you play a GBA game This probably won t bother you in the long run however Also the touch screen still has its sensitivity Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore it won t respond to the touch of even your stylus When the original DS launched owners will note that there were not very many good games availible About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS Now there are plenty of games out there and not all of them are ports so if you do want a DS this is a great time to get one and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far The DS may not play movies or MP3 players but to be honest that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center Of course not I m looking to find a system to play some of my games on and the Nintendo DS delivers Real gamers know it s about the games not about the bells and whistles of a system For the casual gamer the Nintendo DS delivers and the DS Lite is a fine improvement The Good +Vastly superior to the original DS +It fits in your pocket easier +The Screen is much brighter +Touch screen is more durable +The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier +A better stylus +The battery life is unchanged The Bad Those with an original DS who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS Some of the cons of the original DS are still her 
A game you can t put down I have been a staunch Final Fantasy fan for years While waiting for the newest release which kept being pushed back I tried out Xenosaga Let me tell you I am grateful I have This game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games I have ever played The world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique not to mention a plot that has profound depth You will fall in love trust me If you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours it is Xenosaga 
One of the best RPG s ever War has erupted between humans and an alien life force known as the Gnosis Man is in danger if nothing is done soon That s where Shion Uzuki the designer for the Anti Gnosis Weapons System known as KOS MOS comes in This game has a splendid opening it really gets you thinking about life itself the subtitle is also a book written by a philospher Anyway you start out on a space ship that is creating the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis However before completion the Gnosis attack your ship and KOS MOS starts herself up by herself From then on your basically thrown around to different areas exploring multiple storylines and trying to figure out why everything is happening The graphics in this game are similar to that of an anime game The characters have big googly eyes and look a little cartoonish especially Shion That s what really sets the mood for the game though The battle system is really unique and unlike any I have tried Basically you have physical or ether like magic attacks If you choose to guard during a turn the AP gauge will go up allowing you to do an extra more powerful combo Once you level up a lot you ll gain more of these powerful end moves that will allow you to defeat stronger enemies You re not limited to just the characters you also have AGWS units which are basically mechs I really was not disappointed in this game I loved it better than any RPG yes even FFVII This a great game for the PS2 collection I would highly recommend it 
Uhhh it keeps you online Hello all uhh there s not really much to this card but yeah it keeps you online for another year which is good its 50 bucks for the year long which is very cheap so yeah go out and buy this if your online PS online people add me my tag is Smiling Bob117 
Waste of money because of shipping charges The price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping Express or about 7 Office Depot who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not Amazon This much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke 
xbox rocks This site is the cheapest I have found for this card 60 br 62 Do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card 60 br 62 It s alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year 
Superior Handheld Nintendo has dominated the handheld industry since the GameBoy came out Now that Sony has stepped in some predicted that their hold might finally be breaking Not so and there is no better proof than the DS Lite The Lite is an evolutionary step over the original DS similar to the GameBoy Advance SP It has a more compact form factor brighter screens a side mounted power button weighs less has longer battery life and simply looks more fashionable The basic functionality of the DS is still here same buttons and general button layout wi fi GBA compatibility etc Is this worth buying if you already have a DS Maybe if you ve got some spare cash Is this worth buying if you don t own a DS Definitely The design is far superior to the old DS No DS review would be complete without further mention of the PSP While the PSP is undoubtedly a more capable device it has significant weaknesses compared to the DS Particularly PSP games tend to have far longer load times it has much shorter battery life and the hardware itself is more fragile Oh and of course there s the cost The most critical factor however is the library of games available As of now DS games are more and better and there s simply no contest when it comes to which has more to offer in this department Games are what really make or break a console and the wide variety of excellent casual and immersive DS titles make it a clearcut winner 
Great with friends While I only own one game for the DS what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend s house with several other people all playing Mario Kart against each other and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used depending on preference Others like Mario Kart stick to the standard controls and others require the use of just the touch screen creating a very unique kind of game The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS it is worth it if it will be your only DS The Lite is better shaped has a better battery life and better brighter screens The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console 
Nintendo DS Lite Polar White At the time white was the only option Red would have pleased my child more I ve found SP games which claim to work with the wireless attachement do NOT work communicate with DS games But as for the DS Lite its a reasonable size perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer Now they offer Pink and Black which is nice but exchangable covers would have been nice The stylus is just barely managable for Adult hands but work fine for my child The screens are bright and no longer dimmable backlighting could be turned off in the SP One nice feature is many games allow some amout of co play with another DS even if your partner doesn t have a copy Stores like GameStop often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games Thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle so that s a bummer The biggest pain yet is I have not found a cable to communicate between the DS Lite and the SP one does exist for the DS to SP Oh an the power supply cable is different as well So while less bulky and better layout the DS Lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between SP and DS first versions not Lite Such is the proprietary way I d really like to see more adult software for these things They are not far from a PDA with their audio recognition and handwriting as well 
GREAT I had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario Two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as long as you do full charge during the night I was a game watch gameboy PSP player but once you start to use this machine you will instantly understand why this game machine became mega hit machine EASILY I am planning to purchase another one for my younger daughter to let them enjoy communication system with 2 machines 
Love it I bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that I havent been able to play it too often It was taken away from me heheheheh So my review is his and he sais that it deserves FIVE STAR 
Best and Cheapest Cheat Device for PS2 This is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the PS2 For all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research I can figure out a way to solve the problem and I m only 13 You are all over 21 AR Max Memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away Yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that s the price for cheating Who ever said that cheating would be fair Overall besides the Max Memory portion this item is great 
Cheating The PS2 There are just so many different ways you can add a cheat into a game and beat the game You can either try the hard way through practice or you can access and enter a cheat code that was created by the compant that created the game or you can just enhance it Thanks to the people at Datel you can definitely punch in those codes with the Action Replay Max for the Playstation 2 It is simple and easy to operate There are also sveral different codes that are preloaded for so many excititng games like Madden 06 Jak Daxter or Need For Speed Underground 2 This is an absolute delight for anybody who owns a Playstation 2 and for anybody who definitely wants a shortcut to beating the game Price B+ Convience B 1 2+ Overall B 
Great game and not a bad price I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok I mean it also comes with chrono trigger if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger 
One of the other FF collections to have This collection isn t as bonus feature happy as Anthology was this version of FF4 2 in the USA at the time of the SNES Genesis era hasn t changed that much the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version the switch between field world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era 7 8 9 Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version Squaresoft at the time put a S load of cinemas mainly ending cinemas has a list of music from the game and other stuff The gameplay is still the same with the exception of what I said earlier which is good otherwise unlike Anthology this collection has no bonus music CD for those who care anyway this is still worth owning anyway 
One of my all time favorite games This is a really nice remake of a great classic FFIV They improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items The challenge level however was bumped up significantly The game was originally paced so you didn t have to spend nearly as much time leveling up A few of the bosses surprised me this time through I ve played the SNES version multiple times in my day The story is unchanged however A must have for any FF Classic RPG fan As a bonus I finally got to play Chrono Trigger 
Good title for cRPG fans This is a good collection It s even better if you have a PS1 emulator and a fast PC This would cut down on the lag Of course if you have such other options arise Some have mentioned the lag issue As one who played through these on the SNES I can assure you there is horrid lag The PS2 has a faster CD drive and some form of caching for PS1 titles which helps dramatically but by no means removes the delay In Chrono Trigger on the console fights started with no discernable lag The creatures on the background jump out at you and you re fighting with no visible delay beyond the jumping animation or whatever they do In FF2 4 the screen did fade black and then faded in but this took about an eighth to quarter of a second estimated Chrono Trigger was a great game The story is fun and the characters are great The story is non linear and you get a great feeling of control How many games give you the choice of killing off one of the bosses or accepting their help Your choice affects the ending in a reasonable fashion FF2 4 was also a great story When I played through it first I commented how it felt like playing through a book Much less choice in progression than even in earlier FF s though Fun regardless Finally he sound quality was lower on the PS version than on the original console The fade effects on the music and such are gone I haven t played through sufficiently to notice any other changes but that one was rather glaring I really liked the use of fadeing to make it sound like you were getting away from the source Such as the Millineal Fair music fading as one wanders away from town The PS version rather ungraciously terminates at some distance and then at some further distance fires up the new music Jarring The original Chrono Trigger would get 5 5 but these issues particularly hinder it 
Great collection This disc set contains two spectacular games Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger Both of the games are wonderful I have played every version of Final Fantasy IV the Japanese version fan translated the English version on the SNES and the remade version on the PSX I loved all three versions Final Fantasy IV s storyline is great The plot starts right away The storylien is gripping and it makes you feel a lot of symphathy for the characters All of the characters have well developed personalities and this game has a quest for redemotion It shows that people can change When Cecil is in a situation where he must choose honor and dignity versus the life he knew he makes a decision that will change his life forever He goes against everything he learned to do the right thing what his conscience tells him and embarks on a quest for redemption When he becomes a new person the other characters are developed and his relationship with his lover and his companions are delved into The storyline is great a wonderful love story and a great tale 
Nyko responds to so called defects On November 15 Nyko states Nyko is proud to announce that they ve shipped more than 500 000 Intercooler 360s to date helping consumers lengthen the lives of their Xbox 360s so they get more from their investment in next generation hardware The Intercooler 360 creates superior airflow which reduces the console s internal temperatures By maintaining better performance temperature throughout the Xbox 360 system the Intercooler 360 ultimately prolongs the life of the hardware which would otherwise be affected by the intense internal temperatures inside the console Recently a story appeared online claiming that the Intercooler 360 is damaging Xbox 360 consoles Although it looks as if the story came from an isolated incident NYKO takes any such claims seriously It is possible that a defective unit caused damage in the incident however it is impossible to confirm this is the case without inspecting the unit first hand and performing tests on the hardware Any number of reasons from a power spike to using the Xbox 360 without a surge protector could have caused damage Nyko stands by its products 100 and is confident in the Intercooler 360 and its reliability as a safe and effective means of lengthening the life of the Xbox 360 console While a small percentage of all products suffer from defects the total defect rate for the Intercooler 360 is well under 1 which is less than half of the average for consumer electronics products All consumer products will suffer from a small number of defects and Nyko is extremely proud of the low defect rates for the Intercooler 360 For those consumers who feel they have received a defective product Nyko will replace both the damaged Intercooler 360 and Xbox 360 console upon first hand verification that the Intercooler 360 caused the system to fail 
it works sort of In the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well But as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it 
Myths and Facts Introduction I ve had this intercooler since it was released last spring and it has worked well and done its job My 360 is on for at least 3 days at a time with and without a game running Here is the latest update from IGN regarding the Intercooler Here are some facts 1 Scorch Marks This device was a hassle to make sure it was properly and securely plugged in all the way If you move your 360 a lot the cable can losen VERY easily The snap on of the power cord holds the power cord but it doesn t make sure it is plugged in straight or not at a slight angle You can try this out yourself move your power cable around you will see that if you have a habit of moving the 360 around and not recheck the connect in the back it CAN be moved slightly to an angle What would this do It would most certainly cause major power issues You know how the end of the powercord looks like with all the holes that pins on the other end need to connect to you can t afford to not constantly make sure your cord connecting to the Intercooler is nice tight and secure 2 Loud noise I have a lot of old PCs in the house and if I ever do turn them off turning them back on would cause temporary loud noise coming from the fan This is due to dust and the ball bearings either wearing out or starting up with dust in the way Is this a problem No because my Intercooler currently starts up with a louder than usual noise but like my PC fans the noise stops within a seconds to a minute and everything is back to normal 3 How loud is the Intercooler when it is brand new I DON T even notice it My xbox1 makes more noise than the xbox360 + intercooler Moreover when you re playing a game with the volume on you will forget you even have an Intercooler running 4 Stealing power from 360 This is rediculous What do you think the controllers and USB devices are doing when you plug them into the 360 Supplying power Yeah right These tiny fans use less power than plugging in your ipod or whatever usb device and controllers It s true that microsoft has not publicly recommended this product but neither would microsoft allow a product that would damage their expensive consoles It s Microsoft who has to pay for the repairs shipping and replacement of these consoles Microsoft would NOT allow a third party to develop hardware that would break the 360 100 of the time 5 What is this 100 of the time thing I just typed I do know for a fact that there are lots of faulty intercoolers I ve read about lots of exchanges on intercoolers actually my first intercooler never worked It never turned on I took it back on the same day and everything has been fine since If you have a problem with it don t wait or let your Intercooler continue to run Just take it back and get a new one It s onmly 20 bux the thing is made of plastic what do you expect It does however do its job I have never had my 360 lockup overheat or any kind of problems I have an xbox from the second wave shipment in december and it is on ALL THE TIME Recommendations PLEASE don t have your 360 standing up That is just about the dumbest thing Microsoft could have suggested Take a look at your 360 and tell me where the largest and majority of the vents are EXACTLY they are on the bottomside where you would stand your 360 up The Nyko works better if those vents are not blocked It is EXTRACTING air and thus need more air to pass through Even if you don t use an Intercooler please don t stand that thing up I ve read more problems about overheating and disc scratching due to verticle 360 s How does it scratch discs Think about it when it is released from the drive how does the disc stand straight up It is just released and it drops down to the slot that holds the disc and it doesn t hold it in a perfectly level or straight up position that would allow the overly sensitive drive to pick the disc back up at the right angle 
Excellent strategy game There aren t many games now a days that can get me interested enough to play regularly but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does It s a multiplayer multi platform Mac Windows Linux turn based strategy game There is a tun of different strategies to go with many nations magic items spells different units Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person The only drawback is the interface It s certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff I d highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn based strategy It s the best I ve ever played and I ve played quite a few 
Try for yourself Dominions 2 is a fantastic leap into TBS on an Epic scale Huge Gods battling for supremacy by any means possible Genocide reckless magic and disregard for humanity to be the last god of the panthenon A steep learning curve especially for perfectionists it provides you with a simulation of fantasty combat as opposed to actual historical combat Low end graphics are balanced with the fact there are so many of them along with additional abilities A must for those who love 4X and TBS games Not for everyone and documentation that does not do the game justice it is hard to get into but if you can get past the quot I m LOSING and I don t know why quot feeling you will be well worth it 
this is a STRATEGY game I emphasize strategy What you will not find are fancy graphics studio sound arcade action cheats or a killer strategy that will win every time This game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations another in the works 1100 units 400 spells 400 magic sites 250 magic items and much more But the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in YOUR style Berserker defensive researcher swarmer sneak diplomatic whatever Instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn you can actually develop your OWN tactics and surprises There are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try and yes its one of those games which will ACTUALLY survive on your machine for a year 
I have my sources My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It s a MUST HAVE

SWEAT The e Reader is one of the best things that happened to Nintendos GBA this is so SWEA 
A good way to play classic games wherever with few flaws This is great even if you have the NES games For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn t have 2 player mode It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time Still that won t stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them its nothing But the e Reader does more than NES games you may play e Readers from Nintendo Magazines you can play Game Watch games look at Pokemon who cares about that feature connect to games like Super Mario Bros 3 and get power ups as well as new levels and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn t too much of a problem Also e Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals too 
Disney AND Final Fantasy How can one go wrong Anyone who has ever played the original would know that the whole point of kingdom hearts is to beat the stuffing out of the heartless with nifty weapons known as keyblades Well this time around you get to beat the stuffing out of heartless and a new brand of villan known as nobody s With a compelling story line and great voice acting donald and goofy act and sound just like their dsney versions kingdom hearts 2 delivers in every aspect of gameplay except for one the summons I love this game don t get me wrong but i felt that they really could have added a couple of more summons into the mix to make the battle system that much more fun the original had roughly 7 summons all together and this one has only 4 Square how about adding a couple of final fantasy summons into the gameplay cough cough BEHEMUT Either way this is a great game one that any final fantasy or disney fan should pick up 
Just as good as the first If you liked the original then you will also like KH2 It finishes the story nicely Battle commands are improved I especially like the Reaction commands Still has some camera issues Overall a good game 
Great game good diversion If you liked the first KH you will like this one 
Excellent Game So if it s such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating Well it s a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me They physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so But everything else is great about it Graphics are great not excellent but great Sound is great too Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed Kinda on the easy side in normal level though But I guess nothing is perfect Go ahead and get this one It s worth what it costs 
Back to Good The end of the Sands of Time trilogy marks a successful return to the style and fun of Prince of Persia Sands of Time The Two Thrones combines the good fighting mechanics of Warrior Within WW with the downright utter enjoyment that the Sands of Time SoT started two years ago The story picks up where WW left off with the Prince returning home to Babylon Before you know it the sands of time make a comeback and the Prince is left in peril in order to save his kingdom All the great platforming tasks of insane jumps and crazy obstacles are here as are most of the sand powers found in the first two iterations Gameplay is the same for the most part The new speed kill system is quite fun but some may find it eases the fighting difficulty quite a bit That being said its not always the easiest thing to pull off especially when multiple enemies are involved but a cool addition none the less The graphics look better than ever a slight improvement over WW and a remarkable improvement over Sot which was jaw dropping only two years ago The rendered cut scenes look good and the sound is clear including all the voice acting where the original actor from SoT has returned to voice the Prince He does a great job again and really adds to the overall quality of the game The music is a return to the orchestral sounds of eastern decent and the hard rock has left the building to much acclaim This game is very linear which some people may stray away from There is no multiple back tracking like WW However it is enjoyable from start to finish Even the new chariot races are interesting but some may find them slightly out of place There is one Boss fight in particular that will cause many frustrating moments to all After a few times or perhaps dozens studying the patterns and getting your attack down it becomes no problem I did experience one glitch that caused my game to freeze at a certain point several times After searching around on message boards it seems to be a common problem I was able to get past it after resaving over the save point file A word of advice have at least a few different save files along the journey so you don t have to start over at anytime The ending is completely appropriate to the trilogy and leaves you hoping the Prince will one day return This game is a little on the short side At around 7 8 hours for me to complete it seemed shorter than the previous two All in all a great game A must play for anyone who enjoyed the previous two or for fans of third person action adventure You owe it to yourself to play the first two beforehand though if only to see the story from beginning to end and to experience one epic adventure 
The Prince Returns The third installment since the rebirth of the classic series and presumably the final chapter in the Sands of Time saga The Two Thrones takes the best elements of The Sands of Time game one and Warrior Within its sequel and caps the franchise with style finesse and gameplay as sharp as a scimitar blade You once again assume the mantle of the nameless Prince of Persia Returning home to Babylon at long last to find it in ruins and its people at war with an army of sand monsters the Prince also finds himself in the company of old friends and old enemies Cursed he comes to find his body and soul split in two and periodically his wicked self known as the Dark Prince rises forth to wreak havoc and take control of the Prince s body The storyline is entertaining its characters more developed than in most video games and it strikes a nice balance between darkness and light heartedness something Warrior Within failed to achieve In essence it s what you would get if you took the tone and presentation of games one and two and rolled them together As mentioned before the gameplay is not far from that either While The Sands of Time set the tone with its acrobatic platforming which remains pretty much in tact Warrior Within took that game s weak combat mechanics and fleshed them out into something a little more interesting Happily both elements are retained and improved upon in this new installment What s more Tenchu like stealth kills are now available While they re far from perfectly executed sometimes they seem unresponsive they nonetheless offer a fresh twist and the opportunity to avoid hand to hand combat in many circumstances The Dark Prince is another significant addition Regularly throughout the course of the game the Prince transforms into this alter ego a sand monster version of himself that is able to use a weapon called the Daggertail This weapon functions much like the Belmont whip in a Castelvania game allowing the Dark Prince to attack his enemies and also swing from poles and light fixtures to access new areas the Prince couldn t hope to reach While stronger than the Prince in combat unfortunately for the Dark Prince he must sustain himself with a constant supply of sand power or succumb to death when it s all been used up That makes these portions of the game more intense and on rare occasions a little more frustrating Also new to the series are the chariot trials sequences during which the Prince must escape via horse drawn wagons through hazardous environments at full speed ahead While they provide a nice change of pace when they do actually occur they are relatively few and the trial and error nature of them can lead to irritation There are only a few glaring flaws in Thrones The sound effects and ambient music retain their inconsistent buggy feel Too often the dialogue sputters and repeats like a broken record and the music kind of fades in and departs with little rhyme or reason As well the graphics suffer from some pretty blatant clipping problems The engine has aged pretty gracefully but it has aged at least the character designs and architecture go a long way keep you distracted from the occasional failings of the visuals Prince of Persia The Two Thrones is in many respects a very similar game to the two that have come before it Therefore it s not as novel as the first game to longtime followers but it doesn t feel as long in the tooth as it might have at this stage thanks to the new gameplay additions and an entertaining continuation of the story It s certainly a better game than Warrior Within more welcoming in almost every way This series has a lot of life in it and The Two Thrones is well worth your time and effort 
Loads of fun This is my first experience with Sim City I ve never played with the earlier versions Important Note The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case Well I looked and looked and it wasn t where the prompt said it would be After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me I finally found the code It s on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case You ll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual not in the lower left corner The tutorials are helpful so if you re new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first And if you feel you need to go through them again you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over I ll built a small city and I ve only had this game for a day but I know I m going to love it 
This is a GREAT game Computer games have a bad reputation They re violent mindless escapist blah blah blah Mostly that reputation is well deserved computer games are entertainment and as such they re designed to take our minds off of the real world for a while What s wrong with that SimCity 4 is not a typical computer game You need no coordination at all you don t need to accept any fantasy world there s no one to shoot at or anything to shoot with either there are no mazes to run and so on What there is is an ability to see the real world but in a way you WANT it to be rather than as it is In one form or another SimCity has been around for many years This version is part of its continual evolution I ve owned two earlier versions and I found this one to be the best yet in terms of features and operation It works the way its supposed to A side benefit to SimCity is that its long history has allowed a huge on line community to develop There are hundreds of sites offering chat help with issues templates for cities etc You certainly don t need these sites to make full use of the game out of the box but they are there One of the most interesting things about SimCity is the way it demonstrates that education and entertainment aren t mutually exclusive As you play you are forced to come to terms with issues like the relationship between tax rates and business growth parks citizen satisfaction and public works budgets pollution and economic development etc However none of these lessons is explicit they just dawn on you as you play because you see the consequences of your decisions I have heard that very young kids understand and appreciate these issues after a short time playing I tend to measure entertainment value in terms of fun per unit of money In that regard SimCity 4 is an outstanding entertainment value I ve liked the past iterations of the game I like this one even better and I ll almost certainly buy the next version too 
This game was good For those that have have played similar games like Sim City before this one was great I have played Sim City 2000 but that was years ago I had found that game addicting Now years later when I ordered Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition I was blown away This game is much better than 2000 could hope to be They have resolved many of the issues that I had with the older game and then some I have found this game to be addicting to and have started different cities at the same time I am working on getting the perfect city for me to be happy with I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of any of the Sim games I could even say at times it was funny even to read the tongue in cheek sayings that come up just as you are starting up the game for the day like Bureaucratizing Bureaucracies It was not so much hilarious but it can help you get in the fun mode to play the game The advisors can get slightly annoying after awhile especially when you have a different idea about what you want to see in your city than they do but it is still overall a very entertaining game My next purchase will most likely be Sims 2 for more of the Sims experience 
I love it I honestly HATE fighting games I think they re boring and they don t offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by Enter Tekken Tekken has been around for many years When it first came out everyone loved it It used to compete with Virtua Fighter on the Sega Saturn I was impressed then and I m impressed now all these years later The action is just a lot of fun You really couldn t ask for a better fighting game The graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments I love the game and I hope you do as well 
Welcome return to form for an old master Ahh the Tekken series Probably the most influential series of 3D fighting games outside of the Virtua Fighter games Tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre With the 4th game just a distance memory this takes the series forward or back depending on how you look at things Tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted Tekken gameplay while still making everything feel fresh Characters that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones are now fully fleshed out with moves of their own Anna Williams for example is now not a clone of her sister Nina When people mention Tekken they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their mad skillz as it were Making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre This I think is far from the truth Tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike Whereas button bashing pretenders to Tekken s crown coughDeadorAlivecough leave you feeling somewhat cold Tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play Yes Tekken 5 has its button bashing characters but every single character IS unique and how unique they look Arguably the best looking PS2 game to date With gorgeous backdrops fluid realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next gen console Music wise it s back to form mix between techno dance we ve come to know and love from Tekken The least we say about Tekken 4 s music the better You ve got your usual Story mode to run through with each character To see why they ve entered the tournament etc But this 5th edition borrows the human AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4 This has replaced the Arcade mode in name and pits you against humans who have uploaded downloaded their data from the Tekken arcade machine from all over the world It s a welcome challenge even though it doesn t even compare to facing a real life human opponent All in all this is the true homecoming of a master Easily the best Tekken to date and probably the best 3D fighter in existence Though I am partial to abit of Soul Calibur heh 
The best Tekken yet With Tekken 5 the folks at Namco have crafted the best edition yet of the long running fighting franchise Featuring a horde of fighters undoubtadly the best lineup yet Tekken 5 features the same deep gameplay and combo mechanics that will keep you playing for quite some time And because it s Tekken there s a bevy of hidden characters and features to unlock as well There s no Tekken Force mode this time around and instead there is Devil Within a segment that is similar to Tekken Force where you play as Jin Kazama as he battles his way to learn of the devil gene within him It s not much to write home about in itself but there s more features to behold here as well including the addition of playing the arcade versions of Tekken 1 2 and 3 as well as the Namco shooter Starblade The graphics are improved and the backgrounds have been revamped as well all helping make Tekken 5 the best fighter not just for the PS2 but for home consoles in general For veterans to the series and newcomers alike Tekken 5 is a masterpiece and essential to every PS2 owner s library 
I Love this Game In terms of overall quality this game is light years better than Tekken 4 The graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature I especially love the customization feature My only problem is playing against Jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him Other than that this game is terrific 
Demons Rule This is a vary good game one of the best on the PS2 these are my top ten favorite fighters 1 Asuka Kazama 2 Christie Monteior 3 Ling Xiaoyu 4 Kazuya Mishima 5 Jin Kazama 6 King 7 Eddy Gordo 8 Nina Williams 9 Anna Williams 10 Devil Jin The only bad thing is Jinpachi Mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the DevilWithin mini game is ok Arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you ll be playing for hours on end later 
Good but too expensive I have this Monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable about 65 for both and can say that it s the best connection you can find for your old XBOX However I can t really recommend them due to their high prices If you can find the Microsoft HD pack get that as it s much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length 10 feet which can go from one side of my entertainment center where the xbox is to the other side where the stereo receiver is 
Totally sweet One feature that hasn t been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you won t hear any extra noise from EMF Also make sure you check your xbox settings once you ve plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under Display Settings for choosing HD capabilites Make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there isn t that much difference 
Solution for too tight connectors I had similar difficulties with this hi def adapter For one thing the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets And once I did get them on all I got was a black screen But thanks to a friend I figured out what the problem was If you re having trouble getting those Monster cables attached and who hasn t you should get a DeoxIT ProGold Kit by Caig It s just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and more importantly act as a temporary lubricant I got my kit at Radio Shack I think it was about twelve bucks As for not getting any picture at all that was my fault I didn t realize that two of the sets of inputs on my TV are for 1080i only Once I moved the plugs to the proper jacks and turned off the signals that did not apply in my Xbox dashboard the picture was sharp and bright The cables are good quality My only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector It s kind of lame of Monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter Other than that if you ve got the cash get these cables and that Caig kit 
Why not get the best Monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video They cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping Saved 20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days I m happy 
So much fun for the whole family This game is tons of fun My husband children ages 6 and 7 and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game This game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker 
Lots of fun especially with a lot of people It s a pretty fun game It doesn t have a whole lot of songs maybe around 30 40 but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know or would be willing to learn There are also several different modes to play in so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it Perhaps one of the best features is that up to 8 people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers all you need is one controller and the USB headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play I agree with everyone else though when they say the headset is very flimsy I originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal Bad idea You practically have to eat the thing to sing and it IS small and will get caught in long hair Plus you don t get the fun karaoke experience My advice buy the game separately then get the handheld mic As soon as I get some more money I m gonna get the handheld mic myself it picks your voice up better Overall a good buy And lots of fun especially if you have a lot of outgoing un self conscious people 
HARD this game is HARD but very fun so if you want to pick between Fantastic Four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you 
Its what to expect of a do what you want game The game when you first buy it is awsome i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters make people fly 20 yards with your finger and bunt kick a police car down 5 blocks the game lasts a bit because of the smash smash get some cash gameplay the more smash points you get the more moves you get the moves are the best part at one point in the game you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street its alot better then skateboarding on a bus if you ask me anyway once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers it gets extremely repetitive at the end of the game when you get critical alert status the same guys always come 5 5 stars for the first 3 weeks 2 months 4 the next month and basically declining to 3 BUT whenever you are board and have nothin to do no good tv is on all of your friends are offline and every other game is getting booring its nice to take a good ol trip back to this game and smash a mech or to you know for old times sake 
ultimate awesomel i would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra 
Ultimate Fun Great tutorial and hands on learning This game is action packed with fight moves jumps combos etc My only complaint was Hulk s reaction time during running But that s easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff A definate buy 
Hulk Smash Plot Lines I love a good intricate storyline in a game as much as the next person The RPG known for it s generally intricate plotline is one of my favorite genres And to The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction s credit it does contain a story penned by a seasoned comicbook author And again to the game s credit the story really isn t too bad fairly generic but servicable The script is voiced adequatly and presented in a way that doesn t deter from the real focus of the game Rampant wanton gratuitous destruction in some of the most creative ways possible I love The Hulk as a character I even liked the Ang Lee flick no hate mail please myfriends give me enough crap for that one as it is There s something cathartic about a nearly indestructable creature that operates on pure Id Who doesn t want to just lose it when we get pushed too far This game has many things going for it it controls very well nearly every object in the vast and varied environments is destructable in some way shape or form and the graphics are certainly servicable although not top notch The best way to describe this is to take an open gamespace like the Grand Theft Auto games minus the infuriatingly difficult missions and add a set of missions that beg you to destroy everything Every mission is based in some way on the premise of you as a giant green demolition expert Now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly but the game does remain fresh do in large part to a huge selection of upgraded moves that you can buy with smashpoints which are awarded via smashing things deep huh It is really a massive orgy of soothing mayhem and mercy is it ever satisfying If you tried out the first Hulk game please be aware that this is NOTHING like that There are no more tedious sneaking missions as Bruce Banner YOU ARE THE HULK and the Jade Giant is an absolute gas in this title Like the GTA games you are not forced into playing missions although this does unlock new moves and arenas to play in You can take on side quests which are not only pretty creative but downright hilarious in others try batter up for an example of the latter If the first Hulk game and Ang Lee s movie left a sour taste in your mouth when it comes to Mr Green Genes then give this one a shot In my opinion they got the essence of the Hulk down pat and show him for the fun character that he can be Later 
The end has come is that a good thing Note This review is spoiler free with regards to the game s story All good things must eventually come to an end such as the star wars series the lord of the rings trilogy and the Jak and Daxter trilogy not including the racing game and Daxter s own PSP game After two excellent games our favorite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the Jak trilogy The big question is Is it a good ending I m pleased to say that overall yes Jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of Jak 2 Haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots metal heads and other nasties The population blames Jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help Abandoned by those he saved Jak and his buddy Daxter set out on thier final adventure Like it s two predecessors Jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter You get various jumps kicks punches and leaps and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy Kung Fu and karate aren t enough Jak s moves remain largely unchanged from Jak 2 which will now be called J2 He can still punch like a man jump like a kangaroo and leap like a bullfrog Gunplay remains pretty much the same as well You get four guns blaster rifle machine gun and peacemaker but in a nice twist each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on The rifle for example starts out in it s default setting Hower the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions Each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast The peace maker for example can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around whee while it s final upgrade well let s just say that you ll be shooting mini nukes a lot The biggest change to Jak s game play comes in the form of vehicles While J2 had flying vehicles and zoomers Jak 3 has cars and not the nice talking Pixar kind Because half the game is set in the desert Jak and Daxter get around on dune buggies There are eight of them and each has various unique traits Some are really really fast one can jump riddiculously high wheee and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick boo You ll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part it s enjoyable and fun though some of them such as the sand shark can be a bit difficult to handle Another new feature of Jak 3 is the sheer size of it J1 and J2 had two enormous areas to run around in Here you have not one not two but three yes three gigantic areas to run around in And like the previous games there are no loading times an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds Spargus city the wasteland and Haven city are You ll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout Jak 3 s world such as how Haven city has ahem changed since the last game Dark Jak powers return as well but are now balanced by a new side to our hero light Jak If Dark Jak is the attacking force Light Jak is the defensive force Dark allows you to kill things really quickly while Light allows you to heal fly this is so AWESOME surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield and even slow down time to a crawl Both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters And in a very nice touch you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it While both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during gameplay both are really just a little added bonus to spice up gameplay when you want to as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force except for scripted moments where you need to But then again being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing smile Like J2 Jak 3 has you going from place to place talking to people and doing what they tell you to do And when you finish with that you head over to the next person and do what they want to do etc It s a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive but it does have one big strength You don t have to start the next mission until you want to If you want you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times and then tackle the mission This free roaming system allows you to do what you d like to do if you don t feel like doing missions for a while One thing i d like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level If one takes a look at my review for J2 one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards Naughty dog for making J2 the most unnecessarily hardest game i ve ever played and it still is by the way tied only with Spider man for PS2 I am very pleased that Naughty Dog towned down the difficulty a lot for Jak 3 No longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the TV while screaming obscenities becuase that a hole Errol won that fricken race again Here the difficulty seems just right Not too hard not too easy Most missions require a few attempts before they are completed and a few can be finished on one try There are still a few that are quite difficult and one or two that are grit your teeth inducing but overall nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series Oh and there are only a few go through the ring missions this time around Thank goodness In addition to the free roaming gameplay there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest There are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in Jak 3 and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light Jak power invincibility extra vehicles various weapon upgrades etc While some are hidden behind corners many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way such as searching around a paticular area going through rings grumbles following a little blue light and even stopping time There are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs but the results are well worth it In addition Jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of wow factor Fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine Even with all these fine points Jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game the story J2 is most memorable to me for it s story It had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next The story in Jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next but ultimitly it left me unsatisfied How so The three biggest ones are charachters the precursers and the ending And for those of you worrying that i m going to tell you who the precursers are which I won t i m going to keep this as spoiler free as I can First off the charachters We have Jak and Daxter of course and those two are always fun to watch and care about We have many returning charachters such as Torn Sig and Samos and we have some new residents from Spargus city The problem Almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development It s assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that Jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do That may be okay but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all Torn is still gruff and tough but not as much as last time Ashelin is the firm leader and Samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly Keira who was such a vital charachter in J1 and J2 has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important Sig well he s just there because he s cool The only returning charachter who kept me interested was Tess who fufills the dumb blonde role Her relationship with Daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily Errol returns as well though I won t say how but he s gone from insanely irritating to average irritating a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in J2 Of the new charachters only one Damos kept my interest due to his charachter Tough yet gentle and caring at the same time he s easily the most compelling of Jak s new companions The new villian count Veger isn t that compelling though he does have some very powerful scenes especially one near the ending One of the claims on the back of the game box is that we ll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are As I said earlier I won t reveal who the precursers are someone did that and ruined the suprise for me except that in my personal opinion we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery I personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now It s like revealing the face of doctor claw When you go back and experience your old memories there is no more mystery or wonder anymore In my personal opinion these beings should have remained hidden forever However the saddest part of the game for me is the ending Again I won t ruin it for you but it s always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes Some people criticise the ending of the film Return of the King saying that it goes on too long However the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it s time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied However Jak 3 doesn t do that As the game goes on and gets closer to the end the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes and sadly the battle itself isn t that exciting or memorable The ending does end the trilogy but leaves the door wide open for more games of which two have already happened I ve invested a lot of time on these three games i ve grown attatched to it s charachters and I would like closure to all thier stories Saldy that doesn t happen Everything is left wide open when in my opinion it should have been closed There is no real ending here at least one that ties everything up nicely But despite my points with the story I do want to stress that Jak 3 is a very good game It s a satisfying blend of storytelling platforming shooting driving and action It s one of those games where you keep saying Just five more minutes just five more minutes only to discover that time has flown by and it s two in the morning It s addictive fun and for me a blast to play I definitly recommend it especially if you find it for under twenty dollars 
Why do they only let u go up to 5 stars 5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is Light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NON STOP ACTION GAME 
Nice finish up to the trilogy INTRO Jak 3 is the ending to the Jak and Daxter trilogy and I have to say that it pulled it off quite nicely There are a few flaws in the game but nothing major You start out as Jak now an exile from Haven City because of people who distrust him and his dark powers He is taken in by the people of the Wasteland and the story continues from there GAMEPLAY Once again Jak moves very fluidly and nicely and has the exact same controls as the last game except for certain new powers like Light Jak And once again the animators have done a wonderful job of making lush detailed landscape and characters Sunsets and sunrises are done well and nothing looks cut and pasted on to the walls like Spyro era games I like the way that in this game you get to move between Haven City and the Wasteland This way you get even more terrain to explore than in the last game Additionally you get control of Light Jak powers I thought this was a nice twist and a nice way to add in something new for the people who enjoyed the Dark Jak option One thing that personally irks me they took away Keira s voice actor She barely speaks and when she does it s not the same person At least the other Keira had a role also the ending felt a little dragged out and towards the end of the game I was just hoping that it would finish soon instead of prolonging it with more crammed in missions PROS CONS Pros 1 Nice characters 2 No glitches so far 3 No loading times 4 Detailed landscape 5 New powers and old Dark Jak and Light Jak 6 Good switches between areas Cons 1 Blasting people or monsters over and over can get annoying 2 The ending seemed to go at the pace of a SNAIL OVERALL A nice finish to the series If you bought the first two you ll most definitely be drawn to this one anyway 
My brothers opinion This was a present for my brother so I don t know what it was like but he said it is the best 3rd person game on the x box 
AWESOME GAME This game has outstanding graphics and great 3 D gameplay plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action To add to the few you can play in the Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War the bad thing though is that in the Clone Wars the main battles are on Naboo to be honest the Clone Wars started on Geonosis and are in Episode II not I I love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons and you can also play as the wookies clones droids rebels and Imperials If you are a beginner video game player or new to Star Wars when you choose CREATE FILE try using easy This game follows the movies really well and you can explore Mos Eisley or maybe Naboo if you like The more battles you win the bonuses you get If you read the Instruction Booklet it says if you go on a Killing Spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus I Highly Recommend this game to all Star Wars fans The game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time So if you want a good long lasting game try this I really hope Star Wars fans will love the game Multi Player mode is great and I really enjoy playing it This game is great and I love it Try playing it for yourself I am about to wrap this review up so listen THAT THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR THE XBOX AND HAS TERRIFIC GAMEPLAY AND FEATURES THAT YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY IT ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLINE OR SINGLE PLAYER YOU CAN STILL HAVE FUN AND KNOW IT IS ALL OUT STAR WARS ACTION THIS GAME IS GREAT AND I JUST LOVE PLAYING IT I know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three I enjoy playing this BUY IT NOW P S BUY EVERY THING STAR WARS 
Great game and concept I ll admit that being able to go around as a stormtrooper and kill everything in sight is fun Wicked fun This game delivers if you want to have a good time playing a FPS involving Star Wars The major drawback to the game is the targetting It s like using a sniper rifle in Halo 1 but the reticle is the size the one for the assault rifle You can turn on the auto aim option to help with accuracy but then the reticle tends to follow an enemy on screen and it s more difficult to shoot over an ally s shoulder Another drawback is that you can t jump fall and shoot at the same time like in other FPSs Plus fighters are hard to learn how to use as are other vehicles You can still do fine as a footsoldier but it would be nice if the vehicles were a little easier to use 
Finially a wireless controller without lag This is the first wireless controller that I have ever used that didn t LAG constantly In fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low The range is more than enough for any room in my home Actually I have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows Great product that I now have two of them and have retired the wired controller 
best controller this is one of the best controller I ever have grip felling and handeled are good as experience I recomende 
Great Purchase Bought this as a gift for my granson It is awesome Many games to pick from and the ease of use is great He s only five and works the buttons with ease Plus you can take it anywhere Great price here too Cheaper than anyone else 
If you like Star Wars buy this game If you dont like Star Wars buy this game Seriously though this game is awesome I bought this game simply because I had heard it was good and I am glad I did The plot is great actually worthy to bear the star wars name The story is what makes this game great and the ending is satisfying It has everything tons of action and fighting emotional dialogue lots of choices and even a few occasional hints of romance The basic story is this and don t worry I wont tell you too much You are a soldier for the republic that gets involved in the rescue of a Jedi who you develop a kind of mysterious bond with Through out the game you travel to several planets including Tatooine Kashyyyk Dantooine and several new ones never mentioned in the original movies 
one of the best I recived KOTOR for christmas I was skeptical the front picture was strange to me I popped it in installed and started playing Three weeks later I was completely into it It is one of the funnest games that I have ever played The missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars RPG ranking up there with World of Warcraft and other hyper popular RPGs 
Very good It s a very good product but it only can be shipped within U S so I can t buy i 
its a must you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub 
A little old school with a little new Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES with the first Mario RPG Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars a game I absolutely love and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator The reason is the general gameplay for this RPG hasn t changed You move around different screens attack the enemies fight bosses etc There is definately a unique and I suppose you might consider it simplistic ideology that this game follows It s an easier version of action RPGs you level up battles aren t random you can see the enemies you engage on screen though it is turn based This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it it s own game I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn t mind a lot of chatting but even more action and puzzles Another homerun for Mario RPGs 
Good times with old friends I love this game Once I started playing I couldn t stop My DS battery is dead after like 3 days I play so much Once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing You get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time The controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into So lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there Mario greatness 
Great game for a 5 year old Spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played It was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating There are alot of Xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old This game was not meant for an adult gaming audience I was surprised when I realized this game is no longer in production There should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket My son loves this game He literally wore it out I have to find him another copy of Hero s Tail to replace his old one 
Really cool gam You get to be different animals It is a really cool game I recommend it to other kids to buy The cheetah get shoot bow and arrows 
Improvements to Spyro I got this for X mas and I am a huge Spyro fan I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games and the second on Playstation 2 The last one Enter the Dragonfly wasn t SO successful and I feared there wouldn t be another but here it is And SO many things have been added Buying items at item shops keychains for keys to open boxes riding around in the professors new gadget ball mini games featuring not Spyro but his friends etc i kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race but This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don t have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole etc as he moves along and he even meets little dragons like him Ember Flame Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge but it never seems overwhelming Some of the mini game s second levels are a pain but you can come back later The strategy guide is also helpful This time I don t think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn t evolved or that it s the same old thing but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels He s Spyro Hours of enjoyment 
Good workout but camera issues I wanted this workout game to get back into shape after having a baby It is a great workout including cardio combat isolation for abs arms or legs and mind and body including yoga and tai chi type exercises I love that it tells you what day to work out and if you don t you fail that day and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive A which is hard to achieve and it should be I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year I love that Nike helped produce the game I recommend this game to anyone however I have issues with the eyetoy camera You would think I would get how the camera works after 8 weeks but I still have problems Sometimes it indicates that I touched something I was nowhere near and sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries for it to register that I touched something You re still getting the workout but I m working towards getting a good letter grade I want credit for what I m doing right The combat exercises are frustrating as I have a hard time believing I m not punching hard enough and often receive a 0 score I ve started working out at night as the sunlight from the windows makes the camera less responsive There have been a couple of times that I ve walked to the left of the screen and my body triggered the try again button after a cardio workout so I had to do the 10 minute workout again as history has shown when I try to exit out of it the game fails me for the day for quitting All in all I m happy with the workouts but just know that the camera takes some getting used to I hope others have better luck with it than I have My husband does the 12 week program also and he s lost 10 pounds and I ve lost 9 
Phenomenal Product Wow that s all I can say All the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this game Just got it a few days ago and am SO IMPRESSED with all that s packed into it It also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises This is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen People of all fitness levels can enjoy this This technology interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts has got to be the wave of the future 
Total body work out without the high monthly fees of a gym Got this for Christmas and absolutely love it It works for everyone on any work out level even for beginners There are two types of work out 1 Routine Builder basically you are on your own you get to pick exercises you are interested in 2 Personal Trainer basically you follow a 12 week program It tracks your progress it tells you when it is your rest day to avoid over exhaustion it has a guide advice on proper posture breathing and technique It has a good amount of stretching exercises in the beginning and end of each sessions It even enhances balance of mind and body very much like yoga It also combines fluid movements like Tai Chi rhythmic dance moves and kick boxing moves Needless to say I love this game If you re looking for a good sweat without the high fees of the gym this is the game for you 
Excellent software I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it The software is very well done and it really does have real time feedback If I m leaning forward when I m not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say try standing up straight I am definitely getting a great work out 10 more weeks and I ll let you know if it did any good or not So far it seems to be helping I love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense The one drawback is the camera is really sensitive I have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score If you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer Kinetic seems to be the way to go 
Good with one major flaw This game is really good but i don t think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long So if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game 
Fun game don t have all the time in the world I love this game for what it is You cannot expect this to be anything like Madden but it is still a fun game Injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced Fast Paced something I cannot say about the loading This game is the slowest loading game I have ever played It actually took three minutes for it to load one time Get this game provided that you can wait a little bit 
Good Football Game This is an unorthodox football game This is not an NFL game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league There are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom Beat the Division 3 level move up to 2 Beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game As you move up you also unlock rewards If you re tired of Madden s franchise mode give this game a try It won t get outdated just because of NFL free agency 
Blitz the League LOAD TIME be prepaired to wait Other then that it s a fun game that keeps you playing 
The Dark Side Of Football For Anyone Who Loves Football And Everything About It Knows Their Is Also A Dark Side Of The Game Where Players Take Illegal Drugs To Help Out Their Game Where Owners Will Do Anything For Their Team To Win This Game Is Alot Like Any Given Sunday Remember Win At Any Cos 
Double Dash Is Fast and Fun I love this game it is so much fun Even though my wife does not like it I recommend this game for anyone who like Mario Kart games Enjoy the races and don t forget to blow your friends up 
good i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin 
Amazing I know I m a little late but what the heck I felt like writing a review for this game Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game Simple as that Its extremely deep has a fantastic story great characters great battle system and it s the perfect length for a RPG 45 55 hours Not everyone likes Tidus be he honestly doesn t bother me and I think he is a interesting character The rest of the cast is well developed and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe The cast is very memorable you ll remember them for years to come and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for so that doesn t disapoint The gameplay is extremely fun and its actually one of my favorite battle systems The battle system can make or break a RPG and this one doesn t disappoint Its fast paced so it doesn t get bogged down by long battles You can also swap characters mid battle thats a awesome feature The gameplay is also incredibly deep I ve heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game So if thats your thing I m sure you ve probably already played this game If for some reason you have not played this game and your into RPG s don t hesitate to pick this game up its cheap now and its one of the best and most balanced RPG s I ve ever played 
A New Standard in Console RPGs Without a Doubt FFX is one of the best if not the best rpgs to come out on any of the current consoles It features an incredible and orignal story populated with interesting and varied characters Additionally the sphere gird system allows the player to develop character abilites in an interesting and innovative manner Admittedly the sphere grid system complexilty may scare away rpg newbies but with a little time will become second nature to players of all skill levels Featuring a wonderful score even by Final Fantasy standards and impressive graphics for the PS2 there is little reason for any video game fan not to pick up this title even with the ever present advent of FF 12 on the horizon 
Beautiful Graphics And Deep Gameplay There is so much to see and discover in this game It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena Someone who wanted to complete all side quests find all special items etc could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored just incredibly deep gameplay The graphics are also outstanding among the best I have seen in a video game It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters stats At first I didn t find it as satisfying as the typical method of leveling up But eventually I began to enjoy it and it s now one of my favorite aspects of the game The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were The storyline itself was quite good But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game Definitely worth buying 
Absolutely Awesome game I have to say this is a game that was worth every dollar spent It s a game that I will keep for life and probably play again someday I don t know what the previous Final Fantasy games were like so for me there is no comparison I think I m totally biased toward Final Fantasy X The two coolest aspects about this game for me are the Aeons and Blitzball The other thing I like about this game is the storyline the characters and the beautiful scenary I forgot to mention how great the music is also I ve been reading reviews about current and previous Final Fantasy games and the thing that is still missing for me is the Aeons and Blitzball I m also attached to the characters in Final Fantasy X Even the sequel doesn t cut it for me right now For me it s Final Fantasy X all the way 
What a game I have been a fan of this game ever since playing against my buddy on my vacation in Colorado last year Whether you re interested in pure speed and competative racing or taking your opponents out in road rage it s all FUN In addition you can just cause unbelievable mayhem with crash mode where the whole object is to cause as much destruction as possible This game lasts a LONG time so you have a lot to do it never gets boring I mean there are like 50 cars and trucks waiting for you if you can win them 
Crash Bang Boom Yeah it s all there For all of you out there who love destruction Who love seeking sweet revenge on someone who knocks you out of a lap or tosses your sorry butt into the drink this is the game for you One of the basic foundations of this game is destruction Even when you re knocked around beaten down crushed humiliated and etc you gain points with the craziness of your crash There are a few different race modes Some of which can get a little tedious but it s all well worth it It s a bit challenging sometimes it seems like there is no way you ll be able to make that time limit or create enough damage but as you play you will find the way It s extremely easy to sit down with the controller in your hand and look up at the clock four hours down the road It s a very addictive game but is great fun I would recommend this game to anyone who is a racing fan Without a question a 5 star game 
Best racing game I ve ever played This is the fastest and funnest racing game we ve ever played It may not have simulated vehicles by specific manufacturers as in Gran Turismo but that doesn t matter here because the fun comes in the super fast racing and battling As the name Takedown implies a lot of this game is about taking your opponents out forcing them off the road into other cars etc The crashes in the game are well simulated So much so that there s a Crash Mode where all you do is see how much damage your car can cause by crashing into other vehicles Very fun game with high replay value P S If you are into cheat codes there don t seem to be any for this game You have to win the different challenges to unlock vehicles events and locations 
Worth the wait Much has been said about the technical aspects or systems requirements of the game as have many reviews for Oblivion and other next gen or advanced games on the market today Caesar III was quite old the sequel was always going to be further along with the system demands It was worth the wait Let s talk about the game The basic gameplay is intuitive Not a lot you haven t done before The interface is pretty standard and can be minimized off the screen for screenshots or just zooming around without distraction Which you really should do As with all these types of games you can spend a lot of time building and developing You need to get a cup of tea and sit back with this one for the closeup views of the city at work and at play is what is so new here The graphics look somewhat standard on a zoom out top down view There is a lot that looks familiar Until you start to get a closer look and the texture details come to life and you realize there is another level of realism here as you watch the shadows lengthen along the plaza near the sparkling fountain as the midday sun moves across the sky and the trees sway in the breeze Wow No other Roman game out currently comes close This has everything you always wanted with Caesar III and had somewhat with CoTN Children of the Nile although the buildings here are more substantial and better realized The CoTN feature of being able to follow behind a person as they move on the streets saving you the hassle of trying to maneuver the camera views to get a realistic walkthru experience is one that they should have implemented here I would have liked to see more variety in the housing also in the goods particulary food There are only three foods grain vegetables and meat cattle No figs cheeses fruits pork chicken or fish The production lines are very simplified with no bakeries for bread and no weavers for cloth The grain goes to the households and the wool straight to clothing or armor factories More decorative options should have been available as well Overall while the quality of what exists is very good there is certainly room for an expansion I hope that they do address these things in games to come It s part of the appeal and adds to the longevity and continued interest in the game The maps are overall somewhat small although a game this graphic intensive would have to reasonably limit the size to facilitate performance There are very limited sandbox modes available at least for now and I can find no user created scenarios currently available due in part to the complexity of the unsupported editor But again what there is is very good indeed All of the structures are beautifully done with attention to detail The landscape can be breathtaking with a variety of ways to put your city together around the terrain And enough hustle and bustle on the city streets to bring it to life And did I mention that you can zoom all the way down INTO an arena or colliseum watch closeups of the games or swivel around from the floor of the arena and watch all the spectators coming in and out and moving around or cheering I am currently running a mid line gaming system with a NVidia 6800 a system that can run Oblivion fairly well I had to update some drivers as well as defragment my hard drive to run this game smoothly I hadn t experienced many lags until I had built up a larger city or had been playing for several hours and my system started to protest I replaced the game launcher icon installed by the game to the Desktop or Program Files with a shortcut I created from the game file Caesar exe to actually get the game to start something I found from the forums was a consistent problem There are some bugs with the trade routes Opening them before you have goods doesn t seem to be the problem as much as setting the ports to sell goods you will sell but don t have in stock yet I m not thrilled with the number of people it takes to man each prefect but it usually seems to work well enough except on high speeds where the frequency of fires seems to increase but if you have more than two or three buildings burning you are better off destroying those and rebuilding than waiting for them to get put out You can easily find your entire city in flames very quickly While it certainly has a few faults most things are a matter of preference and having an adequate clean system The core game itself is fundamentally solid It takes work to build up economic stability based on trade and taxes and how well you handle your production chains You can create with any scenario stable cities that will largely run themselves aside from the requests demands from the Empire Your ratings screen will tell you things you need to do to meet your goals For instance Prosperity would also mean higher levels of housing especially villas as well as successful taxation and trade Better educational coverage not only affects the Culture rating it affects the Security rating because better education means less crime as will having good coverage for Jupiter who will frequently remove all criminals as his blessing Good religious coverage will affect both your Prosperity and Culture ratings as you then evolve your housing The military will automatically meet a threat to the city and doesn t require a lot of micromanagement as long as you have everything in place and well supplied With the stable gameplay depth realistic economic simulation great music and breathtaking graphics it s not only a very good game but the best of the current selection of city builders So if you have to chose I would recommend this one first Enjoy 
FUN I LUV THIS GAME IT IS SO MUCH FUUUUUUUUUUN I HATE YOU PPL WHO SAY IT IS STUPID I THINK YOU ARE STUPID BUY IT 
Best Handheld by Far The ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today The black color is a really nice option too I think it looks much more elegant The only complaint I can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black 
Great system in the handheld or console market If I had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors I d choose the DS Now I m glad I have the option i e money to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where I could only take one system well you get the idea In a way the DS reminds me of the PS2 It s a bargain It s backwards compatible so it plays GBA game The games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 You can t go wrong 
An Innovative Gaming System About a month ago I decided to purchase my first game system since the origional NES I got the DS and I must say I love it Somehow they have found an idea that seemed to only be a gimmick the dual screens and turn it into something new and fun So far I have bought New Super Mario Brothers Mario 64 DS Metroid Prime Hunters Mario Kart and a Japan English dictionary program my main justification for buying it in the first place It is a great way to kill 5 min or kill a few hours Once you get used to using the stylus it becomes very natural Pros Fun games for all skill levels Nice styling Wireless connectivity Multiple people can play the same game off of one card Bright screen with good graphics nice sound long battery life Cons It fits a little awkwardly in my hands You must buy a screen protector the stylus can scratch up the lower screen pretty badly In some games the stylus blocks your view of different sections of the screen The Onyx Black looks cool but it gets extremely smudged up with finger prints Overall The cons are nothing compared with the pros I highly recommend it 
Railroad Tycoon Sequel This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon If you loved the old 1990 s original you ll enjoy this one as well Only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited 
Great remake of the original Railroad Tycoon I ve never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game A number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in Railroads as compared to RRT3 which is absolutely correct If you are seeking a complex simulation Railroads is not the game for you If however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then I wholeheartedly recommend Railroads It is one of my favorite games of all time 
XBOX WIRELESS MINI VALUE PAK INTEC THE BEST SET OF WIRELESS CONTROLLERS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY XBOX SYSTEM THE CONTROLLERS ARE NICELY FITTED FOR COMFORTABLE USE AND DOES NOT CRAMP UP YOUR HANDS AFTER HOURS OF PLAY CONNECTS GREAT AND NO INTERRUPTIONS WHILE GAME PLAYING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE THAT IS LOOKING TO BUY CONTROLLERS OUT THERE THEY ARE AWESOME LOOKING GREAT FOR PLAYING HALO 2 I USE IT ALOT WITH THIS GAME AND IT IS THE BOMB PLUS MY RANKING HAS GONE UP SINCE USING IT WHILE PLAYING ON XBOX LIVE 
This game is a major high I think it s a great game and you can play online with other people around the world It s good your re able to play online because after awhile the easy level gets to be boring There are different levels to keep your intrest The campains are really awsom They never become boreing The Mythology in it is real This game is a real high easily gets addictive Days of fun 
WHY IS IT A GOOD GAME There are alot of reasons so you dumb people that rtae it low probably never played it heres why i think its great WHY ITS GREAT fun in editor to just mess around no need to test map to have people fight many units that can make diffrent stratadgies god powers are great many mythical units that make the game unique the Titans are crazzzzy you beat the campaign well download the new free one online go to the main website of AOM =D =D =D beat every campagin that exsists You can still play online make many skirmish wars and even make your own campaigns many fun maps can be easy or hard depending what difficulty s you choose so its great for everyone new armies gods powers all that good stuff = So basically this games greta buy it actually better yet buy the gold edition which has this expansion and the original which you need to use the expansion HAVE FUN 
Age of Mythology is Awesome My son is enthralled with this game He is learning while being entertained The graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC What more could we ask for 
Perfect For All Your Gamesaves The Memory Card 1019 from Nintendo is excellent for saving Gamecube saves I used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games And some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them I tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted I have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing I have saved has become corrupted Even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like The Sims 2 I still have more than enough space left The price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already 
No Fighting No Weapons System Good for Girls I bought this game used and wish that I could find a dozen more like it I do not like video game violence I don t want to kill people But I love the whole exploring a world figuring out puzzles angle This game was perfect for that It had attractive graphics an interesting premise and good challenges On the downside it doesn t really call out to be replayed once you get through it once Which is why it s better to buy it used and why I wish they d make a sequel 
If you like movies If you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game It is as if you are the star of the film But that also means that there are many cut scenes These cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic But there are those of you out there that don t liek cut scenes at all If this is the case for you reader don t buy this game If you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you can t go wrong with this game I have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price It is that good if you like cut scenes 
Time travel RPG This was a good game that keeps you thinking The story line is that something terrible has happened and you end up being able to go back in time to change events and therefore change the outcome You get to go back to different era s such as the horse and buggy era and back to modern day There are several endings as well depending on what you ve done You end up playing it through several times to experience the different endings The plot of the story is good and the game has a good pace because time is an issue So you feel like you got to stay on your toes 
One of those must have games The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant With 2 you are now in the 1960s with hippies and KBG agents all around you If you didn t play the original Destroy All Humans games it involved grey big eyed aliens coming down to earth in the 1950s You ran around reading their thoughts taking over their minds and slaying them Half of the fun was the incredibly funny sense of humor in the game as you interacted with these humans of the 50s With Destroy All Humans 2 we jump forward to the 1960s The President of the US JFK was apparently a female loving space alien The KBG realize this and try to help out The next thing you know the aliens are on attack again and you re in charge You run around city maps watching as hippy chicks shout out Back off Pig and reading their minds You can mentally throw objects take over bodies and much more This game is much more active than other adventure games you have to hammer on buttons to get actions to occur You can t just passively press one button and be all set The graphics are great You really get immersed into the world of the 60s with the appropriate cars the hippy vans the murals painted on walls The outfits people wear are super There are the traditional items to collect objectives to achieve and people to slay But again most of the fun is in what you hear along the way The commentary is hilarious The thoughts you overhear can get you laughing out loud If humans happy to see you doing something alieny you can zap them with free love and the daisies dancing in their brain along with the hippy music will soon distract them from any troublesome thoughts of grey aliens Even better if you have a friend come and visit you can do co op play Now there are a few anachronisms didn t Love the One you re With come out in 1970 Or maybe they re saying Stephen Stills got his inspiration from a hippy dude named The Freak In any case I m sure Destroy All Humans 3 will be set in the 70s so we ll get enough of that soon enough In the meantime be sure to get your hands on this version and help bring peace to the world 
more Castlevania Another Castlevania game means more excitement Going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of Castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years I love the graphics They are truly something magnificent The special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch Just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a Castlevania game should be This game follows the formula that was featured in Symphony of the Night which means if you like the Metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well 
arguably the best shooter ever made I recently picked this game up because the laptop I had purchased for college was finally a computer powerful enough to run it It is easily one of the best computer games I ve ever played The playing world is massive you can literally walk to any mountain or monument you see in the distance and there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal and or solve a mission The basic plot is this you are Jack Carver who has accompanied a woman to a part of Micronesia for undisclosed reasons she turns out to be a CIA agent and before long she is kidnapped and you are fighting for your life against an army of well trained mercenaries It s a fairly generic shooter plot but it gets the point across and ties everything together well The enemy AI is unbelievably good The soldiers work together to take you down all the while dropping hilariously bad one liners like HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE APPLES RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES MOFO I M GONNA TEAR YOU A NEW ONE The shootouts that result in this game are a blast you really have to get good cover and strategize your fight It s the first shooter I ve played that makes me feel like I m actually in an action movie The vehicles are one of the game s biggest highlights If you want to move quicker downstream you can snipe at occupants of the frequent patrol boats on the water and steal their ride You can often obtain RVs and ATVs and at one point in the game a forklift for reasons unknown These are a blast as you can drive right through the enemies firing at you One thing I enjoy doing is driving full speed at an enemy and bailing out at the last second Always good fun The game is also a great challenge I just completed the game on the Medium setting and it was still almost impossible in places Fighting the trigens the small monkey like creatures with claws is a nightmare on any diffculty as they can outrun and outJUMP you and kill you with often a single hit I strongly suggest using the sniper rifle or a powerful machine gun other than the M4 on them at long distance before they really mess you up In short this is the best FPS I have ever played and probably one of the best computer games ever made overall Highly recommended on a side note not that it matters to me but I m personally surprised this game got a Mature rating there is barely any blood at all and none of it sticks on the floor And when shot with a rocket launcher people don t explode like normally in Mature rated shooters This game SHOULD have been rated TEEN 
Far Cry Video Game This game I purchased for my sons They both told me they enjoyed this game A little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges If you want a game that is not too easy this is the one Have fun and don t let losing take the fun away It is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills 
Brilliant intense gameplay and graphics make up for slightly lacking story After finishing both Half Life Episode I and The Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay over a few days I was looking for another fun first person shooter game that would let me pass away an hour or so a day and allow me to unwind by slaughtering a constant flow of enemies with high powered weapons without resulting in the actual murder of innocent people I d heard that Far Cry was pretty good so I bought it installed it and got ready to blast The first thing I noticed is the astonishing graphics engine It s without a doubt the most beautiful environment ever created for an FPS My jaw was on the floor for the first few hours checking out the ridiculously high detailed environment The outdoor scenery looks like a paradise holiday destination with crystal clear blue water and lush green jungle There is birdlife fish and a general feeling that you re running around a living breathing world One thing was very different right from the start and would play a major role in later missions There is no save game option There are checkpoints littered around the levels but it can occasionally be around 10 to 20 minutes of solid game play between them At first this just annoyed me since I found myself reloading over and over on some of the harder missions I couldn t just run into the fray firing my weapon left right and centre at anything that moves because one headshot would send me back a heck of a long way in some instances I was forced to change my style of play from all out assault to a stealthy crawling breath holding sweating nerve wracking approach I rediscovered the part of myself that loved Thief The Dark Project so very much all those years ago Yet I still got to combine that approach with levels of general carnage when it was simply unavoidable I am now a firm believer that the save game option should be removed from many other not all first person games out there as it raises the intensity level dramatically The story itself is fairly average and the dialogue even more so which is really what places Far Cry below the likes of Half Life You are basically just following instructions the entire game used as a violent killing machine with no real choices But for some reason I just didn t care as I was so absorbed by the surroundings and simply surviving that it didn t lower my enjoyment The enemies have very good AI flanking me whenever possible and generally actually trying to avoid being shot rather than running straight at me There are plenty of occasions though where an enemy will just stand there in the distance while you shoot them from plain sight but generally all is good The weapons are fantastic being both highly effective and satisfying to use The sniper rifle as always is a personal favourite and this game makes awesome use of it with massive maps of open ground While initially I was prepared for a standard Serious Sam type of game Far Cry turned out to be so much more Some fantastic graphics inspired level design forced variations of play and some fiercely intense gunfights make this game an absolute winner You can add value for money as well since there are 20 long missions to get through With no save option those 20 will take you a long time to complete But you will love it I sure did 
Unbelievable game I agree with nearly everyone s reviews so I wont go over it again but The physics of the game is incredible I shot an ogre on top of a hill and the dead body rolled ALL THE WAY to the bottom of the hill Some advice pay attention to your compass and journal and you ll never get lost completing quests finding a particular town finding a particular person etc One spoiler immediately starting the game go through the first few steps of the main quest You will be sent to a monastary that will supply your low level character with free equipment and a free horse Also the official website has downloadable mods for sale for 0 99 1 99 etc per mod Buy those It is as close to a perfect game as you can get and only one patch has come out so far 
Most PC s do not run the game as is It used to be and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new that as long as your PC was not too old you could run any game on it No so with Oblivion and some other new games I believe To run Oblivion as is you need a machine with a high end graphics card So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming or specifically updated the graphics card Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen without telling you why While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC a dual core with 1G of RAM And no it still does not run if you install the manufacturer s patch However all is not completely lost I was able to install Oldblivion just Google for it to find the site and another patch from the Oldblivion site and now it runs acceptably With Oldblivion and the other patch the graphics are still pretty good better than Morrowind though understandably not nearly as good as the screenshots online however it tends to crash every so often its unclear whether or not this is due to graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs in the game Nonetheless if have a high end graphics card or have the patience to apply all the unofficial online patches the game is pretty cool I was not a big fan of Morrowind but Oblivion has a number of improvements over Morrowind in my opinion 1 You can fast travel just open up a map and click to all cities and any sites that you have been to before And even when you cannot fast travel to a new place you can usually walk in a nearly straight line there in Morrowind it was maddening to go someplace since I often would end up running into mountains that I could not climb 2 Oblivion is not so dark and gloomy like Morrowind was 3 NPC speak this to me is a huge benefit in Morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would have to to through pages of text dialouge if I wanted to read I would pick up a book not play a computer game 4 There is a quest arrow that points towards the person you need to see In Morrowind it was incredibly tedious to track people down 5 And finally a minor point the names of people do not look like the programmers mashed the hand on the keyboard in Morrowind there were quests like go see ERAJGUKADFHS and ask about SAKDFHSLKDJF I just don t need that when I am playing a computer game One thing that I do not care for about Oblivion is the way the monsters level with you The first character I had I got up to level 15 and found myself being beaten up by goblins Unless you powergame that is stragically plan your leveling to maximize stats and combat skills or turn the difficulty way down the leveling of monsters makes the game a real pain combat related quests such as with the painted trolls should not get harder the more you level All in all it is a pretty fun game but before you buy make sure you have a high end graphics card or a lot of patience 
OMGWTF I m still a weakling Neat game but I shouldn t have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 The leveling system developer should have stayed off the crack pipe Also I m the Hero of Kavatch but I don t want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds The fact that I saved a town also apparently doesn t entitle me to even pick up an item if I don t own it w o being thrown in prison Very realistic 
Excellent but I still miss Morrowind The title doesn t imply anything negative I just really liked morrowind s exotic cities and cultural clashes This game makes you move your virtual life from Morrowind to the Imperial Province which is more similar to an earthly historical place Now that the sentimental stuff is out of the way on to the good stuff The graphics are much much better than Morrowind My system isn t over the recommended settings but I still play smoothly by choosing my settings correctly and it looks very good The models are much more detailed to the effect that you ll sometimes even gasp when you run into an attractive female who got her clothes stolen Sound is just as good as Morrowind and the main theme is a tribute to the Morrowind main theme There are a lot of voices in this game and it is possible to not have to read any of the conversions and just listen to the NPCs You can thankfully skip over lines that you don t want to hear if you are a fast reader Just like Morrowind you can also add new songs to the music folder if you want to use a custom soundtrack Control is improved Blocking is so much better that even if you aren t a warrior you can hold your own in melee against the common enemies The new magic casting does take some getting used to and so does the unified menus Controls do feel more like a console game and Oblivion s battles are a lot more action based than Morrowind s As for gameplay most of the changes are for the better The cities were improved seemingly using a Gothic 2 like model It seems to me they also took hunting and the radiant AI from playing that game It fits TES very nicely Enemies level up now so leveling up the wrong skills may get you into trouble at the higher levels but so far it hasn t bothered me Trading is different and I m not sure it s improved that much Lockpicking gives you the option to do a minigame but you can also do it the Morrowind way Speechcraft is thankfully much more improved Stealing is also more elaborate Steal from a store and hang around and the guards will come looking for you even if nobody actually saw you stealing The missions are now more elaborate and even the most trivial ones may surprise you with some funny emotional and even sensual topics Travel is different with no more stilt riders boats or guild guides Now you have a horse option they actually fight too and a fast travel option to places you ve been to before or major sites you haven t been to yet But in the end this is still TES All you re old Morrowind tricks like repairing bound armor shooting arrows while levitating beating people to a pulp with your bare hands and gaining magicka by fighting your own creatures is still possible On a personal note I m glad the Atronach birthsign now gives you 50 spell absortion along with stunted magicka If you liked Morrowind you ll most likely like this one as well Players who were put off by Morrowind s low level combat should try Oblivion Players who traditionally don like deep RPGs should give it a chance Like hack and slash games Create a stereotypical warrior and join the fighters guild Like stealth games Create a stereotypical thief and join the thieves guild You may just like it enough to try out new things 
Oblivion de lo mejor No solo para los RPG Fans Se que hay muchos que no gustan de los RPG s de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos Asi que al empezar a jugar Oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas y el gameplay Al principio no me pareci� gran cosa pero cuando sales la primera vez a campo abierto Incre�ble te quita el aliento Una vez empiezas a recorrer todo el reino de Tamriel el juego te atrapa y cr�anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar y seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos y maravillas Cuando pienses en Oblivion no imagines un juego tipo las Final Fantasy o los t�picos RPG s japoneses este es un RPG que apela a un publico mucho m�s amplio Aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda o aventuras como Enclave e incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como Splinter Cell encontraran aqu� algo para ellos Camino a la gloria ES4 Oblivion te coloca en el Rol de un prisionero que por alguna raz�n fuiste parte de un sue�o del Emperador Uriel Septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar a Tamriel de un oscuro grupo Daedra conocido como Mythic Dawn De esta forma empiezas a vagar por las catacumbas ayudando a los guardias a proteger al emperador sin embargo el emperador es asesinado y tu eres la unica esperanza de detener a este culto y cerrar las puertas de Oblivion y as� detener la invasi�n de los Daedra a Tamriel Es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaci�n de tu personaje que habilidades deseas cuales ser�n tus fortalezas y debilidades Dependiendo te tus elecciones podr�s ser un guerrero un mago un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer a cualquier raza que desees Conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia �Como hacerlo eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste hay toda una gama de habilidades a desarrollar Empaca tus cosas Oblivion posee infinidad de misiones a realizar aproximadamente 500 horas de juego claro esta hay una misi�n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador y cerrar la puertas de oblivion sin embargo si as� lo deseas puedes ignorarla y tomar otras b�squedas como unirte a la Hermandad de los magos � a la de los Luchadores pelear en la arena ganar fama y fortuna o simplemente explorar y ayudar a los diferentes habitantes de Tamriel en sus vidas diarias Cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras ahora estaremos hablando de Oblivion El reino de Tamriel es enorme hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra los personajes parecen tener vida propia sus problemas discusiones mitos etc Ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas y mazmorras donde explor�ndolas descubrir�s toda clase de Items que te ayudar�n completar las tareas que hayas escogido Lo bueno lo malo y lo caro En el apartado grafico Oblivion realmente te quita el aliento los paisajes las monta�as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes Los �rboles se mueven con el viento igual que el follaje Los atardeceres y amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares esto agregado a que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace a Oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio a fin si es que hay fin Sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca etc sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece Y lo caro todo tiene un precio si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una PC relativamente potente Aunque hay un parche para PC s no muy potentes Shut the Jaws of Oblivion Oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del a�o asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fant�stico Si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje a Tamriel y cr�anme ser�n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras 
The highest evolution of the computer RPG to date If you have an RPG bone in your body back in the days of paper RPG who didnt dream of a game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting the undead finding magic loot avoiding traps all with near cartoon quality graphics Thats the game we all wanted Now finally I believe this is the first game that fufills all aspects of what all RPG ers envisioned in a game The world is free form the enemy creatures are well animated and pose a challenge in combat all the characters dialogue is real speech Theres a strong and challenging main quest to complete As well you can take your character on many twists and turns Want to be a professional thief you can do it Want to be a murderer and do hits you can shame on you Want to be a good guy and help out people you can The gameworld itself is massive you can trapse across the gorgeous and sometimes dangerous countryside crossing rivers mountains grassy plains The seasons change and the stars light up at night it really is graphically amazing Thats where it pays to have a top of the line PC the graphics are amazing so you better have a current system You can get by with say a Athlon 3000xp and a 9800pro but with part prices so cheap why would you want to Not Doom3 not Halflife 2 not Prey this is the game thats pressing people to upgrade their machine And with Athlon 64 s and 16 pipe 256mb graphics cards fairly cheap i d say its worth upgrading just to play this game I have an Athlon 64 4000 and a 256mb x800xl and I run the game at 1024x768 at high detail The game ran well but in some outdoor locations and in combat when things got busy it would slow down a bit so I dialed back the draw distance a bit and the plant draw distance and now everything is almost always very smooth I think plant draw distance is one of the easiest things to dial back to get more FPS without sacrificing visual quality I really cant do this game justice in a review I am at a loss for words to fully convey this games greatness However I will say if you have even a tiny love of paper or computer RPGs this game is for you If you enjoy final fantasy type games the freedom in this game will bowl you over If you like the idea of a free form fantasy world you will want to get this In fact I have a hard time imagining anyone with the proper computer to run this game not liking it Though if I had to imagine someone who wouldnt its someone who hates stories cant be bothered with dialogue and simply wants to blast things for hours But they have Doom 3 so they re happy too 
Cute game for kids in the 6 10 range This is a well done game especially if you liked the movie Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there s a cute storyline to the game There are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next There s a pretty small age window that its good for I d say about 6 to 10 Under 6 the stages are too hard Over 10 they re sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it s still well done and worth buying 
Finally a true kid friendly game Many games my kids have aren t actually geared towards kids This game is perfect for children It s fun without being too hard or easy My children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained I highly recommend this as a great family game Many games we can take turns playing 
Works great This works great for charging both my DS Lite and classic DS from USB I also like the included keychain flashlight it s kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger but it s quite bright and handy to have anyways I m not sure why the previous reviewer says that it doesn t fit the DS Lite it does perfectly Perhaps she is trying to use the GBA Micro adapter that is included You don t need to the adapter is only to charge classic DS GBA or GBA Micro the cable itself is all you need to charge DS Lite 
average game madden comes out again but with some stupid lead blocking controls i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls y cant they come out with something good 
PS2 Madden 2007 I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see However my major disappointment comes from the graphics I understand the ps2 doesn t not have the standards of the XBox360 but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for I just hope when the ps3 comes out Madden will rerelease the game for it to give the XBox360 owners something to whine about EA should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have 
Only Way To Go Just Great All around nice work from Microsoft and their newly launched Marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers Xbox Live really is a great gaming experience 
Xbox 360 is great I love the xbox 360 I got it about 2 months ago I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3 i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun The graphics and sound are great to I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference you need real cables people dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug The wireless controllers are great the main thing are games theres good ones and bad ones choose very wisely But there alot of good ones right now to choose from And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive theres no other way to have it 
Xbox 360 Is The Best Console Out There For The Money I just bought a Xbox 360 Pro System a couple of weeks ago from my local Gamespot Store along with Call of Duty 3 I later on got Gears of War from Circuit City The Xbox 360 Pro System is by far the best console system out there no matter what anybody says for the money Yes the Sony PlayStation 3 has the Blu Ray disc media format and the Nintendo Wii system has the new remote controller for 3 D movement But both the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems just came out and both systems already have major bugs in them There are already alot of people out there who regret buying one of those systems If your smart you ll wait a year until all the bugs are fix in both those console systems and then think about purchasing one of those systems That is what I did with the Xbox 360 Yes there were major problems with the Xbox 360 when it first came out just like there are major problems now with the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems I waited a year until Microsoft fixed all the bugs in the Xbox 360 and then I went out and purchased it Right now the Xbox 360 has the best selection of games out there The Xbox Live Marketplace is the best online service out there Go read the reviews for the few games that are out for the PlayStation 3 and you will see what I mean about which system has better games to play There are already a huge selection of games to play on the Xbox 360 with a whole bunch of new games for the Xbox 360 coming out next year Unfortunately there are not too many new games coming out for the PlayStation 3 or the Nintendo Wii next year Also the Nintendo Wii has very poor graphics and you can t play DVD movies on it and the PlayStation 3 has very few games to choose from to play and it also has poor online service The Xbox 360 is already one year ahead of the other two systems on being out in the retail market and that my friend will make a huge difference on which system to choose from to go out to buy and play 
This game roxs my sox I bought this game a couple months ago and I absolutely love it I am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will LOVE ths it s great excerise and very challenging with cool music It s like DDR only with your hands Try it I promise you ll have a great time I could play it all day 
excellent fun for all ages If you already have an Eye Toy and your favorite game on it is Beat Freak then you have to get Eye Toy Groove The 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from Elvis to Good Charlotte As a 46 year old woman I got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in This is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 Even the preschoolers I occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than I can say for Dance Dance Revolution 
Fun and challenging My daughter got the Eye Toy for her birthday and we recently added the Dance Groove game to the collection She and her friends 10 yrs of age really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids She says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera 
A fantastic sequel To be honest I was a little wary of Disgaea 2 The first game was so much fun and I was a bit worried that the sequel would just suck Worry not fair gamers for Disgaea 2 takes most though not all of what s good about the first game and builds upon it Incredibly humourous localization Check Colorful anime styled artwork Check Detailed amusing and slightly outdated 2D sprites Check Highly amusing and strangely moving storyline Check Etna Check The Dark Assembly new and improved so it s much more enjoyable Check My only quibble is that they stripped out a lot of the unlockable classes which takes a little bit of the fun out of obsessively levelling your characters However as you can tell from my rating that is only a quibble and it s totally balanced out by all the other improvements that they made Overall if you enjoyed the first game you ll enjoy this one just as much I m so very thankful that this did not suffer from sequel itis 
Great game but do not expect another Hour of Darkness That might be a little misleading the battle mechanics are almost exactly the same as those in the first game heck as in most of Nippon Ichi s games though this series I think is the best of the lot That part of the game absolutely delivers Great classes Good monsters and a more consistent class sytem for them Excellent assortment of items Good variety of levels However as far as the story an area in which Hour of Darkness was solid this game falls on its face The writing is iffy the plot itself is contrived the characters while certainly amusing are predictable and it just leaves so much to be desired If you re looking for a storyline you can get involved in go back to the first game If you re in it for the gameplay though don t miss this one With some class tweaks and a few added features Cursed Memories is a worthy addition for those who simply want the monotonous level up madness that some of us thrive on Great 2D art mixed with fun environments HILARIOUS quips and item descriptions engaging fights and hundreds of hours literally of entertainment 
You ll Have Fond Memories of this Game Three years ago Disgaea hit the scene and was by far one of the best games to grace the Playstation 2 Now we have Disgaea 2 Disgaea 2 follows the If it ain t broke don t fix it path While Disgaea 2 is really familiar to the first one that s not a bad thing the first one was absolutely perfect Disgaea 2 does connect with the first one So this really is a sequel It isn t however a sequel that requires knowledge of the events in the first game You may very well run into familiar characters but on the whole Disgaea 2 is a whole new story Adell is the only human in a town full of monsters and it s all the overlord Zenon s fault He s put a curse on the town to make them all lose their memories When Adell s mom decides to perform a ritual that will bring forth the Overlord she instead brings forth Zenon s daughter Rozalin So you ll now have to venture off in search of the overlord The best thing about Disgaea 2 s storyline is the same thing that worked well with the first one It has a perfect balance between it s moments of seriousness and humor It s a well crafted story that isn t afraid to break the rules The game really plays no different from the first one You ll go into battle and be able to do a bunch of different things While it does play like your basic tactical RPG it throws in some things that make it more worthwhile Like the geopanels on the ground that if a character stands on they get special enhancements You can also do things like have one character stand on another s shoulders If you don t like the effects though you can just destroy the power source It s not as easy as it was in the first one however These power sources now get up and walk around The game is also rather complex Battling is no walk in the park If you re familiar with tactical strategy games then Disgaea 2 will be easy to learn You ll deploy ten of your characters on battle at a time They can perform team attacks or attack indivually You can use this to your advantage but your enemies also must be kept in mind They don t slouch They ll attack at the same time and can take your characters down pretty fast if you don t know what you re doing Of course Disgaea 2 also sports some rather bizarre moments in battle just like it s prequel For one thing you can order a pizza in the middle of battle This is just one of many different things you can do Items also level up and your characters levels will soar It won t take you that long to complete the main storyline but purists will find that Disgaea 2 much like the first one is almost never ending in terms of complete mastery Your characters levels will rise far into the hundreds and even thousands It s almost never ending You can also replay story missions over and over and go into optional dungeons Items also level up You can go into the item world and level up your items You can level up just about any item Your weapons armor even that pizza you ordered These moments of the game also feel never ending at times Disgaea 2 pretty much looks and feels like the first one It s simply a beautiful game It s got spectacular artwork It s 2D artwork but it s some of the most beautiful in the gaming world It also sounds really good keeping the theme of the first game in tact The voice acting is probably the best part They re so lively and vibrant and the dialogue is crafty and filled to the brim with humor Some of the humor mind you is probably not suitable for your little kid There some sexual and dirty jokes but they re really funny Disgaea 2 is just an all out blast The game for one thing is huge It may only take 40 hours or so to complete the main quest but to master the game That ll take much longer than just about any tactical RPG out there There s so much to be done and it s by far one of the most addicting games out there So if you do like tactical strategy RPGs then by all means play this game You ll love it If you loved the first Disgaea you will love this game There s no doubt about it The Good +Loveable characters +Fantastic storyline +Addictive gameplay +This game is huge +Beautiful artwork +Complex battle system +Vibrant and colorful voice acting among the best in gaming The Bad The only real bad thing about this game if you can even say it s bad is that it doesn t really go above and beyond the first Disgaea In other words there s not a whole lot of new content or anything like that However it s still a bit more original than most other tactical RPGs out ther 
More of the same and that s a good thing I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea As such I will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note Having said that let s begin The game begins in the land of Veldime an alternate world from that of the first game where an evil Overlord named Zenon has hidden from well everyone When he came into Veldime however he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons The effects weren t all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon there will be no turning back Thus the hero Adell oddly enough the only person unaffected by Zenon s curse sets out to defeat the Overlord In the opening there is an attempt to summon Zenon to Adell so he can fight him but it goes awry and Zenon s daughter accidentally gets summoned instead Bound to Adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father albeit not without scheming a bit herself In a nutshell the story is good Nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original The only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do Stack Attacks and if you are quick enough throw diagnally The basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack In doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground Essentially a team attack of up to 10 characters There have been updates to the Dark Assembly with 6 factions of Senators being introduced And it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk random vote basically or even asleep no vote at all Perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies You can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling having to much hp sp mana or even killing your own allies The benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get it is easier to pass proposals at the Dark Assembly and for every felony on a character they gain 1 extra exp This works all the way up to 300 felonies 300 exp bonus The game has made all the necessary additions to make the gameplay top that of the original however in my opinion there feels like something is missing The characters seem a bit more by the book and not as wonderfully absurd as the original That and the voice acting isn t quite as good as the that of the first Disgaea plus Etna has a new voice actress Despite all of that however the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot All in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game While some may like the changes in the characters and others may not there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long if not longer 
Great fun casual RPG with humor Disgaea 2 is a fun cartoony combination of RPG and tactical game You are Adell a young fighter who pairs up with Rozalin in order to defeat the evil Zenon You build up a party of characters including fighters healers and pretty much any monster type you defeat in battle As you wander through the lands you often find monsters to conquer During these battles you end up on a grid Each character can move a certain distance per turn to get around and behind your enemy In some ways the game is like a typical RPG There is an evil main boss to conquer There are various smaller enemies along the way There are power ups to collect and weapons to buy The graphics are not meant to be realistic or cutting edge They are casual cute and fun Disgaea really shines in its humor It s not meant for the really little its characters joke about looking up girls skirts and there are swears such as kick their ass Still the game is generally very family friendly and has a ton of fun in it Most of the villagers have been turned into demons and have quite wild personality changes The main character Adell is still human When you go around talking to the other people one muses why Adell is still human Is it because he s the main character Rozalin Zenon s daughter is a very spoiled stuck up teen girl and her dialogue is quite funny Many flaws of other games have been taken care of here When you go into shops they have new items each time giving you a selection to choose from that you will find interesting You can customize new characters creating a party that is just perfect for your gaming style The voices are cutesy in the traditional anime style and the sounds fit in well with the world The plot is fairly involved and really draws you along Again this isn t a dark serious story of angst and power It s a fun light hearted romp through a fun fantasy world where you can play for a few hours save and pick up the story the next time you have free time Well recommended 
A great game When I went online looking at reviews I started to get rather edgy about buying this game but OMG This is a great game Sure it isn t the best FF game out there but it is definately one of the better gun games out there Sometimes the graphics get rather distorted but I think that the A+ graphics in the middle of the game really make up for it I m glad that Vincent finally gets his own game In short you people who hate this game are wierd 
THE FFVII UNIVERSE RETURNS WITH A VENGEANCE I honestly don t know why everybody is so negative regarding this game I think it s phenominal Great missions great story and game play and the variety in the weapon customization feature makes for fun little side quests Overall it s a great addition to the FFVII universe and I definitely hope to see more games with these characters coming out soon Even a remake of the original FFVII would be grand On the whole Vincent Valentine is one bad dude The bosses are interesting and cool and the links to the original game are awesome If you re a fan buy this game If you re not a fan and want to have an interesting gaming experience the please consider this title The Timewarrior has spoken 
Final Fantasy XII I bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact I haven t heard any noise he is to busy playing it 
RPG or Final Fantasy fans good Shooter FPS fans bad Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off aside PSP s Crisis Core and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world The game seems like a must play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike and it is Thinking most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs this game is relatively easier than popular FPS shooters like Halo Being an RPG fan yet still wanting to learn the story of the game I was very happy for the easy difficulty though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode The controls are a little bad but nothing that someone can t get used to For one of Square s second or third shooter games this one is pretty good I d recommend if you re doing what I did and playing it for story then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them you never have to get them again The guide is actually pretty good for this game as well as the soundtrack If you re a fan of the Final Fantasy music definitely pick the soundtrack up Lastly if you re a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan get this game and everything related to it It s worth it I couldn t put this game down even if some characters are a bit under developed If you re a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed 
R Type makes it to the next gen consoles R Type Final 2004 INTRODUCTION Over the years Irem s R Type series has been one of the finest side scrolling space shooter series out there From its dawn in the eighties to the modern age the series has always pleased its fans serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike Many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike In 2004 the series finally hit the big consoles of the era The Playstation Two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive R Type Final How did this new modernized version of the series fare Read on and find out OVERVIEW R Type Final was released for the Playstation Two gaming console in early 2004 The game features a number of different gameplay modes configurations vehicles and other variables to keep things interesting The game is a product of the Irem Corporation REVIEW I have always loved the R Type series and I was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment And after finally giving the game a whirl I must say for the most part I am impressed The game stays true to its roots while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh Let s see where this game succeeds and where it falls flat THE GOOD CLASSIC STYLE R TYPE GAMEPLAY If you ve played any other game in this series you ll pick this one up right away The game plays similar in style to its predecessors and as such is very easy to learn if you ve played any other game the series has to offer LOTS OF NEW ELEMENTS THROWN INTO THE EXPERIENCE When you start the game you ll have your choice of three ships but you can unlock more there are over a hundred ships total The game also features plenty of new weaponry and power up items If you play the game heavily it s going to reward you well CHALLENGING If you re looking for a challenge you ve come to the right place This game serves up its fair share of challenging elements and it never lets up Even game masters will be challenged CONTROLS ARE EASY TO LEARN AND EFFECTIVE If you played any installment of the series on the Super Nintendo you ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme THE BAD DESPITE ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IT S STILL THE SAME GAME Even though I like all the improvements this game has made to the series at heart it s still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago If you didn t like the series then this new installment isn t going to change your mind NO IMMEDIATE REGENERATION WHEN KILLED This has always been a huge flaw of this series and I am disappointed to see that this wasn t fixed In most space shooters you regenerate immediately after you die right where you died Not the case with this series GRAPHICS AREN T THAT GREAT FOR A NEXT GENERATION GAME Granted the gameplay is the most important thing here but still I think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available OVERALL Despite the obvious issues this is one of the best versions of R Type I have played to date If you re a big time fan of this series this installment is well worth checking out If you re not a fan though this one isn t going to change your mind Still if you are one of the many R Type fans out there don t hesitate to give this one a whirl EDITION NOTES This game it seems wasn t produced for a very lengthy period of time As such it seems to be rather difficult to come by You re probably going to have to order it online or check around in used game stores This one is tough to come by new 
R Type the legendary spaceship shooter R Type the legendary spaceship shooter has come blasting back with her classic horizontally scrolling blueprint intact Through waves of alien miscreants you ll fight for each gained inch of space battlefield while collecting power up items to enhance your ship s most primary weapon the Mighty Orb Of Death With R Type s trademarked invincible sphere docked to the front or rear of the ship MOOD can unleash deadly firestorms upon foes or be hurled forward to attack remotely and smash through most anything it comes in contact with Though the gameplay is classic the graphics have been updated to polygons thereby qualifying for a Sony of America license with lots of glowing lighting effects flowing gracefully over them Most enemies are basic spaceships but some levels have well animated living creatures like the badass water worm things that slither though level 2 Sadly even with crazy alien monsters uber weapons 100+ ships and giant bosses R Type is a rather unexciting shooter The MOOD is a shield against nearly all projectiles so most levels are spent calmly avoiding being pinched between narrow passages and otherwise harmless enemy trains Not a befitting task for humankind s last hope 
Great Game My 9 year old and 16 year old fight over this game My 9 year old owns the game She has asked me to buy her 16 year old sister the game so she will leave hers alone It is a great game that will hold your attention 
I almost blew this game away Literally Ok Now I know I m not the brightest star in the sky but whodathunk that when the game calls for you to blow while stewing or boiling something that you are actually supposed to blow into the mic I failed at so many recipes just because I didn t know what to do when the recipe called for blowing Yes I know what you are saying Did you read the instructions before you played the game Of course not This game appears juvenile and primative but it has proven to me at least to be the most advanced NDS game to date Even if you don t enjoy puzzle games or you are a Teen Mature gamer this game is worth owning just to experience the full capabilities of your DS I d hate to know what the Mature Game Developers are doing with this whole blow thing Yuck 
cooking fun I am 23 years old and this game hasn t left my DS since I bought it a month ago It s incredibly fun I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames You get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking I love these weird japanese games I only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes I heard they are making a Wii version of cooking mama so I m hoping that one will have more recipes 
Fun even for older kids Hi I am 11 yrs old and my next door neighboor s little sister got a pink nintendo lite She is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday With the nintendo ds lite she recieved cooking mama I started to play it and it was really fun It is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food My favorite is making the pizza and beef stew 
A great Arcade Game Boy the folks at EA really outdone themselves this time Just when I thought 2003 was the greatest NCAA ARCADE game ever EA releases NCAA 2006 This blows 2003 out the water I never knew it could be sooo much fun having the CPU complete 80 Yard TD pass every single time Nor did I know that the bomb is the most acurate pass in the game Who needs realism in a football sim when you can just bomb the ball down field and have it be on target every single time This game punishes you for trying to play like a real football game so why not just bomb it every time If your receiver drops a wide open 5 yard pass that just means he wants you to throw it 60 yards down the field and he ll have a much better chance of catching it Where else can you find a game where QB s constantly break tackles spin on one foot and throw a perfect spiral 40 yards down the field right on target ITS IN THE GAME WOW I love how RB s can break 7 tackles on there way to a 81 yard TD run Oh yeah those safeties are beasts They apparantly have a very strong gravitational pull which causes your TE and OL to completely ignore the D Linemen and linebackers and run to block the safeties who are not even in the play Every safety should be in the NFL if they are able to do that WOW Oh and don t forget about the kickers Only in an arcade game can a mid 70 s rated kickers can drill 50+ yard FGs against the wind with 10 yards to spare every single time And if you don t believe that this is a great Arcade game check out the scoring of my latest game Sexton threw 6 picks yet still had the composure to throw 6 TD passes and for nearly 500 yards on only 13 passes WOW IT REALLY IS IN THE GAME 
Better than Madden I just got this game last night and I am amazed EA Sports really delivered with this one The Race for the Heisman mode is simply amazing All the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing The game is probably the best football game i have ever played Definately a must have for any Football Fan 
Now everyone has a reason to go to college NCAA Football 2006 captures the college atmosphere extremely well The game is loads of fun The load times are decent the Dynasty mode adds tremendous replay value the Quest for the Heisman is a pseudo ripoff of NFL 2K series Crib feature I still love this game I even like the music It doesn t bother me that Lee Corso s and Kirk Herbstreit s commentary is repetitive The only thing I take issue with is every year EA brags about the strength of the AI and yet you can run the option successfully hundreds of times while the computer controlled team struggles to find a defense capable of stopping you Maybe that is why some people prefer to play online opponents Let me wrap up This a great game The graphics are impressive and EA did a wonderful job here Buy it for your son buy it for your daughter or buy for yourself You will love it I wish I could provide a more helpful review Head on over to and read the wonderful review they gave this game That will be more helpful than anything I can contribute 
Very destructive This game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities You can even go the wrong way For me older adult it was fun to play with my kids but I found it repetitive and boring after a while Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game 
No Title NFSU does capture the idea of building and racing cars but I think they could go a little further into the design of your so called pimp mobile The only interior you get to design is the trunk I think they could at least do the seats or the wheel Outside design is A OK Anything from sideskirts to multi colored vinyels you make your car fierce The plot line in single player mode really dosen t go that deep your just some guy who wants to get his title back In multi player you race your own cars in tracks you already won but the down side is the whole graphics in two player is horrible It is a game worth getting but you might sell it later on 
A good deal despite a few problems I recently bought this wheel at a local Game Crazy in anticipation of the upcoming release of Gran Turismo 4 and so far despite a few problems i ve been satisfied with my purchase The Good 1 Great compatibility with PS2 racing titles it works with basically all PS1 and PS2 racing games not just Nascar games I ve been using it primarily with Gran Turismo 3 2 Easy control customization 3 Feels good in your hands 4 Well made The Bad 1 I wish the adjustable lap rest could lock into place sometimes it slips back in when your taking a tough corner 2 While the pedals are well made do not use them on a carpeted surface they slip Customize the wheel like i did setting the gas and brake to L1 and R1 and dont even bother with the pedels unless you have a better surface for them 3 The wheel allows customization of it s sensitivity but i wish it could get a little more sensitive then it can more life like Overall it s a good solid purchase if you can t afford to drop a 150 bucks on something top of the line It s definately alot better then using a controller on a racing game 
Dualshock controller I ve only had this controller for a few days and I have found that the layout is the same as the black controller I do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game 
The original This is the original Playstation controller and it is the best It feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy If you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling I strongly reccommend do not buy the big Mad Catz controller It does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks Just stick with the Sony controler it is the best of the best 
Almost my favorite of the 3 main systems controllers I ve pretty much been partial to the Playstation controllers since I got my PS1 back in 1997 When I saw the Nintendo 64 controller I nearly puked The joystick in the middle didn t make any sense to me I looked at the GameCube controller and wasn t exactly impressed It looked kinda goofy asymmetric maybe Well when I finally picked one up I found that it fit my hands much better than the PS models This would be my favorite controller if Nintendo changed a few things 1 The Z button is too hard for me to reach 2 The C joystick and the D pad are in awkward positions Fortunately most games don t really force you to use these much but if you re going to put buttons on a controller make them all easily accessible Due to these flaws I can t really say it s better than the PlayStation s design They re probalby tied 
Best controller yet Gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 Xbox and PS2 s controllers have buttons that are the same size it s really confusing really On Gamecube s you know the A buttons the big one B s the small one and X and y are the kidney shaped ones Hard to tell them apart right 
This is a great system please read it will help This is truly a good system Iv e sat on it dropped it kicked it thrashed it and it still is working fine I did consider buying the psp at first but then i thought I have an ipod nano a dvd player and a laptop I didn t see the point for having 2 of the above Also honsetly who would want to go on the web with a slow psp CAn you imagine how hard it is to type Anyway the games i recommend for the nds is mario kart ds animal crossing megaman battle network five and for people that are reall hard core gamers spiderman this is an extrmeley har game trust me Also i do find picto chat quite usless 33ft range isn t enough Also i was reading the psp reviews and about 85 percent of them said that the psp is for more mature gamers What got me is that alot of kid reviews were saying that All these kids playing M rated games is sorta scary but that s just my opion Also if you have the fat ds dont buy a ds lite Thres no need unless your eyesight is bad All it has is a brighter screen and a sleeker design So it s not werth it Once again this is only my opion im just giving my advice The wifi feature is pretty cool I am aware that psp has this too by the way Anyway mario kart ds does a great job usuing wi fi The feeling of sitting in your room playing with people across the world on this handheld is quite an extroindary feeling Well all in all if you really need a gaming device with good grapghics and multi media features get the psp But im warning you it is very very fragile If you have a music device and a computer and just want a good gaming system with great games and is very durable get nds They are both good systems just think about what you need in a system Do you want a gaming device or a multimedia device Its your choice in the end I hope this review has helped I just want to make your shopping a tad bit easiers Cheers Hisham Amery 
PSP AND DS BOTH RULE will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both 
xbox its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time Same differance with highspeed and dialup If you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally I like my 360 remote 
A review to clear up some details I put a great deal of interest in my purchases With a lot of extra down time at work and an internet connection I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card But this product the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway Let me tell you This remote is PERFECT if 1 You would like one easy to use remote to control both basic TV and an Xbox 360 that doubles as your DVD player 2 The only buttons you would need for the TV are Channels Volume TV speaker output control only Numerical channel input Muting INTPUT SELECTION yes it CAN switch between your TV s inputs Return to toggle between 2 TV channels and Power 3 You do not need specialized advanced buttons found on a OEM remote or advanced learning remote for the TV 4 You do not need to control a A V receiver DVD player other than XBOX 360 or a digital cable box Tivo DVR etc 5 You are on a budget but would still like a quality remote If you can say yes to all or most then don t hesitate to grab one of these remotes You will be completely satisfied Especially with immediate access to the tactile DVD buttons versus the 360 s annoying on screen DVD navigation For this feature it is almost worth the 30 alone P S I also own a Logitech Harmony 880 for the living room which I highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above 
THE game to own on Wii I picked up a wii with this game on launch day after much research Let me just say that I own NES i got used N64 Dreamcast GC and now Wii I was getting tired of gaming I am definitely not a hardcore gamer and in my precious free hours when I come home from work I don t want to sit around and get fat that s what TV is for Anyway this game really gets you moving The mini games are often hilarious you WILL randomly LOL while playing and fun The shooting levels that end each set of mini games utilize the wii controller in the most natural way and it is immersive and intuitive I played this game to about 33 completion the first day I had it This is unusual for me I figure I ll get about ten hours of gameplay out of story mode if things continue at the present pace The game gives you an objective early on and this motivates you to progress through the mini games I like them so much that I have gone back and beaten the optional 4th mini game in each level I ve passed I can t speak for any of the other launch titles but I haven t had this much fun in single player gaming on a console ever And all of the mini games and shooting games you shoot plungers by the way are available for multiplayer after they have been beaten although some of them cannot be played concurrently by multiple players On a final note some of the mini games will physically wear you out Some of the games involving rapid movement running cow milking cow tossing carrot juice pumping may require you to catch your breath If you can t handle this then you ll be glad to know you can skip one of the mini games in each level But this physical exertion makes beating a mini game much more gratifying I cannot recommend this strongly enough Get this game 
For the hardcore only The classic Final Fantasy games 1 3 not 6 are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon Then you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs Potions and Ethers just to kill ONE monster For example the Behemoths found past B5 in the center of the moon and in Bahamuts cave will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member Most of the boss fights Asura Bahamut and tough monsters Behemoths Wicked Masks are gimmick fights Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game just cast Reflect on all of your party members Let me reinstate what the previous reviewers have said about this game + Crisp graphics + Great music + sound + Fun + More to do once you beat the game Somewhat short beat EG Zeromus in 18hrs 42mins Very difficult Prepare to grind 10 15 levels once you reach the center of the moon I enjoyed this and you can bet I m getting FF3 for the DS Great blast from the past a must buy for any Final Fantasy fan RPG lover or GBA owner 
Awesome I grew up on NES and SNES so seeing these games with new graphics and some bonus features was a very nice surprise for me I had just as much fun playing through this game as I did playing FFII for SNES Fortunately there were some improvements made in the dialogue which made it much easier to follow and the characters a little deeper Square added in some items and extra equipment Also you have the option to switch between all the characters towards the end of the game which gives the game a new flavor There are some small bugs in it but most don t hurt the gameplay too much The only downfall of this remake is that they took away the weapon doubling cheat Thus no more stacks of 99 Excallibur swords for Edge to throw 
A GREAT REMAKE When I heard that Square was going to remake Final Fantasy IV originally Final Fantasy II in the U S I was very excited This game is considered to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy games of all time All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy fan 
The heart of action games for the past present and future Half Life made its debut in 1998 and it shocked the entire world Half Life at the time featured stunning graphics gameplay and sound It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands and still to this date Half Life is a game that every action game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again but made it scream The game pits terrorists and counter terrorists in a fast paced sort of S W A T type of tactical firefighting gameplay Matches can consist of one of two types of game types The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal In both of the game types you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it Once the bomb is planted the counter terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated The counter terrorists usually have about thirty five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round The second type of gameplay is hostage rescue The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter terrorists nothing will happen except that now the counter terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style All of the weapons in the game are one hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality This is an element that makes Counter Strike such a superior game Counter Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world An entire culture has formed around it So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game It is purely because of the fantastically well crafted gameplay and not the graphics or the game would not be as popular as it is Players around the world will give you many deep reasons why it is such a great game But one without argument stands out It is simply the fact that versus other games it is difficult to make a kill in the game What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated it has been superiorly well done And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically a feeling of power will be experienced when holding an AK 47 or an M4 The game is quite punishing to new players and a total hapzard to players who have never played first person shooters or video games at all But regardless the stress you feel at first there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry difficulty as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game There are over ten maps in the game and each one has been done as a masterpiece All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment The most popular of all the maps de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies magazines shows etc Due to its style and simplicity it is a godly designed map and arguably the most popular map in first person shooter history One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps Since each map has been superbly designed a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play and with a different feel The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers This makes Counter Strike a game with an almost infinite value sort of feel The sound in Counter Strike is absolutely insanely realistic The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK 47 fire or pistol fire Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic and the player s best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of power This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game At the time Counter Strike had simply jaw dropping graphics Created all from the Half Life engine players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were At the present the game doesn t hold the same but it is what in the past has mattered Half Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at Games before the release of Half Life hardly had any sort of physics and if they did it would be something very basic Counter Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player s hard drive There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998 still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom Counter Strike will forever be played and is the heart of all action games from the past present and the future 
Old game yet popular today Ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular Fps First person shooter games out there Ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that I know still play cs today like myself From planting bombs to rescuing hostages you ll find this game enjoyable There are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 The screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers If your looking for a great fps game this is it = 
please please PLEASE play this game for more than an hour I always hear these things mainly of the point that it s unrealistic noone uses teamwork people are too preoccupied with their stats etc etc THAT may be true on many public servers though there are quite a few that aren t filled with morons and actually have people who play in a teamlike fashion and complete their objective over killing off the enemy in the time given I am one of those people who actually go for the objective And actually i am an admin at a server and if a terrorist is last and is camping out the round then i will slay him and warn him to stay on task Onto another point many people claim this to be so unrealistic it may be true on points like the M249 being a slow shooter very cumbersome and has too good aim for standing up and the fact that you die from 2 shots in the toe with the AWP those are all unrealistic points BUT if you think about it how much fun would it be to have to unload 5 clips and a half to killt he enemy COUGH HALO COUGH yes i just insulted halo because the enemies are too damn strong it drives me crazy along with the multiplayer being so annoying that you shoot the enemy with 3 shots from a sniper to kill And my final point is that there are people who aren t just preoccupied with their stats there are servers dedicated to having fun Yes fun on a counterstrike They will have a whole slew of crazy maps ways to make it even more insane and things such as that If you are interested in that try custom map servers ALL IN ALL This game is at a peak of perfection not even mentioning the huge amounts of customization involved in this game from weapons to player models 
I LOVE SHAMU 11 This game looks like so much fun I mean seriously who wouldn t want to play as Shamu and swim around and stuff I am very disappointed in the lack of screenshots and videos I really think this game has potential I ve been a huge fan of Shamu ever since I was a little kid Every summer when me and my family go to San Diego on vacation we always go and see him I have at least ten Shamu stuffed animals on my bed Anyways I m really looking forward to this game Think about it how many games allow you to go underwater and swim around as a creature that s home is the deep blue sea None With this game I won t have to get my stuffed animals all wet when I take them in my bath with me and play around Now if I want to pretend to be Shamu all I have to do is turn on my Gamecube Ya see if this game is advertised correctly it will definitely be one of the best games of the year We need to spread the work about this 
GREAT ENTERTAINMENT I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LOVES TO SING I DIDN T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE SO FUN THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD JOIN IN AND PLAY FOR HOURS IT WAS SO FUN THAT WE IMMEDIATELY HAD TO BUY THE KAREOKE CMT COUNTRY GAME ALSO 
Karaoke Revolution Rocks This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining I suggest this game for everybody 
Karaoke Revolution Party Volume IV This game is so much fun I don t own it but my friend does and I want to get it for my birthday But I think I should tell you why exactly anyone needs to own this game First of all there are 50 songs to sing Some you have to unlock but all you have to do is sing an already available song You re rated on the notes you are supposed to sing and if you don t exactly know the lyrics you can just hum along if you want to There is a character editor where you can make your name characteristics and clothing for a character Or you can pick an already made character The thing which is totally descriptive is that you can pick the body type of your character muscular curvy skinny the works There are unlockables too Over the course of the game you unlock songs outfits and accessories You can also do medly and sing off activities Medly is when you pick 5 songs and sing individual parts of each of them Sing off I can t remember if that is the actual name is when you do different types of styles of the game So you can do short song medly and all kinds of other things Then you can see who will be named champion of karaoke This game is incredibly fun and enjoyable as you can see If you do buy it I suggest you buy two microphones then you can sing duets also incredibly fun This game is perfect for all ages my neighbors have children at the age of 7 and he loves singing his heart out to some of his favorite songs So take my word for it and you will be thankful you did 
Fun For All Ages I bought this game for an adult birthday party It was a hit The game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game You have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc You can also change the mode to the traditional Karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen It s definitely for all ages even my two year old can t get enough of it The selection of music is good Be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes 
A ton of fun but aimed at the older crowd perhaps This was the first karaoke revolution game that I received and I enjoy it very much However the songs on the game I found were quite old even for someone like myself a senior in college I dont know about the rest of you but the 80 s were a blur for me I didnt know these songs very well which can put a major hinderance on game play I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know I found the sing and dance mode to be challenging and if you dont know the song by heart dont play it because you need to be watching the arrows for where your feet should be going I would also recommend a wireless microphone for the dance pad if they exist since a cord will get in the way of your dancing moves I thought it was really cool that the game had a sense of initiative with over 50 different unlockable items although 90 of which are items you can use to create your character or just a new character Some of the songs listed here need to be unlocked through game play I m sorry I couldnt think of every artist for these songs but if it isnt listed assume its from at least 15 years ago 1 I ve Had the Time of My Life 2 You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman Aretha Franklin 3 Ain t Nothing Like the Real Thing 4 Always 5 American Woman Lenny Kravitz 6 Brick House 7 Call Me 8 Crazy Aerosmith 9 Crazy In Love Beyonce 10 Do you Really Want to Hurt Me Boy George 11 Drive Incubus 12 Dust in the Wind 13 Endless Love Lionel Richie 14 Every Little Thing She Does is Magic 15 Everybody Wants to Rule the World 16 Everywhere Michelle Branch 17 Fame 18 Fly Hilary Duff 19 For You I Will Monica 20 Greatest Love of All Whitney Houston 21 Headstrong 22 Here I Go Again Whitesnake 23 I Dont Want to Be Gavin DeGraw 24 I Left My Heart in San Francisco 25 I Love Rock and Roll Joan Jett 26 I Will Always Love You Whitney Houston 27 If You Could Only See 28 I ll Be Edwin McCain 29 Material Girl Madonna 30 Me and Bobby McGee 31 Pain 32 Pieces of Me Ashlee Simpson 33 Play That Funky Music 34 Start Me Up Rolling Stones 35 Superstition Stevie Wonder 36 Sweet Caroline Neil Diamond 37 Takin Care of Business Bachman Turner Overdrive 38 That s Amore 39 The Game of Love Michelle Branch 40 Time After Time 41 Truth Is Recent but I dont know by who 42 Turn the Beat Around Miami Sound Machine 43 Unforgettable 44 Uptown Girl Billy Joel 45 Waiting For a Girl Like You 46 What I Like About You 47 Who Can It Be Now 48 You re My Best Friend 49 Take on Me 
Karaoke Revolution Party Volume 4 for the PS2 I recieved this as a gift for Christmas day as a surprise However there was a mishap at Wal Mart I guess and the mic they told my parents would work actually didn t so I hadn t been able to play until yesterday However now that it s all sorted out I was finally able to play using the USB PS2 head set And the game is actually so much fun First time I tried I went to familiar songs so I selected Pieces of Me I did so bad for the first time it was laughable it failed me just as I started the second verse But the game gets so much better after your first few tries After a while I was easily getting Gold on expert judging I immidiately like the challenge myself I was breezing through songs I grew up loving such as Irene Cara s Fame Wild Cherry s Play That Funky Music and Vicki Sue Robinson s Turn The Beat Around Then I was going through songs that were dominating my CD player not too long ago such as Ashlee Simpson s Pieces of Me Incubus Drive Beyonce s Crazy in Love and Hilary Duff s Fly And it s even better with classics such as Madonna s Material Girl Blondie s Call Me The Commodores Brick House and Whitney Houston I Will Always Love You one of the many I haven t quite nailed yet Now in order to make platinum from Beyonce do you have to actually sing like her No which makes the game very accessable However it doesn t hurt to be familiar with your singing voice Over all this is a very fun game with only one problem While the songs may be fun it s very VERY diverse Sometimes too diverse for it s own good Take for example that when me and my Mom want to play the songs we personally know are from two different erras I m wanting to bust out with Call Me and she s wanting to do I Left My Heart In San Francisco This can creates the only problem that unless your an all around music know it all which I m not quite there yet you ll end up doing the same songs over and over again But this really doesn t bring the game down If you ve been around and listened to a wide variety of songs then you should be able to cover a good 30 songs And not to mention it would make a great party game I would suggest getting this game if you re into having fun while not being afraid to make a fool of yourself 
An undeniably exciting RPG Fable has reached the point where all RPGs dream of going It s absolutely the pinnacle of the Adventure criteria The creators put you in the game they make it fun and they make it interesting Fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side dark side thing Because no other game concentrates on the subtle small important details and leisures quite like Fable does People will learn to adore you and people will learn to fear you you have a life you re not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do You hear that Fable is life It s adventure With a hint of unrealism just to the point to make you eternally amused to never decease until the fat lady sings Battle System 9 It s not guns it s not shoot em up blowing their brains out It s classic swordsplay and acrobatics blocking stabbing leaping lunging ducking dodging running away nothing to say except die Not to mention you can eat pie And it s all realistic hitting someone in the back the head the torso all cause different amounts of damage there s decapitations if you re lucky And the game even keeps track of your decapititations how cool is that There s archery shoot someone with and arrow the further you pull back your arrow the more damage it does but the less accurate it is You see Realism Plain clear and simple just like the drive thru guy ordered Leisure and life 9 Flirt with chicks flirt with guys Eww Flirt with chickens Whatever Flirt with anything with a face Get a special haircut facial hair tatoos some chicks find them attractive some scary Some may think you re Michael Jackson with a sword and get the heck away from you Hey that s life right One of the first games ever to allow you to get married to any woman or man and actually have sexual intercourse with them Yep you heard me sex Don t get cought up on the kinkiness boys it lasts for 5 seconds when the screen goes blank it s only for crickets and giggles Buy a house rent out your house live in your house steal from anyone kill anyone picklock doors fish dig kick chickens abuse your wife whatever you wanna do you can probably do it in Fable Main adventure 10 Yes this game is not all just chicken kicking There is a plot Filled with with surprises cliff hangers and ultimate rewards Gameplay 4 Quite possibly the only downside to this game It s TOO EASY I completed the game naked and didn t die once There is no way to change your difficulty This does however make the game much more fun as you don t have to reload and just get lucky in order to defeat an enemy But in all sincerity you may very well just whiz your way past this game in mere hours if you put your mind to it But then again that is why I am thankful for all the bonus material in the game because the actual game itself can go by pretty fast It may seem confusing and hard to get at first but all RPGs do so just stick with it 
My Favorite Game of All Time Fable is easily one of the greatest games to ever be released The story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past it is compelling and very entertaining The gameplay is excellent it s not your typical RPG since this plays like an action adventure game I love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like The game also plays like real life You can get married divorced have sex and buy houses even decorate them The game is so real that you can choose to be straight gay or bi sexual depending on who you sleep with The only thing that is missing is that you can t have children but that should change in future installments Another cool thing about the game is that the more evil you get the more people are afraid of you But the more of a hero and savior you become you are greeted with praise and clapping in every town you go to Overall this game is a MUST HAVE The replay value is extremely high I have played and beat the game many times and I m still not tired of it If you love RPGs or hate RPGs this is still fantastic I can t wait until Fable 2 is released which is currently being completed Get this it is simply amazing 
I Thought I Knew Fable was a much anticipated RPG that promised 40 50 hours of gamer action in the storyline and complete control over the life of the protagonist We waited for this game for what seemed like a LIFETIME and the build up for the game to finally arrive was almost more than RPG lovers could take but did it live up to the hype No my fellow gamers And it hurts me so to say it While the game promised to deliver several hours of stoyline play I was shocked when I completed the main storyline in less than 20 hours Now I m not one to doubt the sacred words of Lionhead Studios so I dedicated another 20 hours of my life to uncover different aspects of gameplay such as getting married changing outfits and body types becoming divinely evil or majestically good ect but it was all just so linear The paths were set the storyline already thought out and the character chosen you weren t given enough to keep the interest going I later dragged myself back to the game to play the storyline through again and though I admit that I enjoyed the game much more the second time through I just found myself not caring about it all Too many options were closed and the darn story was just too short The darker elements of the game were simply addicting such as the colleseum the prison which I played over and over and over and the story of your sister but it seems as though the people in charge of developing such side stories which we all SO LOVE got a little case of A D D Now I m not saying to avoid this game It s got just what some gamers may need to get into RPG s but for those of us who were expecting a game to completely pwn Morrowind well let s just move on or wait for a better thought our sequal crosses fingers 
A very good RPG with some flaws I have played through Fable and The Lost Chapters several times All in all this is a very fun game The classic RPG elements of leveling up buying or finding new and better weapons and armor choosing to focus on magic use or hack and slash and choosing to be good or evil are all included in Fable The graphics are superb for its time and the voice acting is top notch In addition the storyline is quite good and is more complex than the average RPG save the world tale I have heard some complaints of Fable being too short but if you take all the quests and max out all levels the game length should be just fine unless you are expecting a 50+ hours Morrowind experience Where Fable loses some points is the controller setup The button configuration can be overwhelmingly complex so much so that finding yourself using an item you did not mean to use can be a frequent occurance In addition you may find yourself using magic at an inopportune time simply because you pressed the R trigger by mistake The bow aiming feature might pop on at a bad time like when you are being attacked by 4 creatures and while rotating the camera view the map pop up might fill your screen as you are in the midst of battle thus obscuring your view Also Fable does tend to have some save problems You may complete some quests and save and upon reloading the quests may have to be recompleted or worse may not have been saved and will not be offered again Still these are rather minor complaints While Fable really doesn t live up to its advertising of being an all immersive RPG it is quite good and a blast to play if you like D D styled RPG s If you like Zelda games but wish they were more adult definitely check out Fable 
One of the few good RPG s out there When I first started playing fable I was amazed how much possibility there was to forge your own destiny Where one simple decision could alter your destiny for good or evil forever When you start out as a young boy who s village is burned plundered and the entire town murdered you feel sorry for the boy as his life has been taken from him From then on he is to become a hero As you embark on a long journey and make choices along the way you will forge you own personal destiny With a well written storyline to back it up this game amplifies your freedom to forge your destiny 
Awesome game I have the original for the DS lite I thought that was fun but this is better The first few chapters seem the same but the gameplay is better Twisting the bones is a new feature Repairing a compound fracture also new to me This game is good because it could really help shape you kids minds and let them explore a simulation to see is practicing medicine would be a job they would like BACK to the game I like that the NUNCHUK is the tool that lets you select your surgical instruments Having the patient displayed on a big screen is helpful too I do wish there was more talking though I thought they would upgrade that from DS but hey didn t It s not a waste of money It s like tetris in that you either love or hate it If you like it you won t be able to stop playing 
Keeps getting better As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle Crazy as it may sound Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox PlayStation 2 or the GameCube With that in mind it s not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn t really push the envelope terribly far The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year s game but for the most part it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current generation consoles is beginning to wind down However for at least this last year the veteran player outraces the up and comer in the Xbox 360 version and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year s game out on the older consoles Madden NFL 07 brings back practically every feature that was in Madden 06 On top of that a number of new gameplay upgrades have been brought to the table the majority of which are available in all versions of the game By themselves none of these individual changes or upgrades is particularly game changing but taken as a whole they add a nice dimension of depth These features include the highlight stick a new kick meter and lead blocking controls The highlight stick is a new version of the truck stick used for runners on offense Here you can use the right control stick to pull off the sorts of crazy jukes and steps that star running backs are so well known for and on top of that depending on the type of back you re playing you can opt to use more powerful moves or more finesse based maneuvers This feels like the natural evolution of last year s truck stick though most experienced Madden players will be able to get by just as easily using the button based moves rather than making liberal use of the stick But if you take the time to learn the stick and figure out how to use it and the button controls together you can be a very hard runner to stop The new lead blocking controls are likely to inspire some new tactics from all types of players Here while on offense you can opt to switch your controlled player to any of the available blockers during a running play This includes offensive linemen tight ends fullbacks or whoever else might be blocking on a play When blocking you can just do standard blocks or you can even get dirty and do some mean spirited cut blocks This is an interesting mechanic because it stops you from having to rely on CPU blockers which as any experienced player will tell you are not always the most reliable players on the field You can also quickly switch back to control the running back once you ve laid down your block which is good because the CPU running back doesn t always manage to find the holes you re creating At first you may find yourself unable to effectively use this feature as setting up the right blocks isn t always the most intuitive thing in the world But after some time this control method gives the running game a really interesting new perspective and those who love finding new strategies are bound to eat this up The new kick meter is probably the most accurate representation of kicking available in a game thus far With this meter you use the typical arrow to line up your angle and then press down on the right analog stick to set up your power The meter quickly fills up and then you press forward on the right stick to set the power as well as your accuracy The accuracy is based on the angle at which you press up If you press too far to the right or left the kick will get away from you If you land it within a set space it will go pretty much right where you want it to Beyond that the changes from 06 to 07 are mostly ancillary and fundamentally the game plays very much as its predecessor did On defense there are a few more available options in terms of positioning your defensive players and you can commit your defense in a certain direction the moment the ball is snapped On offense the quarterback vision cone which made its debut last year is still available though it s not a required feature You can just tap the right analog stick after snapping the ball and it will pop on letting you use it for a little accuracy boost No it s not any more fun to use than it was last year but that s not altogether surprising Otherwise pretty much every control feature you ve come to expect from Madden is front and center once again Potentially some people could play through Madden 07 and never really partake in the new running control features but there s definitely enough in all the available upgrades to add a significant layer of depth to the experience Even though Madden NFL 07 doesn t have any big game changing features to make it an especially memorable iteration of the series its roster of small but useful changes are ultimately more compelling than anything Madden 06 had on offer last year And while some people are undoubtedly over the notion of playing new games on old consoles Madden 07 shows that it can still deliver some enjoyable football regardless of what platform it s on It s not a big step forward and the similarities between this year and last year might be a tough sell for some But it s those similar aspects that Madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor and if you skipped out on 06 then there s no good reason to ignore 07 
It s Madden football nothing more There s a lot of different opinions of Madden NFL 07 swirling around so I figured I get in on it as well For my money to just have a new football game is worth it Seeing as how Madden is now the only football game available from year to year if you don t like Madden s brand of video games then I feel so sorry for you However I think this is a great installment By no means is this the best released but there s no doubt that it s a lot of fun Have Madden 06 You basically have 07 Not a lot has changed from last year The few things are the running options juking and whatnot being moved to the right joystick the 50 yard dash on the training camp and the new camera angle for your Superstar linebacker Also while I ve only played a quarter of an exhibition game and a lot of Superstar games I still have yet to hear John Madden I don t know if he s not on this game or not but if he isn t that just makes no sense Pros It s still Madden Linebacker view Overall Superstar Hall Of Fame feature Having all the big name rookies is kind of nice Cons It hasn t changed much from last year Yeah that s my only big complaint I can t help but love this game though If you re looking to save money then there s no huge reason to buy this unless you HAVE to play with Leinart Young Bush and Williams then by all means check this out However if not having those guys doesn t bother you then you really don t need this year s game 
Not the best Madden yet This years madden wasn t worth all this hype over I have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game Graphics are o k gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn t have the true madden gameplay as before It s just ok not super and semi dissapointing The things that caught me off guard was Vince Young and Reggie Bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right Overall i wasnt amazed Also the worst part is the new controls You need to use the right analog stick to juke spin and do shake n bake moves please agree with me people 
Karaoke on your schedule When I heard about this game at first I was stunned DDR and Guitar Hero are both games that focus on dance like and guitar like motions but they do not rely on the actual ability to dance or the actual ability to play guitar merely on combinations of responses through specialized controllers Karaoke Revolution however actually guages the accuracy of your singing Your performance is based on how closely to the original song you sing your version measured by pitch of the voice I would have expected as in the tradition of DDR and Guitar Hero that Karaoke Revolution would be simplified singing hitting certain buttons on a controller to produce certain singing notes on the screen But no this game uses a real microphone and your real voice The game also uses popular karaoke songs that are universally singable It may not be entirely of my genre of music that I would sing at a karaoke bar but almost all of the songs I have heard of and can make a passable attempt at singing and there is a wide spread across genres and across eras so that most genres are represented and there is both older and very modern music I have only used this game by myself to sing and practice songs for actual karaoke but I can imagine this game being incredibly fun with a party as well It uses the actual versions of the songs and is essentially like competitive karaoke And beyond that it also has a straightforward Karaoke feature that plays the karaoke versions of the songs complete with words for straight up karaoke for parties and such This game is one of several of this genre and I am personally looking forward to playing all of them My only critique is that there are limited numbers of songs and thus for me at least limited playing time If there was an on line version of this game that could access a much larger database of songs to play much like at a karaoke bar I would gladly pay a monthly fee to play such a game Let s hope such a thing is in the works 
This game is Fantabulous Of all the Karaoke games we have used this is by far the best It s fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters It has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have THere are the are different options like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score Hours of FUN FUN FUN 
Good For the price is a good deal i only use one card I have the other one for backup nice product good pric 
The must have Memory Card Pack The memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great No read errors VERY noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it 
good value for money I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card 
Best PS2 Memory Cards These are the best memory cards you can get for the PS2 Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 1PK Memory Card Rumors spread that non Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards 
I like them They re nice cards I never had a problem Since I had 3 PS2s in my house at the time we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine then my boyfriend bought me these and I always had my own memory cards no one else could say they were theirs or anything else The only problem I can think of is that they are a little expensive 
My daughter loves it My 9 year old daughter loves PS2 so buying the cards were worth the cost 
Memory Cards As you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same 
A Good Follow Up to a Fantastic Game Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic No matter how you look at it It was one of those games you either loved or hated Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square Enix to re release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2 The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original Despite what it looks like Valkyrie Profile 2 Silmeria is not a sequel to Valkyrie Profile but a prequel This means if you ve never played the first one fear not you aren t missing anything The story centers on Silmeria She s a Valkyrie trapped in the body of Princess Alicia Because of this it seems like Alicia has a split personality and that she s got to be crazy or something As a result Alice doesn t have very many friends if any at all Silmeria has been exiled by Odin the leader of the Gods She now wants revenge for what he has done to her and since Alice has no friends she agrees to help It s an interesting story but much like the first one gets off to a really slow start and takes a while to pick up The game s story is told through beautiful cinematics Not quite the best looking game on the PS2 but beautiful enough The backgrounds characters and monsters are all detailed Especially in some of the games cutscenes The voice acting is also suitable enough for the game The game also sounds really good The good news about Valkyrie Profile 2 is that there is no time limit Fans of the first will remember that there was a time limit before the battle at the end of the game Valkyrie Profile 2 does away with that and thank goodness it does This gives you far more time to explore and do everything the game has to offer and the dungeons are quite interesting Most Dungeons are pretty simple It sort of plays out in an action adventure style You have photons you can fire at your enemies and certain objects Your photon also reflects off some objects and it s actually vital to use this in some dungeons So the photon isn t just there it s essential Even more interesting in Valkyrie Profile is the battle system Battles are contact based In battle you ve got your characters on one side and your enemies on the other At first it seems like battles take place in real time but in reality the enemy only moves when you move This gives you more than enough time to plan out a strategy Each enemy has an attack zone If you re in it you ll be attacked In most RPGs getting attacked is no big deal In Valkyrie Profile 2 it s much more than just a big deal The difficulty of this game escalates really fast You ll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by some of your enemies Luckily there is a solution Most battles have a leader If you defeat the leader you win automatically without having to worry about defeating the others It helps if you want to end the battle quickly and especially helps when your party is being decimated Still the battle system calls for complete strategy on your part They say it takes about 40 hours to complete Valkyrie Profile 2 However you ll find yourself spending most of these hours leveling up to take on new challenges As I mentioned the difficulty level rises fast Meaning you ll probably do a lot of battling in a dungeon before moving on to the next Even worse you ll have to backtrack out of a dungeon once you complete it Even worse than that enemies respawn when you reenter a room The good thing about this at least is that the dungeons aren t overly long Again however you ll spend quite some time leveling up In addition to inside battle outside battle is just as interesting in dungeons You ll often come across sealstones When you pick them up they grant enhancements to your party They can be either positive or negative For example your strength could go up by grabbing one and go down by grabbing another Carrying it puts the effect on your party However you can also put the effect on your enemies by setting the stone on a dais Needless to say you ll want to put the negative effects on your enemies unless you re looking for a harder challenge than the game already is Outside of dungeons and battles you can learn plenty of skills throughout the game When you buy equipment you can link it together to give your characters special skills This is a lot of fun to play around with Although it should be said it gets tedious to set it up after a while The game shows you which skills you ve created through your equipment but there s no way for it to auto equip with the stuff that gives you that skill At first this is no problem but then as your characters start to build up and your list gets longer it becomes a pain to set up all these skills again It comes down to way too much time in the menu when there shouldn t have to be Valkyrie Profile 2 is overall a pretty satisfying game If you can get past the sluggish story which really does turn out to be really good in the end then you ll find yourself in love with this game It s different from the first one but not so much that old fans will find themselves disappointed Actually it s quite the opposite If you liked the first game then by all means pick up this one The Good +An interesting story +Beautiful graphics +Excellent music score +Good voice acting +Large cast of playable characters +Interesting skill system +Just all out fun to play The Bad The story is slow Really steep difficulty level a lot of the game will no doubt come from you spending time leveling up in dungeons before moving on The skill system is interesting but not being able to have your equipment auto equip is really annoying when you ve got a lot of characters and a lot of items in your inventory equipping your characters shouldn t be a tedious chor 
A MUST Play for RPG fans PS2 is far from dead Square Enix has done it again First off I am going to say I love this game I m a big turn based stategy RPG fan But I would say this gamefs battle system is semi real time with strategy elements and I love it I would have to compare the battle system to the likes of Parasite eve and Vagrant Story With the same elements still present from the original Valkyrie Profile This is probably the best RPG I have played all year I strongly recommend this game to any RPG fan and will definitely satisfy until FFXII Now for the review Graphics 5 out 0f 5 Simply amazing I knew the old PS2 still had it in her This game has some of the best graphics you are going to see on the PS2 you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it The detail in the characters background and dungeons are amazing I really get taken back to Vagrant story when I play this game And OMG the special attacks look ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Perform a special attack and your jaw will drop I canft say anything negative about the graphics in this game what so ever especially being last generation Sound 4 5 out 5 The game sounds great The voice over are well done Battle cries are wonderful and will take you back to the original Valkyrie Profile unless of course you purchased it on the PSP then it wont take you back very farcLOL Controls 5 out of 5 Okay I donft thing I have played an RPG with better controls You play on a 2D screen side scrolling with outward and inward exits and entrances press up or down accordingly to access them Anyone who has played the first one knows exactly how it works The first new thing you will notice is the new battle control scheme The old is you still have to press X O or to correspond to the character you have assigned to that button still works great The new is that now you are able to roam in 3D once you are in battle mode and this works great I explain in the Gameplay section L2 lets you find and switch targets and then you just analog to get there Gameplay 5 out of 5 Dare I say umm perfect First I will address the two things I loved about the original Valkyrie Profile that you will find in this sequel prequel 1st thing I began to get really annoyed by RPGfs now a days that make you have to talk to nearly every single person in a town to move the story along This is never a worry in the Valkyrie Profile series You go to a town if there is something of importance there CG or AI takes over all you have to do is listen read and then go shopping or if you really want talk to the limited amount of people in that town but it is normally just random talk nothing of real importance to the story Or you may have to talk to some people to fnd side quest maybe Many of the RPGfs I have tried to play lately suffered from thiscI mean who has the time to sit and play a game for hours only to be left feeling like you barely accomplished anything cause you couldnft find the right person to move the story along 2nd thing is the battle system being able to press a certain button numerous times and watch that character spring in to action was always a joy Lets you feel more involved in battle instead of just letting you sitting and watching The new additions are GREAT additionscfirst the free roaming in battle You can move anywhere on the 3D battle screen you want within the parameters of course Since you are able move anywhere on the battle screen Square Enix thought it would be a good idea to allow you to split up your party and they were right Basically you have a party of 4 but you can split them up into 2 teams Imagine this if you willcyou send one team to either fight a separate group of enemies or you can send one group to draw attention and use the other group to attack from behind taking the enemy by surprise and normally causing more damage Strategy has been added Other notable mentions Special attacks are Stellar Enemy Bosses are huge and characters are very likable Also while in a dungeon you can still turn foes to crystal and use them to aide you in reaching different areas but dig this Now you can turn a foe to crystal then shoot that foe a second time to transport yourself to its position Ex You see an enemy on the ledge in front above you but you cannot reach him or the ledge by simply jumping So you shoot diagonally at him freeze him shoot a second time and you are immediately transported to his position on the ledge and he is transported to your old position How cool is that Story So Far 4 out of 5 the story so far is great and from what I can tell takes place before the original Valkyrie Profile I am only about 40 in to it but so far I am really drawn in to it I cant go in to more detail for the sake of spoiling it but it is intriguing Bottom Line If you are an RPG fan you MUST have this title in your library of games it will not disappoint With the combination of the GREAT original gameplay stellar graphics intriguing story and innovative new features this is one not to be missed Even if you are not an RPG fan I would still recommend this as a rental 
A good follow up to the original I have now played VP2 for a few days now and I have to say that I like it It has its problems but overall it is a very fun game VP2 takes place 100 or so years before the original VP I won t spoil any of the plot except to say that many of the ruins visited in the original game appear as beautiful cities in VP2 and one gets the sense that we will see why these cities became ruins in the course of the game Graphically the game is beautiful The movies are nice if stiff at times and the sound is great Mechanically however there are some issues VP2 attempts to keep the essence of the battle system from the original intact while adding a 3 D wrinkle Unfortunately the controls are so gummy at times that you will be frustrated as often as you are pleased by the results of the new system All in all though the game is excellent I drop it a star because of control issues 
Lives up to the original and pretty to boot Beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the Valkyrie Epic The storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists Valkyrie Profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the PS2 making it a must buy On a personal note this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so I highly recommend playing VP1 through before starting VP2 
Great Game I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok 
Yea After my little brother lost my original copy I had to buy a new one and I am so glad I did I love the game and it was so much fun to play Like all Final Fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay 
actually pretty simple If you liked final fantasy 3 you ll like this game You ll play some then learn some more of the story 
Final Fantasy VIII is underrated It s better than Final Fantasy VII I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII From the introductory movie I was hooked The world and story were very unique as well as the new battle system I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it I loved it more than the materia system of VII The characters in VIII were all very likeable It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the Final Fantasy series The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments From start to finish I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general 
Fun but short I liked this game especially with Kris Kristofferson doing Ned s voice Should have had more of him in it Gameplay is short I beat it in less than a day I liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this 
It s over already I m going to keep this short because the game doesn t deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and SHORT my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it 
Only Way To Go Just Great All around nice work from Microsoft and their newly launched Marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers Xbox Live really is a great gaming experience 
excellent I d recommend this to anyone who has or ever will play a video game in their life I also recommend it to those that never will It s just plain awesome 
Xbox 360 is great I love the xbox 360 I got it about 2 months ago I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3 i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun The graphics and sound are great to I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference you need real cables people dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug The wireless controllers are great the main thing are games theres good ones and bad ones choose very wisely But there alot of good ones right now to choose from And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive theres no other way to have it 
Katamari love Our whole family plays this game We fell in love with the first Katamari game but it was frustrating trying to complete each subsequently harder level This game isn t like that Each level is different in its own right Some levels require you to roll faster some bigger some of them you have to gather as many of a certain item as you can find It is challenging without the frustration You can always go back and try to do better on each level find the cousin or the present that is hidden or you can continue on There is a two player mode also It s much more fun than the first Katamari Of course if you don t know the premise of the first game you might not understand the king s and the common peoples rantings but it s simple enough Roll around and get big with your sticky ball It s addictive 
Better than the First We Love Katamari does not have the wonderful music that the first game had but the levels have improved astronomically This game plays just like the first but there are even more things to find and more creativity with gameplay Every level has one present to find and one to four cousins to capture each We Love Katamari definitely makes Katamari Damacy seem repetitious How is this so Well mindless rolling will no longer get you the best score For example one level you have to make a katamari as big as you can with only 50 objects which is quite a difficult task in such a large area Another level that requires some serious searching is the money level In this level you pick up things to make more money not increase the size of the Katamari in meters Finding expensive jewelry early and other pricy objects is key to making a ton of cash There are many other interesting levels in this game but I think it d be best to leave them as a surprise Regarding the complaints about the short length of the game this is far from the truth The game is easier to beat than the first but it is still just as hard to make gigantic planets I ve spent hours trying to do my very best with each level I never got bored since most levels are very unique I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age My five year old nieces and nephews could not stop playing this game when they came over 
This game rocks It feels so strange describing this game to people who have never heard of it before Yeah you play as this tiny little prince and your father the King of All Cosmos got drunk one night and destroyed all the stars in the sky Your job is to go around the earth with this psychedelic sticky thing called a katamari and roll stuff up into a big ball Really that s all you do just roll as much stuff as possible into a massive ball and if it s big enough your gigantic well endowed father will shoot it up into the sky to become a new star And uh that s the plot WTF Yeah you just gotta play it And that s the best advice I can give What exactly is it that attracts me to such a bizarre game Perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion of mine to just roll things up into a ball I dunno it s just plain fun The controls are very simple you only use the left and right analog sticks to navigate through your brightly colored exceedingly cluttered environment What really adds to the enjoyment of this game is the sound Every object you pick up lets out a unique sound as it s unapologetically absorbed into your ball of junk and it s quite amusing Furthermore the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat and you re sure to get the songs stuck in your head for hours days weeks months lol I also love the fact that this title is enjoyable and playable for both gamers and non gamers alike The controls are quick to pick up and simple objective is easy to jump into Truly this game is just off the wall fun and if you re willing to try something unique with a healthy dose of craziness give this game a roll 
My two cents rolled up into a Katamari This is another praise for the game rolled into the other praises By now you ve read the synopsis by others your character the Prince or one of his cousins rolls an orb i e Katamari which collects every object in the level This game works on many levels it is first and foremost absurd and bewildering The introductory animations and cut scenes are off the wall yet amusing The incessant rolling is cathartic and addictive the bonuses involve finding hidden presents and cousins in the level There are many variations on the rolling theme in the game roll a sumo wrestler into food roll a snowball onto a snowman roll fireflies into a kid s reading light time trials etc but the most satisfying is the original premise of rolling everything and anything into as large a ball as possible Once you start to consume people trucks skyscrapers ships clouds etc then you feel very powerful Music is very catchy something vacant from many video games My only criticism the cooperative two player mode can venture into frustration quite easily My wife and I played who are both good at the game but you often find yourself awkwardly and slowing moving where you want And that s part of the problem where you want to roll may not be where the other person wants to roll so communicate well 
Best Headset To Date This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis 
REMINDER this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you d be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks Chris 
mech assault this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great 
Lots of fun This was a top notch game I really enjoyed playing it It was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter The good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time I was If you ve already played Halo and you re looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one 
Mass Destruction O Yeah Baby MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again No Not if you have Xbox Live In Live you can play Capture The Flag download new Mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more If you don t have Xbox Live or a system link that your wasting your money 
Doom 3 very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i couldn t stop playing it 
A very scary first person shooter Doom 3 is scary you literally spend most of the game in the dark and nightmarish creatures can come out of nowhere and try to kill you The environments look great and so does the character models The game is long but can be longer if you get lost However this game has a few flaws One and it s a big one is that you have to always carry the flashlight around because most FPS only have the character have one weapon on one hand at a time and have the other hand to be non existent you constently have to switch between the flashlight and a weapon So when it s dark and you have to fight you have to either hold a flashlight and keep whacking your opponent until it s dead or stay in the dark and shoot your enemy which you can have a hard time finding it the second con is that unlike Half Life 2 you can t really interact with much you can t grab certain objects and drop them or throw them And a final con which comes to one word Imps these are the most annoying enemy in the game you constently fight them and it can get annoying sometimes otherwise a game to get 
Scariest First Person Shooter This is one awesome game play it online or against the computer I do suggest online for more fun in the long run if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume definetely the scariest first person shooter out there 
Blinx is great Blinx can be very time consuming for us older xBox players whom didn t grow up with a controller in our hands I found Blinx to be fun entertaining and challenging Even though it is rated for younger children I think the strategy involved is for older children teenagers and some of us adults For anyone wishing to have some fun have to think a bit Blinx is for you 
Awesome pack for the price Let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about CompDude being off track The keys are in there I found all four of these games to be great I haven t gotten into the LOTR one yet because it s graphics intensive and I have a laptop The other three games are cool too For the price it s a great deal compare to buying the titles individually 
Great value for the price I ordered this set primarily for LOTR Return of the King but after I got it it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it But I was able to play the other three games and I really enjoyed Freedom Fighters and Medal of Honor Black and White was okay but I wasn t able to get into it But it should be noted that with Black and White you get both the original game and the expansion pack Creature Isle So you are really getting five games instead of four So I highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good but not so modern games and spend little money 
Don t listen to the nay sayers I can only assume that the handful of people rating this game with one star out of five are GTA fanboys or total curmudgeons Forget comparisons with GTA Yes some of the open world gameplay elements are familiar But this is basically a Tony Montana Simulator and THAT S the very considerable USP of the game It s all about What Would Tony Do The conversations are hilarious the gunplay is great the vehicle physics are solid the drug wars game adds an extra layer of strategy and some interesting choices Sure there are some periods where game events hit a bit of a lull but most other games GTA in particular are guilty of this And at its best this game is an absolute blast Aside from the decent core mechanics the game will MAKE YOU LAUGH constantly which is no small consideration it s consistently entertaining even when you re NOT busy with a mission and you can t ask for much more than that 
Excite Truck is next gen gaming material I have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w the game I liked the stage where you can get on to the Great Wall of China I think thats what it is And my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8 10 He said it could go up if he played more The controls are so easy and fun I highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii 
Really fun A lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good but it is my favorite game to play on the Wii Doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun And you get bonus points for ramming your opponents If it were only like that on real roads 
A really FUN game my favorite so far I picked this up along with Zelda when buying the Wii This game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is SO FUN I love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road The action is fast and the driving is very intuitive provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts It s not too hard anyone can play and it s just fun I love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me Highly Recommended don t overlook this game 
Brilliant Use of the New Wii First off this game s graphics are not mind blowing They are very good but they are not as beautiful as the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3 That said that is not the reason that you buy this game The game has amazing replayability because of it s amazing controls and fun factor You turn the Wii remote on its side and use it as a steering wheel When on a massive jump use the steering wheel to change your pitch and land safely Perfect landings are met with speed boosts Playing this game with friends is a blast Your friends will be wowed by the controls and then wowed by the fun they re having I have played several of the Wii games already and this is my favorite Must buy 
A really really really fun game Bully isn t a game for kids I mean since it s a bad example for them I mean you can cause trouble in school by throwing stink bombs or eggs at people Plus you get missions like having to steal panties from the girls dorm for the gym teacher lol It also doesn t teach you to go by school rules Infact you get many missions to break school rules As someone old enough to not to do what I see on the game though it s a blast I mean I thought it was a game where you are in school the whole time But no you can even get out to town eventually and even have missions there The school stuff is fun but you can get tired of only being there I also like how the game is seasonal and how it s Halloween on one part and Christmas on another part Without doing the missions you just have class or can flirt with girls or start random fights or pick locks to lockers Plus you can start fights with those hallway geeks who chase you around if you are even a second late for class They then bring you to class if they catch you With all the Grand Theft Auto games basically all seeming exactly the same despite different missions it s nice to see a fresh game from Rock Star Games I wouldn t recommed this to any parent to pick up for their kid though Well unless they are in their 20 s lol and mature enough to not do what they see in the game 
Bully ROX After the incredible Monkey Island series was halted I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines entertaining dialogue and lush scenery Then Bully came along and I was hooked This really is a great game and you shouldn t be set against it because it s really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto There s no blood no sexuality except for kissing and there s so many involving and engrossing storylines The characters are also some of the best I ve ever seen each having their own stories and personality The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school GET BULLY IT S AN AWESOME GAME People who like this game should also look at the Monkey Island series of games for PC and PS2 and the Nancy Drew series for PC 
GTA meets Harry Potter I just received this game yesterday and I ve already put a few hours worth of time into it You can t help but notice the Rockstar trademark graphics and intro Although the controls and character movements I think have improved over the San Andreas controls and movement I found it challenging to balance the time in this game The clock moves pretty fast and you have to run around finding challenges as well as watching the clock to make sure you aren t truant from class or trespassing at night when you re supposed to be in bed You also have to really watch out for the Prefects which by the way is the same term used in Harry Potter Maybe it s a British thing I have to disagree with the one reviewer saying that Jimmy is not a Bully He isn t like the other bullies but he does have to win the respect of others GTA style by protecting and beating up the Bullies So basically Jimmy bullies the bullies Breaking into lockers running errands for the underpriveleged flirting with girls getting good grades in class riding around on a skateboard and one of my favorites is Dodgeball in Gym Class And these are all things I ve come across in the first few hours of play What s next Get this game It s a vast array of ecleptic gaming skills and entertainment styles you won t regret it And if you are also looking for a completely original game graphics like I ve never seen before I noticed alot of Bully buyers get Okami which I did also and that is like no other game graphics wise VERY artistic for those who s girlfriends get tired of watching you play the same ol It is pleasing to the eye Very artistic and original 
Rant N Rave Well after all the media attention Bully has arrived It would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again May be now they ll focus on some real problems facing our poor children Not only did this game prove not to be a Columbine handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens Well the rant is over now for the rave The game mechanics are excellent Like many of Rockstar titles they ve improved on the GTA engine allowing smoother play Stepping away from the mission types in the GTA series Bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the GTA typical T A wholesale killing Now don t get me wrong I enjoy the GTA series and most of Rockstar s other releases I never passed shop class though Seeing the GTA open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation The mini games are fun and addictive I wish they would have other classes represented With Bully you get to not only play a great game but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time Overall this is an excellent game worth your time and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be 
Take That I was a little late to the booming cult following that Phoenix Wright has acquired having just bought the game this month However it did not dissapoint I was always a fan of the point and click adventures on the PC but was dissapointed with Trace Memory not so much that it was a bad game but it was soo short I was hesitant to spend the money again on a game I could beat in about 10 hours time but luckily I did Phoenix Wright is one of those games that has enough challenge to it that you don t feel like you are breezing effortlessly through it yet is open enough for younger players to be able to play and enjoy it as well The length of the game is fairly long with five cases to solve each one becoming longer and more difficult as you play I must say you really get into the characters in this game as each case is connected in some way to the others and I really liked the last case that added the use of luminol and finger printing tools makes you feel all CSI and stuff I look forward to the second one coming out soon and definately recommend this as one of the best on the DS right now 
There should be more games like this for the DS I finally got a DS and one of the first older games I tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was Phoenix Wright I ve been Jonesing for this game for awhile now It s unique and entertaining The choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it s too much fun to not love this title This is the type of game that makes the DS so unique and proud to say that I own this system More games should take note and follow in it s footsteps This is a must buy for any DS library Other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are Trauma Center and Trace Memory This system was made for these types of games These games are why I will always trust in Nintendo for high quality and interesting games Game on 
An Ace for Phoenix Wright One of the best DS games I ever had It does not take to be a lawyer to get fully satisfied with this game Although this is a heavily text based game I mean really heavy you won t get tired of reading the storylines and following the details I know you won t find this in any stores nowadays so try to order here at Amazon This game s one of the best 
Original fun I ordered this game based on reviews alone It s great Will not disappoint The only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected Other than that a great game Hope to see a sequel 
Anime law and order meets adventure puzzler The hilarity adventure wit and fun of this game is nothing shy of stupendous amazing great marvelous It has a certain nostaglia to it with a new twist on the adventure puzzle genre Think of all the games that consumed our time back in the day such as King s quest Police Quest and Leisure Suit Larry and put it to the tune of trials evidence and investigation with hints of an RPG text adventure and anime and you ll land on Phoenix Wright It s concept does seem retro but it really is like nothing you have played before The star of this show is Phoenix Wright a lawyer who is new to the scene and must prove is worth with the Fey Co law offices As his first case you must take on a murder case as the defendant s lawyer In court you will have prove to the court that the defendant is not quilty by cross examining witness testimonies Your object is to find faults and contradictions in their testimony by referencing evidence and prior statements You can press them on everything they say to make them open up more about their testimony or to get them to confess more information The game doesn t stop there though after winning your first case you will go on to also investigate the crime scenes talk to witnesses and find your own evidence for your next case Think law and order but you will be handling both sides of the coin Sure there is a detective but he is a bit slow witted and quick to come to mis conclusions That is where you come in to further investigate all the missing gaps that the detective doesn t fill to use finding in the investigation to prove your defendant innocent later in court and to provide the court clarity as to what actually happened It plays like a puzzle adventure in that you must find clues and evidence and present them at the correct times to object to a testimony prove a contradiction or to trigger an event in a investigation in order to progress through the game These items are stored in your court record This game plays more like a interactive comic book and that is definitely not a bad thing Most of your time will be spent reading text I would say this takes up 75 of the game This doesn t hurt the game s score any because for 1 the game has a great story and is intriguing around every corner 2 the interaction between the characters is oft times funny and not at all dry It reads like a quality script written for a comic book or tv show The following 25 is interaction the ability to choose the right option or to present evidence at the right moment of the game This interaction goes seamless with the story and fits appropriately with the DS As the stylus is greatly utilized for presenting evidence out of your court record and exploring crime scenes There is a good reason why this makes most people s top ten DS list Graphics 3 5 out of 5 Although this game only consist of anime esque stylings of still life characters that are only slightly animated amongst static backgrounds the graphics still help carry the story It looks like the makings of slightly animated interactive comic book The character art is well drawn and each character changes looped animations based on their current mood However the graphics could easily have been shown on a lesser system such as the GBA Perhaps the graphics have been revamped and enhanced slightly for the DS version The only real thing that separates it from a GBA title is its use of stylus and its length Sound 4 out 5 good use of sound effects and use of music add suspense and drama to the game Gameplay 5 Story 5 Replay Value 3 Overall 4 5 A must for DS owners 
Good is a sonym its the original Nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price 
PS2 controller Ok I ve had this controller for 3 years and nothing happend to it It has fallen maney times and nothing happend Some kid wrote that it s a rip off for 24 bucks Well thats the best deal you ll get IT s way better than the stupid bulky xbox controllers xbox may have better grathics but the games stink and xbox s can catch on fire 
Sims2 Overall rating The continuation of the Sims2 game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack The smaller expansions in between the big ones ie Glamour life stuff and or Holiday mini pack are good in my book because I get tired of the same decor and clothing after a while It s nice to get fresh things Although EA could just bundle those small expansions in with one of the bigger ones like Sims2 Nightlife or Sims2 Pets for examples Regardless I still love the Sims2 and I look forward to more enhancements in the future 
Very interesting This is a very interesting game Lots of places to explore Game Play is pretty smooth Sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot The game is very bookish With no cut scenes from the movie It can be fairly complicated at times With some strange moves to master Like flying shoes and umbrellas It s a fun game with good graphics 
Xbox Version is better The Xbox version of this game is way better For one the graphics are enhanced not crappy like the PS2 version And second of all loading time and processing time is is literally cut in half SO DONT BUY THIS VERSION SUCK IT UP AND BUY AN XBOX oh and if this game bores you you either weren t using cheats or u havent played the missions atleast through los santos 
Most real time entertaining game to hit PS2 This game has been out for a while And I have been playing it for a long time now Have I ever had a boring moment while playing GTA SA No I honestly have cherished every moment of gameplay Why Because this game has so much content and capability that it is not possible to dislike this game if you have actually sat down to play and appreciate it People giving GTA SA low ratings must be joking CONTROL Superb When I want my character to do something he does it no questions asked If I want to fire a gun at an enemy I get to fire the gun without having to put up with errors or jams If I want to hop in a car and take off I get to do just that CONTENT This game is a vast improvement over even GTA III There is so much to do that it is impossible to ever get bored Every second is entertaining there is always something to work on and or improve Challenging missions are everywhere and if you don t want to do missions you can go lift weights build up your muscles or you can go put some neat features colors on your personal cars RADIO Good stations that have songs that cover just about any genre GRAPHICS Of course there is always room to make graphics better but the graphics on this game were very good despite there being so much on the disk This game covers everything and there is never really a let down If you haven t bought played this game I suggest that you do It is worth every penny and will keep you entertained for accumulated weeks at a time Good luck 
Still the champ As far as football games go over the last 3 or 4 years NCAA football has been the best This year so far is no different I got the Madden and haven t even started the season yet because it comes out so early none of the rosters are anywhere near close I play with the Cowboys and had to create 8 players Also the gameplay for Madden is so unrealistic a linebacker can intercept everything To me since about 2003 NCAA has looked better and played much better than Madden The players on Madden look so little for some reason You can control your players alot easier on NCAA The trick to the momentum meter on this game is to try to get a good lead early and after that it is alot easier One thing I dont like about this game is that for the past 2 years they have taken off the special intro s to add all that other junk See i play with Miami and they always run thru smoke at the beginning but they took it out 2 years ago why Also they used to show Notre Dame walk down their stairs but they took that off too Also for the last 2 years I havent won the heisman even though I had better stats Other than that the game is solid haven t played the Superstar mode yet For football fans this game is worth a buy 
A GREAT GAME BUT NOTHING IMPROVED Basically if you like 04 05 And 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics I Like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it Remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it This is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge 
A Barnburner from College Football Fans I ve been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now and here are my thoughts 1 The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it s sport as any other game Anyone who has been to a big time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake 2 I did not play the career mode I simply prefer control over the whole program 3 Gameplay is very strong anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls 4 I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks 5 Likewise I could do without the auto slo motion on key plays It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play EA that s what replay is for 6 The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties not just on TD s but simple catches or defensive plays 7 You now have more control over recruiting with in season recruiting including mulitple pitches and on campus visits 8 After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables Changing the logo or the sponsor does not a new unlockable make 
Fun Video Game Art No other game looks or plays like this The missions and locations are varied and colorful The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials And as usual Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating Lots of unlockables offer high replay This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru The story is straightforward and engaging Lots of really interesting concepts machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole dead eye thing and it controls very well Another great game from an outstanding company Hopefully a sequel is in the works 
mind blowing limb losing seriosly a guy loses an arm action im a western fanatic i just love the wild west I try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is AWESOME i cant wait for the new western game GUN coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying 
never been done this good ever this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta grand theft auto series graphics 9 10 sound 8 10 gameplay 7 5 10 overall 8 3 who ever does nt have it get it is the best western game ever 
Really Fun Game Very good stealth type game This game is really addicting and keeps you playing Its a really intense game and gets harder level by level One of them games where it makes you think you gotta think what your next move should be Like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it should you take them out Or sneak past them Alot of stuff like that Hands down a really fun game 
A fun but somewhat buggy game This is a pretty decent looking Diablo style RPG game that adds another chapter to the game Sacred In Underworld you explore more areas farther north in the world of Ancaria I found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore rather difficult and a little confusing but there are interesting new quests and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters the Dwarf and Demoness The original Sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the Underworld epansion pack 
Sacred underworld delivers I bought this after it had been out a year so not as much available on line as there was a year ago also it is a German game so limited USA playing But I loved the first Sacred I also loved Sacred underworld if you don t plan on on line playing Sacred is worth the money 
Sacred Underworld More of same but bettter As the title suggests Sacred Underworld is pretty much the same as Sacred but a little better So if you like Sacred Sacred Underworld is very well worth playing 
Good stuff As far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive Some can be had for 40 50 at other sites BUT those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space This adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that It connects to the back of the console and HD DVD drive if you purchase that and use the power of the 360 It doesn t take up any extra space and has a strong connection I would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home 
Wireless is the way to go My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection so while I wasn t thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter I have to say it was completely worth it Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360 I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn t known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together At first the 360 would access Xbox Live but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router I live in center city Philadelphia and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available The range must be good because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code I think it is a WEP number I was able to punch the router s ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home I have never had a single issue since I don t think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone s fault but my own since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others All in all I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years This adapter works great is small and disappears behind the console reduces the clutter of wires and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area It was definitely a worthy purchase 
Easy set up works pretty well two floors away Overall I am pretty happy with this unit My only complaint is it is a little underpowered as far as grabbing my router signal My laptop has 5 bars in the basement but I can typically only get two on the Xbox 360 with this adapter Because of this it does drop its signal occasional with my Linksys WRT54GS Router However it is also about 50 ft away assuming a direct line with two floors and several walls in the way Still using this unit was much better than figuring out how to hardwire my Xbox from two floors away Setup was a breeze I plugged it in it snaps nicely into the back of the 360 and plugs into the nearby USB using a short cord went to the network setting on the 360 selected the wireless slot found my network and typed in my WPA key for my router Done It took all of 5 minutes start to finish Until buying this I just dragged a 100 ethernet cable down the steps and through doorways anytime I wanted to connect to XBox Live What a pain This is not a perfect solution if you have a lot of space and stuff between your router and Xbox 360 but is fine for my needs which mostly includes downloading from XBox Marketplace and occasional online play If you are an avid XBox Live player and you setup is like mine you might want to consider a hardwire solution You may ocassionally lose your signal in the middle of a game 
Easy Setup All I had to do was plug it into the console and bring up XBox Live and it connected The only thing I did not like is that I would have preferred an Ethernet connection in lieu of the USB connection Other than that the product worked as intended 
Preaching to the choir Well I must say after purchasing the Linksys WGA11B Wireless B Game Adapter that while yes this adapter is overpriced it does work and considering that I only got the Linksys adapter to work once and then it shut down in the middle of an update I must say the price looked worth it I can t vouch for your financial situations but after speading nearly 3 days trying to set up the Linksys when my wife finally said I should get this instead this hooked up and connected instantly No problems and I guess for the price it does look nice hooked in to the back of the Xbox So you may not have as many problems as I do with the Linksys but if you have any questions or limited computer networking ability this will be worth the price only because nothing simplier does exist So I would recommend this product if you want true plug and play which I don t believe the Linksys to be I m sure plently of people are happy with the Linksys it just didn t work for me So think first to avoid paying for both I would go back and never buy the Linksys if I could 
Great Game When I first heard of this game I basically ignored it Then when I was visiting Gamestop one day I decided to buy it I was instantly amazed by the unique battle system the bright and cheerful backdrops except for Twilight Town that is and the challenging and profound gameplay I have not played the first one but I will probably get it from the virtual console on Wii One problem with the game is that it s too short 
A worthwhile game for all that have a game cube Paper Mario The thousand year door is an awesome game One time I played it for 4 hours straight but your probubly wondering about the game not me Well first of all I would say this is a very creative game for everyone The music and replay value arent to good but it is definantly made up by the awesome gameplay graphics characters and story It made me laugh a few times and it was GREAT FUN when you first play it all the way through The way it does battling is similar to pokemon but a bit more complicated but it is really fun I realy like the punies and TEC the computer and yoshie The bad guys are the X nauts and I beat the crud out of them for what they did to TEC As always I highly recomend this game to anyone with a gamecube for someone who wants a pretty long and a bit of a challenging game 
Great Fun I ve been playing Mario games since the original debut on the NES and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game The RPG style is a great offshoot for the Mario franchise The dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30+ hours I spent playing the game were well worth it There s a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find I will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes Most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over 
Mario Playing Granny I am an old lady trying to play a kids game I aprreciate the fact that this game explains the moves to me very clearly I have enjoyed playing it and so have my grandchildren I am very glad I purchased it 
Paper Mario 2 great for casual entertainment I bought Paper Mario 2 for my neice to play when she comes over to visit now she comes over to play the game It has an interesting story line and many characters to interact with The puzzles are only moderatly hard so she hasn t gotten stuck and lost interest but the story is long enough that we haven t just breezed through it either It s better if you take so side trips to work the missions and fight in the arena where you can build up your levels faster You can also revisit previous lands and re fight the random encounters The only drawback to the game play is the long cut screens that you have to read The game flow would be better if there was an option to read these to you like Super Monkey Ball 2 I know I know educational aspect of reading yourself but that s her parents job not mine Game masters will find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck for long periods of time on puzzles then Parper Mario 2 will work for you Well worth the 20 pric 
Entertaining game It is a fun first person shooter game The graphics are decent and the story line s ok The game s play time is about 15 20 hours 
It Couldn t be Better For the First Game I LOVE this game The storyline is wonderful I guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs But what I LOVE is playing multiplayer And someone did bash the multiplayer but there are TONS of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates I ve had this game for years and I never get tired of playing online Actually it s kind of addicting 
Great game This game is really good I have a real up to date computer so everything runs fast and smooth The multiplayer is great You can play 1 000 s of people in a huge number of maps and game styles You can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear One of the down points is that in multilayer someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing Another thing would be the lag This is where the game moves real choppy or you lose the network connection Still its a really fun game 
Really fun until you beat it I m 15 and I have Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2 Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 this game and I m getting LEGO Star Wars in the mail any day now I really like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 1 but this is a game that is hard to place as to how much I like it I got this game 2 days ago after work at like 2 PM and I played it until like 1 AM and then I woke up the next day at about 9 AM and I beat it at maybe 1 PM So it took me about half a day to beat I was really mad when I beat it because I was having fun and it just suddenly ended And it was a really stupid ending too The Good You have a really good control over your squad with a variety of different orders such as telling a squad mate to set up a sniping position in one spot or telling your slicer to slice open a door for you This is good so that you dont have to do everything yourself and you dont have to rely on your squad to give you covering fire when it takes a whole minute to slice into a computer data base The weapons are pretty sweet and they are ones that you have never really seen before except for maybe thermal detonators or a wookie bowcaster If you become incapacitated you can tell your squad to come revive you or if you don t feel like fighting tell them to just maintain their current orders and revive you after the fighting is done The way to heal yourself is a bacta station which I think is better than running over a health container The AI is good so your squad actually knows how to fight The Bad The game is a lot shorter than I expected with only about 3 different planets ships There are only about 5 different enemies Battle droids Super Battle droids Trandoshans Geonosians and Magna Guards The enemies all act the same in every battle Super Battle droids are really annoying in a fight because they are really tough to beat if you just have a blaster rife unless you re a noob and play it on easy Telling your squad to do things gets repetative after a while The ending sucks Once you beat it you can only play the game over on a harder setting which is not really that fun or play with your friends on multiplayers which isn t fun either So you just put it back on the shelf for a while until you re bored and feel like playing it again So all in all this is a really fun game until you beat it So I suggest that you pace yourself 
Almost just like Halo This game is pretty cool u are in a 4 man squad made up of you the Leader Orange Scorch the demoshing guy yellow Fixer the guy who hacks into stuff green and Sev the sniper red I in this game it basicly is the battle of geonsis and wht happens from there to eposode 3 And amazingly it is almost just like halo Ad in some parts has more blood to it like when you stab a alien with your knife the blood shoots on your visor yes this game has more than robots anyhow this game is becoming out dated so by it here you ll love it 
Clone Wars at it s best This game is amazing Unlike so many other star wars games this is a first person shooter which is a great touch to the star wars universe I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons you have attachments to one gun The attachments are sniper and rocket launcher The single player campaign is outstanding though the multiplayer is so so This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title 
the first game i ever beat this game is very good it jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don 
The PS2 might sell more but its limitations hurt this version of Max Payne While the PS2 version is not really bad it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the Xbox and PC The PS2 s sound and music to Max Payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on The gameplay is still good even though some areas are cut off do to the PS2 s limitations but that doesn t hurt the gameplay too much Graphics are also very scratchy and so are the characters even though all the versions of Max Payne don t have great character models the PS2 version looks even more out of order But the controls are better for PS2 the smaller controller the PS2 has really helps compared the Xbox controller and a keyboard Still highly enjoyable the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence If you can t get your hands on any other version then the PS2 is perfect for you 
Excellent Game Excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales Es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar 
What did you expect Its Gran Turismo theres really nothing more to say I own all the titles in this franchise and I have never been disappointed with any one of em The series is really amazing With every new release it only gets better People should also try Tourist Trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing 
AMAZING THIS IS THE MOST COMPLETE AND MOST INTERESTING RACING GAME EVER DEVELOPED IN THE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES THE BEST GRAPHICS THE MOST CARS THE PRECISE HANDLING AND DID I MENTION THE GRAPHICS WOW THIS IS AMAZING PLAYING THIS GAME MAKES ME WONDER WHAT WOULD THE NEXT ONE WILL LOOK LIKE HOW CAN SONY MAKE ANYTHING THAT S BETTER THAN THIS IT IS ALREADY THE BEST RACING GAME IN THE WORLD IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING NO OTHER GAME COULD EVER COME CLOSE GRAN TURISMO HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMMITATED BUT NEVER DUPLICATED A FIVE OUT OF FIVE 
Great Game This is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game You get over 20 different vehicles and guns The TV like gameplay makes for a good story line There s hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first PS2 games Gran Theft Auto 50 Driv3r 30 Starsky and Hutch priceless 
Good for beginners too We just got a PS2 after having no game system at all since the old Atari I had when I was 13 So learning all the quot new fangled quot controls is a bit tricky Starsky and Hutch as well as being a fun game is straight forward enough that the learning curve was easy and enabled me to get right into the action without having to die a thousand times just to learn how to maneouvre As I get better with the controller the game is still proving to be fun and challenging without being frustrating 
Great cooperative game experience I haven t tried it with the light gun yet but even with 2 dual shocks this is a unique and accessible 2 player co op game one drives one shoots with decent replay value I don t think the difficulty can be increased but it s fun to go back and beat your old scores and play with the unlocked cars i suppose it could be finished in a rental but personally I find it s nice to own some simple co op games like this that you can pop in and play right away if a friend shows up esp if that friend is not a hardcore gamer as a 1 Player game it starts to feel like GTA lite after awhile although for kids this one is better because it lacks the mature content 
Fun Game Cicken Little is a fantastic game This game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting sports unioform hunt and more The best part I like is the Carpool Craze 
an excellent game with some ending problems what i mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it i can t even imagine a 5 star game i ve come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars anyway ahem this is about gun a very nice game i looked forward to a lot i played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it the positives graphics this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism and detail gun s detail was not like i dont know half life 2 or something i didn t repeatedly go wow unbelievable todays technology but i really enjoyed them they were pretty to look at they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing bright colorful open western vistas instead of dark gloomy tense industrial claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like i don t know 95 of all shooters it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such i appreciated that quite a bit difficulty well i can t remember if this game had difficulty levels but i like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice i do not like dying even if i can reload right away and i am not too great at these games well so up until the last part of the game more about that later i had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged the poker was too easy though and i could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through i thoroughly completed everything else characters voice acting pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting i don t want any spoilers here so i ll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline but i still liked them and they looked pretty good to me gameplay it was quite fun and varied it had some of the best bullet time ever called quickdraw or something i loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that i was beating 11 people in a gunfight the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express i liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do length i may be an exception but the vast majority of games go too long for me the feel of them and the things i do in them become redundant and i don t finish so i like that gun seemed manageable for the most part i was pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried like the way you can get every upgrade possible the negative story it should have gone a bit lighter i mean it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated they just have too much on their plate vis a vis gameplay and choice the cutscenes and acting were nice and it started solidly but storywise it progressively deteriorated or i guess was completely unable to fufill its set up it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but well more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me remember how i hate that but it was irritatingly stupid and senseless to the reality of the game conclusion wow only one big negative but the huge long ending boss battle really bugged me really good game though oh and by the way i have a pretty midlevel computer and fading fast and didn t have any real technical problems maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns but mostly it was smooth that s just you know for what that s worth anyway if some of what i am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out 
Great idea but incomplete execution Gun aims to be the Western version of GTA but falls short Taking the non linear story and side mission type action genre is a good idea but the game just feels incomplete to me It is fun to play but on my medium high end Pentium 4 3 GHz 1 MB RAM GeForce 6800 GT system the framerate slows down quite a bit Not just when entering new environments but at random times when I m wondering why The game probably wasn t fully tested The voice acting is good but the graphics aren t spectacular even at the highest level Of course I had to crank down the graphics to increase the performance Gameplay isn t bad but GTA is much better as tasks are more difficult and require more time to accomplish The game took about 8 10 hours to beat the story missions and 15 20 hours for me to acquire 100 completion I also had an issue with not being able to assign some keys like the semicolon key to the game I hope there is a patch to correct annoying issues like this A funny part of the game is when talking to the people that give you tasks like the Indian hunter marshal and others They talk with their hands and sometimes their hands move even when they re not saying anything It s downright hilarious in an untested sort of way The game is good and received an editor s choice award in PC Gamer I think it s overrated but they did mention framerate hits and lower standard graphics as Gun s weaknesses I give this game a 78 due to the many performance graphical issues I ve experienced Activision online technical support hasn t proven its worth to me at least not yet Hopefully a patch will come out 
A great escape I really enjoyed this game Yes it is not perfect but it is definitely worth the price of the game If you re looking for escape back to the old West then this is your game As many of the reviewers have mentioned there are some flaws in the game if you can get past them then I am positive you will enjoy the game The horse riding is fun but I also found myself enjoying the plot it plays like a movie The cut scenes are great fun to watch and are well voice acted The graphics are detailed as well I found that the artists took their time in modeling the weaponry of the era and it likely very historically accurate a big plus If you have ever wanted to be the star of a Western this is your chance If you like TV shows and movies such as Gunsmoke Deadwood and Once Upon a Time in the West you ll probably wonder where this game has been I did 
Great Buy I guess this is a good buy especially when Corporate Vice President and Chief XNA Architect of Microsoft says so I just thought it was interesting when J Allard gave a review of this product on Amazon co 
Great product Great deal The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account even if you do have the headset The card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game limited time offer easily helps to make your money back Even if they didn t include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate In fact it s almost like you re getting a headset for free So like I said if you need live buy Also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at Best Buy I checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit 
This is a Kit not just the card This is the KIT not just a card A previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 That is not correct They are selling the CARD for 49 99 This kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more You may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly It does what it intends to do 
The most beautiful game on the market The game has a LOT of plot development and cutscenes If you are into it then that s great I find I scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue That being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen I find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is The action is good and the plot does suck you in Nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it s predecessors Completely worth your while 
With a story as detailed and absorbing as Xenosaga III s it s nearly impossible to not be hooked Xenosaga Episode I remains a type of paragon for a story and character driven RPG There was so much to tell in the game that players looking to sink their teeth into a 40 or so hour cinematic RPG wouldn t need to look any further and would also be very satisfied Episode II was a bit shorter and not quite as good as the first installment However Xenosaga III is as good as an RPG can get I love to watch films with solid plots and memorable meaningful characters It is a pleasure to experience a video game that can achieve that kind of involvement through a long period of 40+ hours Episode III throughout its duration constantly engrosses the player with the many plot developments flashbacks and insights into the many characters Every primary characater is respected with deep explorations into their own motives and agendas Everything about the game is meticulously crafted Every bit of plot and dialogue builds upon itself from the intro all the way to the conculsion and still there is room for much more to be pondered There are some very memorable music pieces in the game which really accecntuate the current mood They really serve to bring the emotional weight of the characters to life The voice acting is great all around There never is a moment when the acting sounds forced or laughable The difficulty is for the most part quite easy It is only until the near end of the game where some bosses may cause you to see the Game Over screen a few too many times I actually spent three days stuck on one boss The solution to this was to stay driven and continue to try different strategies The good thing is that your characters can be switched out at any time and even though the battle parties only consist of three members the rest of your comrades whether they are in battle or not will also receive experience points from fighting and will stay leveled with your main battle members This way you can use them later for crucial battles when they are needed without having to take the trouble to level them I enjoyed Xenosaga III from beginning to end A game like this is especially a treat to a player who appreciates an in depth character driven plot heavy game The philosophical and theological themes explored within in it raise many questions about human beings and the world There are characters who fight and give their lives for ideals There are also individuals who struggle to find the meaning in their own lives and what path they should take The role of destinty and fate are strong components in the game There is always something brewing throughout this adventure There is always something that captivates you and makes you think twice about setting the controller down 
A good conclusion to an underdeveloped premise Xenosaga Episode 1 took us in Although the flaws in that game were many the story was sufficiently entertaining and interesting to warrant the praise that was given to the game and the clunky play mechanics Xenosaga Episode 2 was awful Plain and simple it was awful Any of the interesting cliff hangers from episode 1 were either answered stupidly or not at all The game not only possessed a lackluster storyline with extra characters introduced merely for confusion s sake but I have NEVER seen a battle system more user unfriendly and more monotonous and clunky than that of episode 2 At times I wanted to throw my PS2 against the wall particularly when fighting the patriarch A terrible game which seemed to kill the series until Episode 3 which is a throwback to simpler RPG fare and works quite well In Episode 3 the battles are actually interesting to fight at least early on I enjoy the use of the boost counter for once No more will you guess at whether Shion s attack is useful against enemy A or whether you should switch to say chaos Instead characters are divided into three classes attackers defenders and supporters healers It s a pretty simple system no Also the story kicks back into high gear I won t spoil anything except to say that finally the Testaments which were alluded to in Episode 1 but completely ignored other than tangential referral in episode 2 have returned and let s face it Wilhelm is a much more compelling character than say a young Albedo Finally the wheels which began spinning in episode 1 come full circle In fact it seems as if episode 2 could have been skipped entirely with no loss of continuity There are numerous nods to Xenogears in this game and by the way the gear sequences are actually quite fun the character battles in episode two were only trumped in boredom by the gear battles In any case Xenosaga 3 is a worthy addition to the library It has flaws again it would be nice to have action sequences and movie sequences move more seamlessly although it s infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 but it s a fun game 
Might as well For newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it However if you ve already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable A few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore The story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game So if you ve been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you I however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line 
A brilliant addition and finish to the Xenosaga series Xenosaga Episode 3 Also sprach Zarathustra brings back the magic of Episode 1 and fixes the vast majority of the problems that occurred in Episode 2 The story here as rich and complex as ever is brought to an appropriate and moving close as Shion and company battle to uncover a deep seated conspiracy unlike anything else they ve ever encountered The fabric of the story itself the voice acting and the cutscenes are all truly superb it s remarkable that the makers at Namco Bandai managed to pull all of the loose ends together to make the story finally make sense To boot it s a pleasure to watch and listen to who could ask for more As for the battle system it finally regains its fun in Episode 3 I simply wasn t a fan of Episode 2 s system so the return to basics was a blessing in my mind The characters still do battle in their unique ways as each has his her own customizable skills to obtain but long gone are the days of ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies Here in both ground and E S mech battles your ability to strengthen and customize your party shines through and you are always rewarded for your hard work Replay value is moderate to high as well since your party consists of all the familiar players for most of the game if you have a habit of using the same three or four people like me yay for chaos you can always play through again with a different group Shops return in this Episode making buying and selling your merchandise once again possible The only thing lacking is this game is a little more in the extras side quests department of which this game only offers a handful While some of these take longer than others a few more side quests would have been nice particularly since this is the last in the series I can t rave enough about how impressed I was with this title It rivals Episode 1 in every way possible and the trilogy s epic story outstrips other RPG competition without question If you re looking for fun battles a fantastic story and beautiful graphics then look no further Xenosaga Episode 3 is for you I can only hope that someone changes their mind and decides to make another one after this exceptional closing Episode it s hard not to wish for another game to come along in the future Very highly recommended Summary Story A+ Cutscenes A Graphics Rendering A Battle Skill System A Extras Side Quests A Replay Value Moderate to Hig 
A game I trully did not want to stop playing This game remains one of my favorite games of all time I m an old school game I ve played computer games since I had an atari st with cartridge I played the other GTA games I liked them very much they are all addictive This one this one is trully the jewel in the crown There are many things I could say but I just don t want to repeat the same waffle It s a great game the characters are all superb voiced by great actors Ray Liotta is just on fire as Tommy Vercetti I m still suprised they got all of this talent there seems to be no stone un turned even Blondie get s a minor part This is many thumbs way up Indeed it s notorious it s not for minors though no doubt there are more minors played this than adults A lot of it s subject matter are just for kicks just teh kind of amusement we seek because it s the kind of thing we would never normally do in our wildest dreams The other part inmo is jsut sheer style I can t recommend this title enough The only possible downside to it and this is just being picky is the loading times between various parts of the city This was eliminated in San Andreas but this one is the one I run this town ME Tommy Vercetti 
One Of The Greatest Vice City is awesome When im not doing missions Im usually runnin from the law I love the one liners Vercetti says D UR all D If I have to kill you I WILL One thing i dont like is there isnt an AK47 in the game instead they put the Ruger which is a variant But since this is th pc version thr are mods that can change it The wanted level is as follows 1 If a cop sees you hell go after you 2 More aggresive than last one 3 Police at their most agressive height w helicopters to track you down easier and Miami Vice is called to scene they pull up in a cheetah packin Uzi 9MMs 4 SWAT Team arrives in armored trucks in a unit of 4 also packin Uzis 5 If youve made it this far i suggest you get a car and mash upon the gas pedal cause now the FBI is after you These guys pull up in jet black suburbans packin MP5s 6 Now youve really done it The Army is on its way and their strapped to kill These guys arive in Rhino tanks Barracks army trucks The only thing you can do now is run for cover cause the Rhinos will blow up your car on contact unless you dodge them Another mistake ive found is that the Army uses MP5 like the FBI in the game when they should be using M16s you can also change that in the PC version 
Another Kid s Review I am a kid I will NOT reveal my age but I have been playing GTA for a few years It has entertained me so much I just got the PS2 version and I am ordering the PC version Here is my rating in detail 1 Horrible 2 Bad 3 So So 4 Good 5 Impressive Gameplay 4 I m sorry I can t say that GTA Vice City has no glitches because it does have many glitches Other than that the gameplay is perfect Kept me busy for hours Audio 5 HOLY The sound in GTA Vice City is so cool the 80 s radio the realistic firearm sounds the car s engine the pitterpatter of your shoes wow That s all I can say Graphics 3 GTA has never I repeat NEVER took full advantage of graphics They have always been low quality for their time but good enough so that it s playable It s pretty modern Missions 5 The missions go in deep and affect the storyline in ways you can t imagine One even involves going around in an ice cream truck and selling ice cream with drugs in it It s vulgar but fun Overall 4 1 out of a possible 5 A highly ranked game in my book I hope you enjoy it too

Important for Nintendo fans With the Wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one Some preordered it while some others including me are camping out for it But some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction Sure sideways Wii controllers are S NES controllers but what of gamecubes I am happy to say that I have gotten a chance to play around with the Wii before anyone else And yes the wavebird Receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the Wii It looks pefectly at home there Rejoice gamers Pick up your wavebirds and play on 
Excellent High Quality no lagging The bottom of the controller sticks out quite a bit but this does not affect gameplay and other than that it is the same size as the regular gamecube controller Simply fantastic unless you re one of those people that just NEED to have rumble for some reason But one slight problem Is it just me or do the trigger buttons occasionally fail For example in Resident Evil 4 I ll be holding the R button to aim but it will quickly go back and forth from normal view as if the button cancels out However this is rare and maybe it s just me Once again an excellent high quality controller 
Awesome the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is Super Smash Bros Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle 
I felt like I was 11 years old again playing this game I bought a nintendo ds so I can play super mario brothers for ever like I was when I was a kid Its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger My 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and I had to buy him a DS along with mario so he could play it after I left to go back home 
Lotta Fun Old School Style It s a fun game If you like Super Mario don t miss It wasn t as good as previous classic games like SMB SMB 3 or SMBW but it sure is fun I played every level except the last one is too hard I looked up the video on YouTube and decided that was good enough I hate hate hate when levels are too hard and you have to be a computer to pass them The last level is the only hard one I tried about 25 times and gave up and watched the video online If a game is too hard I m not going to sit there all day doing the same thing over and over again This is a great game except for that last frustratingly repetitious level 
GTA3 Vice City SA Best games ever created The GTA series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created 
The most freedom you can have in a videogame today Okay first of all this game is a VERY violent game and i would NOT recommend parents to buy it for children under 13 You must also make sure that they know the violence and crime is FAKE There will be serious consequences for doing these things in real life and they know not to do what they do in this game Back to the game this is simply hands down the best game ever created It is an innovation within an innovaton The storyline is excellent as you get betrayed and shot by your friend during a bank robbery Later you must work your way through the dark streets of Liberty City working your way toward the ones who betrayed you The missions never repeat themselves and they are always fun and challenging BUT you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without codes and i do not know anyone who did So i strongly advise you get the codes before playing Other than that the sense of freedom this game gives you in between and after all of the missions is astounding You can go almost anywhere and do almost anything something never before acheived in a video game Gameplay 5+ Extremely fun and addictive especially when you have a group of your friends around you to see your crazy runs from the law and laugh as you drive your car off a cliff into the ocean nothing beats the feeling when you watch your friend do the same thing Sound 5 The radio stations are great especially game fm The commercials are extremely hilarious and you can even make your own custom radio station with your own tunes Graphics 4 Allright but could be better Storyline 5 Great story very fun missions I really have to congratulate rockstar with their acheivment in the video game industry Great job guys As for the people reading this if this game is on its way to your house right now click the buy button above Bottom line WOW 
Great Game Grand Theft Auto is now in 3rd person perspective No more overhead camera Well at least it s not the only mode of view That in itself makes this game great You re an escaped convict that s trying to establish a name for himself and make some money by completing missions The cities are virtually yours Vast easy to explore no limitations You can jump and hijack any car beat a poor old lady with a baseball bat even steal police cars But don t go too trigger happy or else the feds will be all over you You take on various missions and upon completing them you receive credits and advance onto more interesting and complicated ones GTA3 is great fun to play Good graphics a lot of missions to complete very many cars and weapons 
Lots of fun If you re looking for a game that teaches you some life skills or some morals ethics this is not the game for you If you re looking for a game where you get to blow all sorts of stuff up and wreck havoc and mayhem you ve come to the right place Some of the challenges in the game are nearly impossible Which is fine because then you can just drive around the city and cause chaos Cheats make the game much more fun since it gives you weaponry you would otherwise not be able to get for instance a tank This game is great for when a person needs to relieve some stress and wants a forum to take out their frustrations without fear of legal consequences But this game is definitely not for kids Killing innocent people carjacking vehicles beating up prostitues for money and murdering cops is material that is totally inappropriate for children But for adults looking for non wholesome fun this is it My only complaint about the game are some of the glitches walking through walls getting stuck in walls etc 
Fun fun and more fun Awesome game loads of fun All a guy needs Women Money Cars Power not necessarily in that order 
Same GTA with some RPG touches As one might suspect GTA San Adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving guns galore and a lawless protagonist and a linear storyline Let s be honest though nobody buys GTA to JUST play the mission part and in fact I have a hard time getting into the missions In San Andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game unless you want to cheat The clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay Haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase You have various parts of your character that can be built up fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc Obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry The others are self explanatory Some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game The hydra which is a harrier type jet the stunt plane an attack helicopter a four wheeler a parachute and my favorite the jetpack Other than that the game is like each created before it from GTA 3 on The graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired Whatever engine they use is clearly the same as GTA 3 Animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic Music from the radio stations is lackluster but I believe it is possible to use your own music instead As a computer game San Adreas controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done In the worst case scenario the hydra however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking If you want to shoot something below you be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction I myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the USB port on the computer Even with that it is not much better and you still need the D pad to make decent turns As you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game Overall Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has a lot to offer if you don t have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls I would rate it a 7 out of 10 
Castlevania Curse of Darkness Who needs Belmont Castlevania as a whole started with one thing in mind kill the vampire plaquing the land The same can be said about Castlevania Curse of Darkness You play as Hector a devilforge master What s a Devil Forge master you ask A person with the ablity to create monsters and or weapons Devil forge masters in this game have the same amount of power as Dracula s right hand man Death Huge 3D like invorments like from LOI wild monsters gorgeous graphics and a suporior sound track help Hector along the way to get revenge for the love of his life Rosaly As far as story line time this happens a little after Castlevania 3 Dracula s curse So in other words you old school guys like me will enjoy seeing what happeded after Castlevania 3 Pick it up today you will NOT BE SORRY Oh yea did I mention that you get to play as Trevor Belmont Oh I didn t good luck and make Dracula pay 
True To Your Dreams Castlevania Curse of Darkness is a true gem among xbox games I think it was more designed to be a bridge for a game that s coming out in the future that be two player Probably xbox360 or Play station 3 So they have get you the gamers used to someone other Trevor Belmont One Dracula Is NOT DEAD He get s reborn he needs one of the devil forger masters to get reborn So its either Hector or Isaac who has to die to bring forth Dracula So since your Hector and that leaves only Isaac who becomes Dracula Dracula is mad at Hector for running off during the big battle thus blaming him for his down fall to Trevor Belmont But here only point in the whole game that gets me Hector is way up in the army of evil and he has a change of heart just because Dracula wants to kill every human who wants them destroyed That part brothers me but who cares its fun game anyway hacking and slashing all the creatures of the dark So its like a complexed stories line But along the way you don t know what s what s It come to you in the movies and not all what you see is what is Like in the beginning you meet Zead and Saint Germain Now Zead wants to help you on your quest and Saint Germain wants to try and stop you They both hate each other Zead seems so nice and Germain like a total pain Why not any help that helps you average the death of your wife to the town people who bur her as a witch sounds good You have to fight Saint Germain latter and to tell you the truth he is hard he pulls out a gun try s to shoot you when he near death Latter you find out Zead is Death the Grimm Reaper after you fight Isaac and Zead takes Isaac and turns him into Lord Dracula for the final fight When you beat Dracula you seen the ending Now everyone says this game is to short When actual its two games you can play as Trevor Belmont and its totally different then playing as Hector as game play is concern more classical Castlevania from the NES and SNES days So if you don t like the devils and want a more classical game try beating it once and play as Trevor But you also find out in the ending from Saint Germain there will be another finial battle hint another game of Castlevania in the works So honestly the game play is cool the battles are fun and if you play long enough you can truly enjoy this game and its plot twists It took me 30 hours to beat it with hector and I m finish play it with Trevor Belmont but can say its good I cant campare this to the play station games my last Castlevania was Castlevania X for SNES It reminds me a lot of that game the stages do but these are more in detail and more fun 3d One more then there is a love stories at the end yes I know not what you where expecting between Hector and Julia Laforeze Doesn t it melt your heart Yes Isaac sister and the hero How ironic There hidden stages more bosses after you beat it and its truly a gem among xbox games Some will be mad cause I wrote this but the cheesy plot line about Dracula being death and fighting for so long to beat this game figure ill just go ahead and tell it Its great game 
One of the best Xbox games As someone who enjoyed previous Castleavania games going back to the early Nintendo systems I did find this new incarnation to be somewhat different than the 2D games of old But I still liked it a lot Basically this game has been my main preoccupation for the last 2 weeks or so I d rank it as one of the top 5 Xbox games I ve ever played out of 50 or so in terms of sheer fun level Primarily I liked the fact that as you gain new items skills you can go back to previously explored areas and new areas will open up This expanding universe aspect makes it similar to the Super Metroid games and a little like some of the Zelda titles for Gamecube I also found the Combine system of seeking out materials to create new weapons and armor to be very engrossing and I liked the various ways to obtain those materials steal from monsters seek out hidden rooms etc The graphics and sound FX are well below the all time great level of games like Halo 1 or 2 but they re perfectly servicable ranging from very good to excellent I thought the spooky ambiance of the various castle hallways dungeons etc was actually captured rather well Although I did completely get into the process of exploring the various worlds of this game especially with the help of some online FAQ references I will concede a few drawbacks The currency s uses are fairly limited There s only one shop and the things you most want or need cannot be bought there And in the later stages of the game you accumulate a lot of excess cash that can t be used for anything Also the process of levelling up your character and his I D innocent devil companions definitely got rather repetitive and a little boring after awhile Those are minor drawbacks however Overall this is a great game 
The Curse of 3D Castlevania games Castlevania Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die hard Castlevania fan might not much get into Lament of Innocence wasn t a terrible game but it wasn t great And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth it has problems Sometimes scary problems Like Lament of Innocence it had so much potential to be good this title more so But it doesn t deliver and that s a sad revelation to admit to especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash Dawn of Sorrow Ever since the 1997 all time best Symphony of the Night so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception He looks a little like Alucard But we re not here to discuss that Hector is a Devil Forgemaster one who has given up his powers Dracula is dead but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia Hector however isn t concerned about what kind of shape the world is in He s more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac who has killed his beloved If you couldn t guess it s time for revenge And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome And by doing so Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot The story actually unfolds with excellent voice acting but there isn t much story Since Symphony of the Night we ve been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania This is marvelous and once again makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania You explore a large castle riddled with goodies This includes weapons subweapons armor and much more Playing the game can be quite fun Most of the game as you might have guessed is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters That isn t as boring as you might think You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies but each one must be finished with the B button You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos This makes the camera go crazy though but this is forgiveable Battling without locking on is actually much better and it isn t too hard to do without Although if you want to steal from your enemies you ll have to lcok on to em Speaking of stealing it s nice that you can actually do that Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage Again you must be locked on for it to happen Likewise unlike Lament of Innocence they actually use the level up system In other words there s actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time You also have little helper monsters You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror but the better comparison would be Pokemon They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies just as you do It s nice not to have to go at it alone but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone Each enemy also drops evolution crystals Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve You won t grow to like them though That s the sad part and they don t really enhance the gameplay The monsters have special abilities though Golem like creatures can open heavy doors imps let you bury underground But you can t help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters Also no evolution crystal is the same You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve One of the nice things about being a devil forger you can make your own weapons And Hector can do it at any time he wants That s right no running back to some stupid shop to do it Monsters often drop raw materials and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger You can do this simply by opening the menu I don t know about you but that s pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that The weapons have their own little downside however With the exception of the sword none of them are highly helpful in combat You start the game off with a short sword and you ll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use Other weapons just aren t fast enough and enemies aren t weak to a certain weapon type This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points Unless you re a person who likes to use cool looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons you won t have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system except to power up your sword Thus experimenting with weapons garners no fun It is pretty cool I must say to be venturing somewhere that isn t Dracula s castle Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia Meaning you ll trek through swamps mountains valleys and a lot more So if you re tired of Dracula s castle this is quite a change The problem with this world is that you don t see enough of it There s not enough detail to it You have to follow a beaten path so it isn t really that different than Dracula s castle in Lament of Innocence so you can t go off and just explore the places you re at The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from the lack of detailed enviroments You ll no doubt run down the same path hall corridor several times over If it weren t for the map you d find yourself lost thinking you must be in one of those looping ares or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle The monsters are also not so great What I love about the 2D Castlevania games especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow is how much variety is thrown into the monsters The attacks they use on you Even if they re the same looking monster they throw in some new attack that you don t expect Curse of Darkness like Lament of Innocence has no variety You ll run into the same batch of monsters constantly and they ll never do something new Later in the game you ll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new Likewise all the monsters you ll ever see are encountered pretty early on The moment you run into an Axe Armor you ve run into em all They ll never change I sound like I m being picky about the enemies thing but I m not It takes away from the challenge of the game The fact that reincarnates don t do anything new makes it more true And that s not the worst part the game overall just isn t a challenge The bosses can be at times but if you ve been playing 3D action games I think you ll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy Later on however they get start to get hard and that s when battling them actually becomes fun Again though if you re an action adventure pro you ll probably beat most of them on your first try I wish I could say the graphics are great Hey Hector looks great in combat But the enviroments don t have enough detail Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we ve been seeing for a long time now Where s the detail You know like maybe the leaves on a tree moving We re at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment instead of it seeming like we re running through a still life painting Visually it doesn t look half bad It s just that there could be so much more The bosses look cool and the framerate doesn t slow down at all but there isn t enough variety or detail However I must say this the music sounds AWESEOME As usual the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming Is it better than Symphony of the Night No it s not It isn t better than Lament of Innocence either which also had steller music but it is still among the best you ll ever hear in a video game Likewise the voice acting is actually really really GOOD I just wish I could ve heard more of it Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game But there are a lot of things that keep it down It s a fairly fun game to play but it lacks innovation You won t be able to separate it from the other action adventure 3D games It s got nothing that makes it stick out If you MUST have this game however I d say wait for a price drop If you re really looking for a good Castlevania game I d suggest getting a hold of Dawn of Sorrow It s a much better game The Good +Great Music Some of the best in gaming +Good weapon system +It s pretty fun to play +You can steal from enemies +Great Voice acting The Bad Little innovation Lack of cutscenes to advance the story Too much of the game gets recycled too fast Too easy The game doesn t look bad but there s little imagination in the environments Not a whole lot of different enemies It s too easy Boring level designs not enough of them You just can t help that the game has almost no innovation It s no different than your average action adventure 3D game Get Dawn of Sorrow or one of the other 2D versions of the game They seem to fare so much better than this one does Even the die hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland 
LOVED IT Saw the movie HAD to get the game I also have Project Zoo that was good too Overall not bad but then again we love Wallace Gromit Loved the fact a friend could join in at any time to help but you have to stay close though We found the camera engine was a tad of a pain like with two players the camera might get stuck in a wall blocking your view tunnels could be a problem but a quick fix we did was one player would exit play for a moment that would reset the camera then the other could rejoin It was a challenge to beat the game at 100 but my sister and I did just that Got a brain wedgie finding all the rabbits but loved it just the same Loved being free to roam about and explore try reading the little signs scattered about on walls They are cool Will play it again Addictive game fun to boot That from a thirty something yes I still play video games Some say all the weird ones Thank you Nick Park for allowing the games And making the movie 
GREAT GAME We rented this game out before we purchased it and we really like it We went to see the movie and our almost 4 year old son loved Shark Tale so we thought we d give the xbox game a try and happy we did Its really a great game The controls are pretty simple for our son to play the game he needs help with the game but overall he enjoys it My husband and I both like playing this game as well Its fun has pretty great graphics great music in the background good game play Its not to hard for kids but not to easy for adults either so you don t get bored of this game We have nt played very far into the game yet but so far its a big hit at our house 
Great Game Empty Ending I loved the game The characers are great The worlds are interesting it still deosnt look outdated And the combat is fairly strategic Unfortuneatley the games ending is rather lack luster 
Good Story Fun Game but Buggy I enjoyed playing this game when it would let me the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous crashes left and right It was a good story though I suppose I could give you a few tips To stop the Dantooine framerate from dropping go to the folder where your game files are ex c program files lucasarts swkotor2 and open the swkotor2 ini file on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it and under the Graphics Options heading insert a line and type Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 That should get rid of any bad framerate drops on Dantooine and at least make it playable Also I had a glitch near the end of the game where I went back to Dantooine but when I tried to get off my ship the planet wouldn t load I tried restarting and all that jazz nothing worked finnaly I found online a cheatcode to warp straight to Dantooine so to use it open the swkotor2 ini file as I said above and under the Game Options header insert a line and type EnableCheats=1 Then Start StarWars KOTOR2 and load your game and press this button the one with the sign right above it just above the tab key Then type warp 605dan Then Press Enter Don t worry about the fact you can t see your typing the cheat console is invisible And Tada Your on Dantooine and Can finish your game The only other advice I have for you is Save Often and Don t OverWrite Your Saved Games I found that saving your games as 1 2 3 4 etc to be a quick way to do this May the Force be with You 
A decent game Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG s It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent 
Are this cables gonna work for the PS3 I ve read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the PS3 Since the PS3 originally only comes with the traditional wires AV cables im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal hd pic quality Or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones 
Good Product It works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original A V Cables 
Just what the doctor ordered Very good cable Get it if you have a PS2 and a component input on your TV Much better picture than composite cables 
Great but I did find one thing These Component AV cables make a world of difference in video quality Especially on HDTV Some Images now appear pixelated this may be the game I am playing But everything else is smooth crisp and clear Text is three times as easy to read I reccomend these for any HDTV owner 
Deserves to be the best Xbox game of the year If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360 buy this game first as your last Xbox game you won t be disappointed This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console Although it has great graphics the physics are the real selling point You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun Zero Point Energy Manipulator Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should especially when you shoot them with the shotgun The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around The only drawback is choppy framerates at times Highly recommended 
Half Life 2 Pros and Cons Pros 1 Storyline is very detailed There is a lot of twists and turns I m not going to spoil it find out for yourself 2 The weapons are very nice Everything from the classic crowbar YAY and the gravity gun preform very well You can damage just about anything in the environment and use it to your advantage 3 The physics are amazing Water rippling to things flying through the air is all very well done Makes you get a real sense of the game 4 The A I is challenging and varified Also different weapons work better on some than others so it s fun to experiment 5 THere is no really specific road to follow in this game You can explore and find secret compartments and stuff 6 There is actually a bunch of little thinkers in this game In order to get somewhere like in a sewage tunnel or over a fence you may have to do something first such as flip a switch or put something somewhere Gives you a challenge 7 Saving is nice You can save anywhere in the game So if you lose you ll just go back to you last checkpoint Cons 1 It loads a lot If you have an xbox w a lot of games on it it might load slower I m not positive though It runs pretty good on mine but yeah there is quite a lot of point loading But the game itself makes up for it I rated Half life 2 4 5 stars b c it is a very good game It is very accurate with it s gameplay making it as challenging as fun Plus who can t resist playing baseball with headcrabs 
Very Good Game But The Xbox Lets It Down I just finished HL2 on the Xbox and thought some of my observations might be helpful to other prospective buyers My review is primarily concerned with my struggle between getting HL2 for PC or Xbox I bought HL HL Opposing Force and HL Blue Shift for the PC when they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them Due to the HL2 Xbox price and the horror stories I d read about having to be online to use the PC version of HL2 I decided to go for the Xbox version Did I make the right choice HL2 is a very good game and at 20 for the Xbox version represents excellent value for money Great graphics great sound and engaging game play However I think HL1 on the PC is a better game than HL2 on Xbox Why First the original HL was much more open ended and there was often more than one way to do something or get somewhere With HL2 I found there was only one way Second the controls for HL1 were better and configurable With HL2 on Xbox I found some controls to be really awkward and difficult to use For example there s an air boat to drive and the direction and throttle are on the same thumb stick I assume throttle and direction are separate keys on the PC version Third when there s a lot going on for example several Combine soldiers firing at you explosions and a fair bit of scenery to display the Xbox slowed down to almost a halt It just couldn t cope with that amount of processing I never had that problem with HL1 on the PC and assume a suitably equipped PC could cope with HL2 just as well Lastly as others have mentioned you didn t have to go very far in HL2 before you saw a loading screen The frequency at which you saw this did become distracting and annoying after a while One plus for HL2 is there s no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there was in HL1 Remember all that hopping from floating platform to floating platform and plants that light up when you went near them All that nonsense has gone away which was a relief On reflection most of my gripes about HL2 have more to do with the Xbox version rather than the game itself If I had to choose again I d buy HL2 on the PC and will certainly get any HL2 spin off games for the PC if they are to appear like they did for HL1 If not I ll wait for HL3 which the ending of HL2 leaves open 
Sheer perfection GOTY of the year 2004 My best friend is a Halo lover When I learned of this game I was not that interested until I read some reviews and saw videos of what you could do in the game not to mention the graphics For quite a while my best friend and I got into a crazy dispute inbetween which game is better I enjoy Halo but Half Life 2 just overpowers it so much On the P C I think the only thing that could beat it is Half Life 3 once it comes out and that is what my friend says about Halo 2 the only thing that will beat it is Halo 3 Now Half Life 2 on the P C doesn t take an entirely high tech computer in fact you can have a graphic card with Direct X7 for this game on the P C If you own the P C version I m sure you have been told before there is no reason to buy it on Xbox which is true The game is a port of the P C version and you will probably find nothing new in the Xbox version caompared to the P C version If you have an incredibly high P C don t waste your money on the Xbox version because a P C with at least an ATI Radeon X800 video card 2 4ghz processor 512mb ram I m pretty sure can run the game at max I m not sure I don t own the P C versoin Okay now for the game itself This game does NOT have a multiplayer componant so if you are only in the game for the multiplayer side of things YOU WON T find any If you are complaining you will understand why this game has no multiplayer componant by the end of this review Half Life the original game was released by Valve a game company in the year of 1999 and went on to be the computer game of that year Six years later SIX years Valve worked on a sequel and released it in 2004 The game is my favorite game of all time for now The game won nine GOTY Game of the Year awards in 2004 which included Game of the Year it beat Halo 2 P C game of the year Outstanding innovation in Computer Gaming Outstanding Achievemant in Animation Outstanding Achievmant in Art Direction Outstanding Character Performance Male Outstanding Achievmant in Game Play Engineering Outstanding Achievmant in Visual Engineering and First Person Action Game of the Year So it won nine GOTY awards but it nominated in eleven Since Half Life 2 is such a story driven game I will begin at the storyline If you have not played Half Life 1 the storyline may not make much sense which makes the game even better because you get to puzzle your past storyline with the world you are currently in Not even I have yet understood everything about what happened in the first Half Life game and I probably never will But to give you some sense of what is happening is that you play as a character named Gordan Freeman who several years ago was transfered over to a science research facility called Black Mesa From what I know Gordan accidentally unleashed alien races upon the earth I will not say anymore to ruin the storyline because the less you know the better it is I ruined quite a bit of the storyline for myself becuase I found out too much about the game Now for characters Characters in the game are incredibly realistic I have been told before that Valve created into the characters faces what they called muscles In the game the characters obviously do not have real muscles but if you look at the movement of the characters jaws they actually move escpecially during the opening scene Besides the complexity of the characters realistic looking muscles the characters have excellant voices that could not have anyone else doing their voices better The characters will actually be more immeresed into the game rather than your average F P S In areas where there is only dialoge which are enjoyable you might notice that if someone is talking to you they will be looking directly at you If you go behind them while they are talking to you they will turn around instead of just stand there talking to thin air If there is something passing by a character like a friend their eyes will actually follow the person walking by which always amazes me Gameplay Probably every review of this game you find will most likely have it s largest section on the gameplay of Half Life 2 and for good reason There is a single element that truly makes writing about the gameplay worthwhile Physics Most games that you play will have something known as Ragdoll Physics this is where if you are to find a dead enemy nearby they will move around according to their enviroment For example if you were to walk over a dead body in a game with Ragdoll Physics the body will most likely start rolling These are physics found in games like Republic Commando and Far Cry Half Life 2 is built in with a unique physics engine made by Valve called Havok Physics Havok Pysics is one of the best versions of the physic engines abailable on the gaming market Every object in the game has different weights and when you strike shoot move or whack those objects they actually feel real and look real The explosions made with this physics engine are so amazing and when you shoot explosive barrels you can see red shattered pieces fly in different directions looking like the explosion came from the inside which it did You will find most of the physics interactible through one of the best weapons in first person shooters today The Gravity Gun This weapon has the Law of Physics built right into it pretty much everyting is your weapon and I think you could figure it out from there More of the gameplay would be including your fameous hazard suit which can provide you with shielding if you charge it The suit will also allow you to breath underwater for a time being it comes equipped with a rechargeable flashlight and a cool sprint feature which recharges too Gamespy said in the P C review of Half Life 2 that throughout the game you are introduced with new weapons one by one and whenever you get a new weapon you are put in situations that you will need that weapon so you can learn which enemies you should shoot with which weapons where to use the weapons and how to use them tactically which is a very good way to show you how to use the weapons of this game There are eleven weapons in this game which may seem small but with the Gravity Gun you do not need any more And I do not think that you could come up with any more weapons that you would want A I Half Life has pretty tough A I and they really know how to flank and throw grenades The grenades will draw you into areas that you will be shot up and killed or the grenades will kill you so the combat is pretty intense You can hear the Combine enemies talking to each other through radios in their helmets as they plan to attack you Overall the combine are the largest example of A I in Half Life 2 other enemies aren t as smart because they are more animalistic rather than human Sound For every weapon every voice every explosion every splash of water every alarm every organic noise you hear in this game WILL be good Water sounds are what you will find in most games just because they are all pretty much the same When you hear strange creatures getting shot and their legs break or blood splatters from them it sounds like it should Gun shots could not be wanted in any other way I already mentioned voices Ign s video review of the P C version of this game says that you cannot really say anything bad about this game that goes for the sound too Where next oh music The game has great music it has this strange feeling to it but it fits that is all I can really say Some reviews say that this game has bad framerate Gamespot but I will say that it only occurs when there is large amounts of physics taking place and if you say that so and so has better framerate than Half Life 2 I simply ask you Does that game have the Havok Physics Engine And if it does okay Half Life 2 is still better I said earlier that you will find out why there is no multiplayer componant of Half Life 2 available which is true it is because it is hard enough to get such a great game as Half Life 2 on the Xbox alone with it s complex physics engine If you want Half Life 2 in a multiplayer apect I would not blame you with the gravity gun that has to be fun But there is a game made from Valve on the Xbox made specifically for multiplayer called Counter Strike it is modern warfare from what I know with M 16s and alike but from what I have heard it is incredibly fun go ahead and buy that one if you want it is from the same company but just to know it will not look as good becuase Counter Strike is a pretty old game I think The game is supposed to be filled with crazy multiplayer combat but I have not played it so I will leave it at that I saved one of the largest parts of the game for last Graphics Valve has created a masterpiece when it comes to the graphics of this game Six years really allowed them to go as far as they could when it comes to their graphics this IS the best looking Xbox game out there Compared to the P C graphics with a ATI Radeon X800 video card it will not look that good and on the xbox there is some minor details that could not be brought up to what they should look like but they are details that you will not be paying that much attention to If you played a game where the graphics are impressive but still not that great walked up to a wall you can see the flaws and the fakeness of the graphics When you walk out a good twenty feet the wall will then look realistic In Half Life 2 the flaws are still there but you only need to be about ten feet away instead of twenty I wish I could keep on going and I probably can but I have spent at LEAST an hour typing this review to just say that this game is one of the best games out there and is most likely the best first person shooter on the xbox and probably always will be If you see a game with the words Valve on the front in a box outlined in white lines expect perfection unless it is counter strike those games are more based on the multiplayer side of things rater than all the aspects of a normal game My closing statement is that Half Life 2 is a game of sheer perfection it is the best xbox single player game available BUY THIS GAME It is worth it 
PS2 Perfection I was very eager to get this title on import knowing that it was somewhat unique in terms of it s genre label yes it has rpg elements but it s something quite separate I only wish there were more such games on the ps2 or any format for that matter This is storytelling videogame style at it s best Capcom Clover have produced a real gem it s an experience like Zelda a highly enjoyable slice of fantasy that is sure to hold you in it s thrall for some 50 hours or more a visual treat and beautiful soundtrack also If you consider yourself a gamer then get this it s destined for cult status in a word SUPERB 
Okami Review I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12 and she has had a ball playing it Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese that doesn t take away from the game s adventures The instructions given are very clear and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks it really is quite enjoyabl 
Zelda for the PS2 Okami is a fantastic game perhaps the last great game released on the PS2 Stylish fun and packed with a good bit of humor this game kept me occupied for over a week Although it can certainly be played a good bit faster most people will probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through the first time The action adventure style gameplay owes quite a bit to the Zelda series but the celestial brush adds a nice and original gameplay element Okami is not overly difficult I found it a bit on the easy side The camera can also be a bit troublesome in a few places as well but I would be hard pressed to find many other faults with this game Unless you have a real dislike for cel shaded graphics I would heartily recommend this game for any PS2 owner 
Innovative and beautiful This is the most unique game in recent years Okami is a mixture of different gameplay Prior to buying this game I was expecting more combat You control a reincarnated god wolf and travel thru many beautiful scenaries You will talk to people solve simple fun puzzles do some platforming collect weapons play mini games and fight cool enemies Your goal is to save ancient Japan from demons The setting is very unique Its Japanese mythology with cell shaded graphic which resembles Ancient Japanese water oil painting There are cool Japanese style towns cherry blossoms trees beautiful environment and mythological enemies beast with a Japanese twist A visual pleasing game You will want to see what the next level looks like its like traveling The bosses are really cool too The characters are zany and funny One disappointment is the lack of voice acting you have to read text Minus 0 5 points for overall score The combat portion does not happen during the normal game there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined border A unique aspect of this game is the celestrial brush Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush There are many different brush powers You can draw and fill missing bridge gap draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day These are few examples The game difficulty is pretty easy Overall a fun adventure ride for everyone all ages and players Graphics 4 5 5 Music Sound 5 5 Story 5 5 Gameplay 4 5 Design 5 5 Fun 4 5 5 Value 5 5 Overall 4 5 
I LOVE this game But there are some problems with it I can t get enough of Okami I ve beaten it and am started on a second play though Any action RPG game fan has to at least try this game The title basically says it all It is a typically Japanese play on words since depending on how you translate it Okami can mean either wolf or king of the gods For those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game here are the basics 100 years before the game s beginning a huge 8 headed dragon monster called the Orochi menaced the small village of Kamiki After suffering Orochi s tyranny for years the village s champion Nagi and a white wolf the village dubbed Shiranui defeated the Orochi Shiranui died from his wounds after the fight and the village built a shrine for him Peace reigned for 100 years until the evil suddenly and mysteriously reappeared You control Shiranui reborn in a quest to save the land from the evil You travel all over the land of Nippon which is Japanese for Japan how original fighting monsters helping people and healing nature of the curse of evil The story is nothing new and is both very linear and quite predictable But it is very well done mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor The story has one major downside though it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket loads of exposition You will often find yourself button mashing X desperately to try to speed things along and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes don t let you speed up the dialogue For instance the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action Most of the rest are not nearly that long but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least To say that it gets tedious is an understatement Still the cell shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes They are done in a very beautiful yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional Japanese ink painting Despite the simple style though the level of detail is outstanding In fact it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown This game really pushes the hardware of the PS2 to its limits The music and sound are also fantastic Most of the music evokes traditional Japanese art as much as the graphics do while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees and more The mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you re visiting Except possibly with the voices Rather than real voices people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater While it does not bother me personally some people simply can not listen to these voice effects Either you ll hate the voice noises with a passion or you won t care at all Either way this is not a good point for the game The controls take a bit of getting used to but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature Unlike the Legend of Zelda games there is no enemy lock on during combat Instead you automatically target the closest monster s when you push the attack button This simplifies combat without turning it into a button mashing cake walk It works perfectly unless you get hit by the controller bug Yes a bug in the game Thankfully rare as I only encountered it twice in 60+ hours of game play Still when it happens it is extremely annoying During combat while you re wailing away on a monster the options menu will suddenly open for no reason Usually the analog control on your controller will also go crazy either just turning off or madly flickering on and off Either case makes the game impossible to play of course since you control your in game avatar with the left analog stick The first case is easy to fix just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu In the second case you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in Far more common than the controller bug are the load times They usually are not terrible but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so Between these and the long cut scenes you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included But there is game play and it is a lot of fun There is a great deal to keep you occupied from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts races puzzles and mini games Between fighting to save the world you can go fishing feed animals catch thieves and a lot more Plus after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras including image galleries and the sound track All of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out Rent it before you buy it if possible to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes numerous load times and weird voice effects But if you are a fan of action RPGs like Legend of Zelda you will definitely want to add Okami to your game library Summary Pros Great story Great graphics Great music sound Wonderful atmosphere Lots of culture and mythology to give it flavor Plentiful activities and mini games Unlockable extras after beating the game Cons Occasional graphic slowdown Too much exposition Tedious cut scenes Lots of load times Rare controller bug Neutral Voice noises that you might or might not hate Over all score Five stars of fun fun fun But three stars over all because of the many problems 
WOW a new legendary game this is a master piece its art its beatiful where do i start words don t describe this game i love it the music is wonderful this game combines all the the good elements in gaming into a single one mystical ninja music weirdness + zelda perfection and i mean that there are no missable events or items in the game although there is only one missable in the game + some dragonball ideas not power ups i played this game for 133 hours of course everything is completed and i m sorry it ended you can finish the game much faster but i tend to enjoy such masterpieces RESULT if you love traditional japanese music culture + perfectly programmed games then this game is for you 
You don t have this game yet I will keep this review short The game is a very addictive entertaining RPG Great story great gameplay best game I played all year Only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies Took me about 45 hours to complete the Main story and almost all of the side missions If you buy this game you WILL play it to the end 
The Secret of the Old Clock is Fun Time Spent Its no secret that I m not a fan of point clicks They seem to be harder in general on my computer than 3 D action games which is something I ll never understand unless it has to do with the copy protection software I ve played through three or four of the Drew games Secret of the Old Clock was the most fun for me I liked the golf game and the sewing project I actually was proud when I finished the sewing side quest I liked driving around in the car In retrospect its analogous to guiding a magnet through a maze I had fun none the less I stumbled a little with the CB radio that got a little convoluted and bizarre but I did it The other games were either too hard or too easy This one will keep you occupied for a little while this one will employ an element of fun mar 
D D fan I love playing this game The Icewind Dale II is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great 
Really hits the spot Besides Baldur s Gate II Icewide Dale is the second most fun CRPG game out there More action than role playing which is fine with me This is a single player multi character game and you get to create the entire party of 6 adventures The plot is fairly weak but the action is plentiful and I love the fact that you get to develop 6 different characters If you have to get just one of the Icewind Dale games get Icewind Dale II The character generation and development is much better not to mention the gameplay and graphics 
This game is awesome in gameplay Pros 1 Character creation is fun detailed and basically unmatched by any game on the market much better than the NWN creation system 2 Graphic is beautiful but if you are expecting fully 3D environment you will be disappointed 3 Music is just awesome 4 Did I mention Character Creation is FUN Playing your custom made party is a very satisfying experience Any kind of team is playable You can solo the game too if you like Cons 1 Does not feature 3D environment like NWN 2 Gameplay is linear but I didn t care as the point of my game is to develope my character 
By comparison I have played all the rpgs Baldur s Gate NWN Dungeon Siege Final Fantasy TOEE etc And I have to say that stumbling upon Icewind Dale 2 was a real treat Sure the graphics are dated but WOW the storyline the dialogue the descriptions of the rooms and actions are all incredibly well written A breath of fresh air after playing DS The quests don t get in the way of the game like so many others that get bogged down in annoying side quests as a lame attempt to flesh out the world I would have prefered the game to be turn based like TOEE but this game s battles are numerous and really fun partially to good monster design compare bugbears in this game to NWN so much better and partially to the unforgettable situations and dungeons When pitted against other D D ruleset games the spell choices offered and levels they are given at is superior to all others I actually enjoyed having a Druid in my party who could transform his arms into pythons and for the first time in CRPG history actually used summon animals spells Even if many spells were simular to other games these felt more tailored to the characters and made useful instead of waiting till higher levels to get one useful spell My favorite part is that I could handpick my team where as in Baldur s Gate I was forced to play with characters I didn t like or NWN where it was removed and tedious to interact with henchmen I enjoyed RPing the characters backgrounds and interactions in my head and really enjoyed finding the treasure unique to IWD2 like a wide variety of cut gems which became an addiction If you updated this game graphically to the level of TOEE and made it Turn Based with battle tactics It would be my all time favorite RPG 
A great collection for any RPG I ve decided to buy this collection after a reading a lot of reviews from different websites But none of them are very clear about the contents of the package so here is the contents of the package 1 Icewind Dale 2 CD s 2 Icewind Dale Expansion Heart of Winter 1CD 3 Icewind Dale II 2 CD s 4 Icewind Dale soundtrack 5 Icewind Dale II bonus disk 6 Icewind dale strategy guides trailer of IWD II This package is well worth the purchase u get a series of one of the best selling game developed by pioneers who have also developed games like Fallout series BG1 abd BG2 The graphics are great they look bright and crisp The soundtrack is great and suits well with the ambience u really feel the snow falling and the cold weather The gameplay is fun it is more like a hack n slash game i m a greatest fan of diablo series so i love this game as well To put it in a nut shell this game is Hack n slash with D D rules If u like diablo u will certainly like this Baldurs gate fans will slightly get disappointed with the game play Charecter creation is great this game allows dual class charecters so it adds more fun to gameplay My only complaint is there is no interation within r party members but this doesn t affect the gameplay experience Overall if u ever have a thought of getting this game and don t know whether its worth the money the answer is plainly a best value for r money 
If you like the show you will enjoy the game I really enjoy this game I think they could have done better some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly I enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do However I ran into a glitch and I went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all I played 2 nights in a row thinking I did something wrong before I looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game One I followed the instuctions I was finally able to move on so watch out for that It s right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle then enter a wharehouse to protect Madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in The instructions I followed are as follows Turn on your PS2 is turned off with game and memory card in then load the game it should be at 4 28 If its not see NOTE below When the cut scene with Jack and Tony begins remove the memory card and the Warning memory card removed Use save game option to manually save progress re enable autosave Press X for OK and re insert the memory card then watch the cut scene The Previously on 24 dialog box will appear press X then play the game as usual If done correctly many men will enter After you complete the mission make sure you save it NOTE If your memory card is at 4 41 Go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene You will overwrite 4 41 and be back at 4 28 It helped me and if it happens to you believe me you will be glad you read this because I sure was 
FAN OF 24 MUST BUY IT If you enjoy the series you will love the game as simple as that Very entertaining Don t miss it 
The Best Game Ever I ve been a 24 fan ever since I saw the very first episode It delivered drama action and shocks and twists After the end of Season 2 and the beginning of season 3 I was left with questions How did David Palmer recover and how did Jack Bauer and Chase Edmunds first started working together Then I heard that 24 The Game was coming out and that it would answer those question plus more because it takes place between Seasons 2 and 3 In this game you get to play Jack Bauer yes Tony Almeida and Chase Edmunds When I first played this game I felt like I WAS Jack Bauer The graphics are stunning and look just like him It also has Kiefer Sutherland s voice which made it even more realistic This game nearly had me believing that I was living the life of Jack Bauer The game also has an amazing storyline it s pretty much watching another season It also nearly takes 24 hours to finish depending on how well you get used to it What is also great about this game is that while you are playing it it will go to split screen shots like on the show The game stays true to the show you have 24 hours to stop terrorist from unleashing devestating attacks against America and live the life of Jack Bauer I highly recommend buying this game for all of the 24 fans beginners and for the those who have watched it from the beginning It is in my opinion the best game ever made So far 
PS2 still the Best This is my second PS2 I traded my first on in on a Xbox 360 which only lasted 91 days before it died read all about it in my 360 review Leary of version 1 0 PS3 I opted to go back to the PS2 and its proven reliability and copious games for less money I got a set of HDTV cables a wireless controller and have not looked back What a fool I was to fall for Microscams empty promises This is the best game system You can even play online for free The games are more challenging and last a lot longer than the 360 games which I could beat in a week playing an hour a day The warranty is awesome at 1 year parts and labor I am not worried however because I had my original PS2 for 10 years without issue before trade in A fantastic system at an unbeatable price I will keep this one for at least a year before trading it in on a PS3 once all of the bugs are fixed and the price goes down to 400 Until then long live the PS2 
Great You can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric 
Best Sim Basketball Game Out There First off I own both NBA 2K6 and NBA Live 2006 and have been playing both since they have come out At first I thought that NBA Live 2006 was a better game until I played NBA 2k6 more and more and realized that it was the best simulation basketball game out there The addition of the shot stick to this year s game changes the way you shoot as well as play the game The game is very enjoyable especially with friends because some of the games can get very intense Overall the game is probably the best in the series because it made a major improvement over ESPN 2k5 Pros Graphics are the best of any basketball game on the PS2 to date Free throws more realistic in that you must have a fluid motion as if you were shooting the free throw yourself VIP is very extensive and detailed to show your stats and tendecies which is a very nice touch to those that pay attention to detail such as myself Cons Steals happen way too often Very challenging to get 15+ rebounds Practice mode is still relatively useless other than to perfect your timing on your shot 
NBA Live 2006 vs NBA 2K6 So you re looking for an NBA game but don t know which one to get I shall sort through the good and bad offered in both NBA Live 2006 and NBA 2K6 Between the two I have played Live 06 and 2K6 I can honestly say NBA 2K6 was a better buy for me At 20 I ve had countless hours of some of the most joyous moments and some of the most frustrating However NBA 2K6 is more of an all around basketball game If you re good at offense and poor on defense chances are good that you won t win as many games as you might think But if you re only good at defense and horrible at offense you won t win much then either You basically have to play an even game altogether this is based on All Star level For fans of offensive minded games look no further than NBA Live 2006 The basic controls are straight forward and easy to get a hang of so there won t be any real problems for newcomers to the series such as myself The best aspect featured in Live 06 is undoubtedly the Freestyle Superstars My favorite team is the 76ers and to see Allen Iverson pulling off the moves he does in real life on a game is nothing short of a rush Another highlight is that when you re left wide open for a shot chances are extremely good that you ll drain it Whereas on 2K6 you still basically had to have a perfect release As for the overall look of each game I d say that NBA 2K6 steals that as well When you re looking at Allen Iverson or any other player for that matter there s no question who you re looking at He s got his tattoos his cornrows mustache everything NBA Live 2006 on the other hand almost tends to look childish at times Don t get me wrong the graphics and dunks are awesome to look at but as you re dribbling upcourt I can t help but think the player s arms are too long Of course that could just be me 2K6 also seems to have more realistic courts I could do without the shots of the fans though NBA 2K6 pros Fantastic gameplay The more you play the more you learn making it a game you can invest time in The graphics are great When you turn up the difficulty it ACTUALLY GETS HARDER NBA 2K6 cons Offseason on Legacy mode is kind of lame Too frustrating at times When the other team is on a run it s nearly impossible to hit anything other than a lay up Loading time is almost ridiculous NBA Live 2006 pros Easy for anyone to pick up and play Freestyle Superstars Commentary is a lot better than 2K6 Dunks are fairly easy to execute and make for some excellent highlights NBA Live 2006 cons Camera angle is horrible Far too offensive minded Almost too easy at times Fouls are called too liberally on you So there you have it a fairly unbiased view on each game If Live 06 were to drop down to 20 I d highly recommend it because in reality it really is fun to play But at 30 I m not sure if it s worth every penny Plus 2K6 has a great street ball mode in addition to the legacy mode so did Live 06 ever really have a chance 
A benchmark in the Star Wars line of games You know what I absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard I beat it on normal in one week And this was when it first came out when I was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen But anyway this game was so fun I got it the week it came out and that Christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it I have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old 
The Force is with this Masterpiece Graphically this game is a work of art The shiny surfaces glowing lightsabers and vibrant colors make this a winner As far as gameplay those you can even forget the graphics This gameplay is so good you could play it with terrible graphics and still have an aweseome time The score by John Williams is another highlight The music enhances the tension action and drama of this game Overall this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played 
Still Playing After All These Years This was the 2nd game I purchased for my Macs and it s the only one I still play It really is that good The story is original and well executed the voice actors are excellent and the gameplay is fun The graphics may not be state of the art these days but they are subtle and more believable when compared to many of today s games which rely overmuch on special lighting effects Some of the puzzles are frustrating but once learned you find they are really quite easy The jumping puzzles and chasms can result in deadly falls but hey who said the galaxy was a safe place Hone your force jumping skills And your other Force powers You ll need them The cinematics are well done and really carry the story forward as they segue you into the next level The John Williams score is used effectively If you like being immersed in the Star Wars universe this game is for you The game is based on the Quake 3 Arena engine so it plays really smoothly on any new hardware Even older iBooks like the G3 I had perform well enough to play Jedi Outcast On my PowerBook the game flies The multiplayer game is good with the standards Capture The Flag and other team play but it really shines in Jedi Duel where the fights are one on one with the winner remaining to fight the next player on the server This is pure Star Wars light saber dueling and it takes skill and finesse to be a good duelist if one doesn t use cheats that is I wish LucasArts would release more games like Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast Jedi Academy was good but was more like an expansion to Jedi Outcast Jedi Academy did pick up at the end though and the Dark Side ending leaves plenty of room for a new Jedi Knight game with Kyle Katarn hunting down his wayward apprentice 
An underrated Star Wars game Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series INTRODUCTION I ve pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars and as you may have guessed I m a fan of many of the games based on the series Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss when one succeeds it usually succeeds beautifully One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces released for the Playstation One and the PC Although the game itself was horrendous with a terribly choppy framerate and very poor level design it was something the world had never seen before a Star Wars first person shooter The sequel Jedi Knight cleaned up a lot of the problems and added in some new innovations And now the third game in the series Jedi Outcast has arrived Like previous games in this sub series it has gotten a multi console release Read on to see how it fares OVERVIEW Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first person shooter The game has a one player quest as well as several different multiplayer modes REVIEW To put it simply this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been While not perfect this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn the agent from the other Dark Forces titles The second Death Star has been destroyed but many Imperial forces still fight on so it s up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them The graphics are for the most part solid I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game Nothing state of the art but they re still pretty damn good Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber The single player mode is extremely entertaining and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package And you can save whenever you want to in the single player mode But of course the game isn t perfect Like earlier Dark Forces games the level design just is not that good Too many areas look alike and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into Likewise in many cases your objectives are unclear and some of the puzzles are a pain I don t know about you but I buy first person shooters to shoot people not solve puzzles Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design it took me over an hour just to beat the first level Another huge problem is availability Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game This is a huge problem since the game s limited control selections will often clash with what you re used to for this sort of game This game wasn t released on the Gamecube in very high quanitites so you re gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy and in my mind it s NOT worth that price Sad but true I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans just be warned that it s not perfect and it s hard to get a copy EDITION NOTES This is a good game but for some strange reason it just wasn t available on the Gamecube for very long Because of this even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game Still you should hunt it down if you re into this sort of thing OVERALL Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub series thusfar Where the game succeeds it succeeds beautifully I am impressed with the game it s just a shame the Gamecube version was not made readily available to all would be players I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan 
3 years later and three years later I buy the game Wow Awesome I can t believe it runs so well after the three years of its release Everything looks and feels great on my XP This is one of the only games I have purchased and and not had to return due to the CD being messed up or some corrupted file So I m happy I thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on Yep this is a game I would suggest to any gamer 
I dont play racers much but this game IS GOOD I liked SSX series sequel 3 being the best but I didn t play racers I bought first NFSU and disliked choppy animation I got part two just out of curiosity and I liked it so much I beat the game Basically you are newbie in Bayview City and you race different type of races and build rep and your car You must tune your car for each type of race and you must check shops frequently There are various shops from visual effect and paint shops to ones which improve your car speed handling etc Races are also different you have races on isolated tracks races in live trafic Street X races in confined and cramped space without nitro option with lot dirty driving and hitting short tracks in which you win if you shift the gear in time and my favorites drift races in which you win if you get most points not if you pass the line first Drift races are won by breaking and steering in order to make long trail I used automatic shifting and I set game difficulty to easy since I don t play racers I was about 93 percent and I got into race which was unmarked on map It was 6 circuit race against boss and that was final one SOME ADVICE FOR BEGINNGERS If you can t find races on map go to garage and check out world map option and you ll get list of all races per level If you beat them and can t find any more races upgrade your car or get some stars on visual rating by getting cosmetics new parts like spoilers lights new paint and you ll get an offer for magazine cover or DVD If you are still stuck cruise the town to find unmarked races 
Great Game This is one of the best racing games I have ever played You can do so many modifications to your car 
Clarification on Xbox Dvd Kit Purchase the xbox console and dvd movie playback kit that matches the region in which you are located After you buy the dvd kit and put the dvd infrared sensor into your xbox the dvd kit permanently codes your xbox based on the region that your kit is from the region code of the dvd kit is only written on the outside packaging of the kit From that point forward you can only play dvd s from the region that the xbox dvd kit is from and ofcourse dvd s carrying the label all regions You cannot play dvd s from another region even if you later on try using a dvd kit from that other region on your xbox For instance if you are in the US and have a region 1 dvd kit and you import a dvd from abroad say having region code 3 it will not play on your xbox console But here s how you can change the dvd region on your xbox to play it 1 Send your xbox console for a repair to have it re adjusted to play dvd s from the desired region You will have to pay for a repair here even if your xbox is still in warranty period 2 Next buy a dvd kit sold for the desired region to use after your xbox console is repaired From here on in you can only play dvd s from this region and ofcourse dvd s carrying the label all regions It is is a permanent change Thus your xbox console acts like a region specific dvd player rather than a region free dvd player But all said i have no problems with the dvd kit I have a sony dvd player but i find the picture clarity better on xbox all the above info was procured from xbox customer care department To this end i hold that it is correct 
Works Great All of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy TV s I mean it could be that I have a 20 inch Sony Trinitron and the Halo special edition XBOX too but I have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends in real life or anyone in my CounterStrike Clan on XBOX Live that have old TV s and regular XBOXes RECCOMENDATION If the picture is crappy buy a new TV 
Good Challenging Game This isn t your typical run through game you actually have to think and take risk at times It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that s the thing I like most about it I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy My only flaws were the default controls those were a pain I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn t that bad This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels like Level Skip because it gets pretty tough but I didn t have to do that much maybe twice Anyways this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there 
Great star wars title This is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging don t listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard the people who claim it s to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get s to the point where you want to throw the game out the window This is a good game and I highly recomend it to and star wars fan p s don t buy jedi academy that game is horrible what a shame to ruin the series like that 
tHiS gAmE rOcKs I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer Back then I had a really slow computer and it didn t work right I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years Now I have a better computer and play it all the time The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult not so The guy must have obviously been a moron and not been able to figure out the puzzles because the game has an average difficulty and if he wants it easier he can play on Padawan Anyway the game is basically a first person shooter based game where you go around blasting storm troopers probe droids and more I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it and I want to get it for XBOX too 
Dumb Boring And Extreamly Hard I think its safe to say that this game sucks Before I got this game I thought it would be great I had heard so many good things about it Once I got it though I realized that this game wasnt as great as everyone said it would be The Graphics are ok but the gameplay and sound dont impress me at all Plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes As for all the talk about you being able to use the force the force is pretty weak in this game You also dont get the force until level 7 and on some of the missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning push pull ect Really the only good force power is grip Grip allows you to choke people Another thing that sucks is that there are different powers of the force so when you finally get the force you have to build up your power of the force for a few levels wich could take hours to finally get your force power strong enough to kill the enemy not just wound him This game is also EXTREAMLY hard Its like Metroid Prime were you can get lost and it ll take a long time to find your way around If you still want to get this game after reading this review is suggest renting it first Dont Be Dumb like me and buy it without renting it I wasted 50 
It was green now blue This game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time s but when you get all your force power s it is SO F ING FUN you can cut everybody s arm s off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool 
The Ultimate Star Wars Game Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base with no force powers But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game With amazing graphics and increddible duels this game is simply magnificent Plus the multiplayer is awesome especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you ll never want to trade in Plus the duels are fun to play again and again I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own any shooter fan really has to have and if you like both oooh you need it really bad 
Good graphics but the game was too simple and too short I do like Creature of Kapu Cave better than Danger by Design While I appreciate the quality of graphics sound effects and music it seems like the producers of the Nancy Drew games have changed hands in recent years We re seeing a stark difference in the newer games compared to their past games such as Shadow Ranch Danger on Deception Island Treasure in Royal Tower etc Those games are fantastic With the recent games play is not as fluid the tasks are too simple minded there s not much mystery or suspense if any and game play time is too short In Creature you can collect shells and make necklaces and you can go fishing for as long as you want to Or until you get bored with it The beach and water graphics are cool There is some humor with some the character conversations I enjoyed that You get to move between four locations that intertwine and make sense I didn t see any problem with the auto switching via cell phone calls between Nancy and the Hardy Boys That was not a problem for me I almost rated this a 3 star but gave it 4 due to the graphics characters and variety of locations Hopefully Her Interactive will hear their customers disappointments and revamp upcoming games Fans do want the Nancy Drew games to keep coming 
I like how idiots complain about this game The introduction ISN T boring it ISN T long and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix SE If you don t like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 1 then don t buy another RPG for as long as you live RPGs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different If you don t like it take it back and get a refund don t play RPG s like this if you can t stand words Go play some GTA or something oh wait theres words in that too 
Mediocre Story but Fun Gameplay In truth there really hasn t been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993 Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings and Children of Mana is no different Why did I buy it knowing this For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games There s always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did Unfortunately Children of Mana does not do this It doesn t rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us but that shouldn t suggest it falls short of it either The world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages It is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you ll set out to save the Mana Tree and the world itself Children of Mana by no means has a great storyline going for it At least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay No matter how you look at it Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler It is an RPG but it falls into the dungeon crawling category When you enter dungeons they re just swarming with monsters and you ll be surrounded before you know it So you ll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss take him on and then you re done Rinse and repeat The process does at times become annoying but Children of Mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it The first tidbit of interest is how combat works It s actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things It s surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours You ve got three hit combos you can perform on enemies You can knock enemies into other enemies There s quite a bit of intersting things you can do However what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can t ahead of yourself too fast First and foremost you can t equip and use everything you find right off the bat The game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations This keeps the game from being too simple You ll also have access to magic of course Each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you It s interesting to play around with as well In dungeons you can also dual wield weapons although not in the way you d think When I say duel wield I specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time So you can t go about swinging both of them at the same time which probably would ve added more variety to the gameplay otherwise Along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities It s interesting but not really all that deep You ll mostly find or purchase these gems Another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer Children of Mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on and they re actually pretty well worth it The problem with the gameplay however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast The objective in just about every dungeon is to find what s called a Gleam Drop and then bring it back to the Gleam Well It s annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way Fight through a horde of enemies retrieve the Gleam Drop fight a boss and leave Over time it becomes increasingly repetative However Children of Mana has a great remedy for that too It s multiplayer Up to four players can play at a time and the game is so much more fun that way You and your friends can make your way through dungeons together and sometimes it s just a blast to do There are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode but it s nothing to get too frustrated with because it doesn t happen too often The multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay As far as graphics go the game doesn t look too bad The sprites look like they re ripped straight ouf of Sword of Mana and the game is completely 2D However the Mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit they ve been about its unique art style which in Children of Mana is absolutely gorgeous It s artwork is just beautiful to look at Each environment is given extremely good detail The only problem as I mentioned are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed Musically Children of Mana sounds fantastic It s one of the best sounding DS games out to date Very few of the current games hold a candle up to it s fantastic soundtrack The bottom line is simple Children of Mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline There s just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with However keep in mind that Children of Mana really is just a dungeon crawl and it s uncrealistic to expect an RPG that s all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away On the whole if you re looking for a game that s fun you ll find it with Children of Mana However if you re looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters you won t find it in Children of Mana The Good +Beatiful Artwork +Fantastic Soundtrack +There s a lot of variety to the gameplay +Multiplayer is a blasts +Tons of sidequests to do The Bad The storyline isn t good The gameplay has a lot of vareity but it s hard to get past the fact that it s repetativ 
One of the Best Video Games Ever Made Katamari Damacy is one of the best games ever made It s also the freshest game Don t let the kiddie theme deter you this is extremely playable for anyone The music has very good genre recordings some of them are accoustic jazz studio recordings in Japanese but the jazz sound is there especially in Gin Tonic Red Red Roses which is a noir ish 15 minute scat vocal swing track with percussion piano double bass and flute The game has a two player mode which is set in an arena as a competition to see who s better The one player mode is the story driven mode about the King of the Cosmos father of your protagonist who is a little green guy that looks similar to a Teletubby The objective is to use the two analog sticks to make the character push around a small ball inside a garden or the rooms in a house or both into objects normally found in those three dimensional environments such as pairs of scissors mice golf balls flowers paperclips dining chairs spoons anything and everything The rolling of the ball has a snowball effect which means the more things your character rolls up into the ball the larger the ball becomes There s a big transition moment in the game where after rolling the ball around the rooms of a house the character breaks out of the house down the driveway to a farmer s market on the other side of the street where he starts rolling in watermelons until the ball gets even larger and rolls in bicycles little kids and then adults The game play is a surreal fantasy but it all comes together in its finale with an abstract epiphany that the world is a small enough place to understand each other when replacing the unnecessary with the meaningful The more I played this game the hungrier I got and the ending surprised me with an epiphany It s by Namco who as you know is the Japanese company that produced the original Pac Man arcade game Since then it has produced several genre games for Sony s Playstation including the Soul Edge series Soul Blade and Soul Calibur the Tekken series the Ridge Racer Rage Racer series and the Ace Combat Air Combat series all of which has been prime landmarks in that console s history This game is so fresh it struck a blow to me Strangely it is one of those Japanese releases that almost didn t make it over to America When it was brand new its list price was only 20 most games are 50 upon release The raving critical success and the sleeper hit popularity of this game garnered a sequel but I haven t played it yet At any rate it just may continue on as one of Namco s great series if it maintains the inertia of this original one 
Very Fun What can you say for Katamari Damcy except for it s exciting original fun edgy I totally recommend this for any video game fan that love games on the edge of something different new P S Don t delete this game when you are done because you will need to convert your progress to We Love Katamari 
Fun Game But Some Parts Take Too Long This is a pretty cool game that kills off the lonely boring hours of my life but I feel that some of the levels have too long of a time limit Not that I can finish them that quickly but I think they should be designed to be shorter levels For instance I think the Make the Moon level gives you 25 minutes to complete it Well that s just great if I have 25 minutes to kill but that s quite a bit of time to just sit down and space out the world while I roll junk up into a ball So like 10 tries on that level kills off 4 hours of my life which gets me closer to my sweet sweet death but sometimes I like to have my playtimes in shorter fixes For those times I play Zuma but I wish I could play a shorter version of Katamari 
Great Game when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games I new i wanted it My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on 
Fantastically Bizarre Unlike any other game you ve ever played in the best possible way I am easily bored and or grossed out by the traditional racing shooting killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change Challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time Other reviewers have said it ends too soon but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score So if you barely beat the level you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water Perfect for a pair of obsessive compulsives like my fianc� and me He thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than I do AND his 6 going on 7 year old son loves it too There isn t anything that would be inappropriate for any age but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn t get it After he goes to bed we play the insanely gory Jaws game you get to be the SHARK You might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast but the King of All Cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises The levels just get cooler and cooler Also the music is fantastic It will have you singing along in no time Na na na na na na na na KATAMARI DAMASHI It doesn t even make sense but I love it I just ordered the second Katamari game We Love Katamari Nuff said 
Almost as weird as a Japanese Vending Machine Specifically recommended by X Play on TV ABSOLUTELY agree that the recommendation was good I rolled my eyes at my wife when she wanted to spend 19 bucks on this game and I think I actually called it totally retarded She let me play it first and within 3 minutes I was hooked She s not allowed to play it because it s MINE ALL MINE Yes I m 29 years old and she STILL can t have it I d recommend this game to anyone NOT looking for an advanced game requiring weeks of play and advanced storyline If you like Tetris but want a little more variety and just a little more skill requirement and a good laugh this game is for you There s something oddly satisfying by rolling over the dog and seeing his legs twitter in the air when 5 minutes earlier he was pushing you around WEIRD Yes FUN Yes I d say good for 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won t appreciate how strange and cool this game really is 
Eye Toy is the Kix of video games There used to be a cereal called Kix that had a jingle Kids like Kix for what Kix has got Mom s like Kix for what Kix is not Eye Toy with Play2 is the Kix of video games I am the parent of a six year old girl Like many parents I was worried about getting a video game system for my daughter given the prevalent headlines about kids not getting enough exercise Then I saw Eye Toy advertised and I thought it could serve as a means to keep my daugther active but still allow her to participate in video game activities which kids love I bought Eye Toy with the Play 2 video game and I couldn t be happier with the results My daughter loves the games They are very inventive and if you ve seen the advertising you already realize that the Eye Toy camera puts the player s image right in the middle of the action The system doesn t work perfectly but close enough to simiulate activities from cooking to kung fu The game format also allows for fun head to head competition which is great for kids parties etc The best part is my daughter works up a real sweat when she plays the games The games have her jumping diving dancing punching and kicking She gets great exercise and has a lot more fun than if she was just sitting there The games aren t just for young kids either Kids up to young teen age years seem to enjoy them too For that matter I enjoy them but I m not worried about appearing cool We also bought my daughter the Sega Superstars disc for Eye Toy Those games are geared for older children but there are a couple which my daughter loves too Overall I couldn t be happier with how this experiment turned out I really hope more people become aware of Eye Toy s benefits because I think they are a great solution to a vexing problem Maybe Eye Toy should buy that old Kix gingle P S One thing the Eye Toy should come with is a lamp Buy one of your own we use a desk lamp with flexible neck to make sure the area the player is in is very well lit If not the camera has a difficult time seeing the player and the results aren t as good 
Best game for kids money can buy I bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys They play this game NON STOP basically until they re completely worn out The game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months If your kids have a PS2 then this game is a must have 
Hey Ho We re not gonna go So these little fellas are inside my computer They run around all day shouting Doodlee doo Doodlee doo I m thinking that they re up to no good I m thinking that they re plotting against me But I can t turn them off They say if I do then evil will befall me Caution Beware 
Very novel idea One of the more interesting video game ideas that I ve seen in a long time The Japanimation style is very cool and the gameplay is very engrossing Using the stylus pen to perform medical procedures is shockingly addictive and frequently very challenging 
kind of hard but fun I bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds The beginning went well the operations are fun The story drags a little and goes too slow i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations The operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful i am stuck on the 6th one i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now but continuously fail Unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further 
DS + jobs= good TEH HELL This is a really fun game It s got quite a lot Graphics length characters story Graphics 8 10 Dayum Reminds me of Dating Sims But nice The characters are crisp and have the special ingredient known as anime eyes Sound 7 10 The voices or lack of are nice The scolding of the nurse is kinda funny The music isn t that nice Theirs only about 4 different music thingys and I only liked one The one that plays when doing normal GUILT Story 8 10 I wish I could ve done normal surgeries for awhile before encountering a super parasite thing based off of the 7 deadly sins Controls 9 10 It s the DS Touch drag touch again Pretty simple Overall 9 10 A nice game that s easy to understand and hard to master But this is NOT a game for kids The blood isn t that bad and there isn t that much gore but it is a very hard game to beat And there s a suicidal patient which my mother didn t really like =\ 
Inventive and fun Of all the games on the DS no other third party title has made this good of use of the stylus and touch screen than Atlus Trauma Center Under the Knife Playing as a young inexperienced surgeon you use the stylus to cut suture bandage and more in an effort to save your patients You have a certain amount of time to do these tasks as well as keeping an eye on your patient s vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards and re starting the heart of a flatliner There s a storyline to Trauma Center but it s only here as a way to make the game move along The highlight of the game and what makes it worth picking up is the fact that this is one of the titles that makes the DS the best portable system out there today The level of interactivity is inituitive but the game loses steam because it is ultimately too short After completeing each surgery you ll be able to re play them to boost your surgeon rating which is a nice little bonus in itself All in all Trauma Center Under the Knife is a definite must check out for all DS owners but keep in mind that the game isn t for everyone 
Wonderful and Delightful Quite simply it s great though a bit on the challenging side Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it s rated E for everyone approach will appeal to adults as well as kids It s not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad Ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up Replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a touch list If you like adventure titles like Phoenix Wright and Trace Memory or Maniac Mansion for that matter then you ll really dig this game A good solid four stars 
Touch Detective This is a fun game to play I am on the 2nd mystery to solve I do love these types of games This one is sort of like Trace Memory alot of reading to do in it I am an adult woman My 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though 
It is worth it for the Game Boy player alone and maybe Super Smash Bros Melee One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA GBC and GB games on an external source a television a projector a 5 universal screen etc I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that Then afterwards I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch The system itself is cube shaped hence the name GameCube Like the original Xbox it comes with four controller sockets and the controller is similar in appearance but smaller and no it is not better than the PS2 controller Like the PlayStation 2 it uses memory cards to store data Unique to the GameCube is a handle on the back of the unit making it easier to carry Furthermore it can be purchased in a variety of colors platinum black and purple Other colors can be imported though I would recommend finding a store that does paint jobs I m giving this an 8 3 10 but that s only because as a North American I can t help but feel somewhat cheated For whatever reason when it comes to video games and their machines the US dwellers are always deprived of really neat things like Panasonic Qs GameCubes with built in DVD players GameCube Game Boy player bundle deals PlayStation Xs NES Axe Colors Tri star adapters Game Boy hunters the availability of systems in multiple colors etc Interestingly enough I ve found this problem to be prevalent with mostly the Nintendo and Sony systems Whoever said life isn t fair sure wasn t joking If the Panasonic Q had ever been released in the US and if this system had at lest been available in more colors here without having to import an unnecessarily tedious complicated and excessively costly procedure by the way then this probably could have gotten something closer to the 5 star range but with all due respect one would think that Nintendo would start showing a little more consideration and respect for us Americans than that The KAB score 8 3 super 
Fun For the Family I am the mother of four I have three boys ages 2 4 6 and a little girl age 3 This game has been fun for all of us You can play up to four players and the game is fun to watch as well as play My older boys have had so much fun playing this game for hours and hours We ve won the game countless times and started over again from scratch The game has many levels and lots of tasks to do The graphics are great and the challenges are fun My four year old has a little trouble with some of the harder parts but my six year old is able to take the lead with ease Great game for family fun cheering each other on and playing a game with the familiar faces of characters they love in the movies It s a bonus that with each level the four characters change to make it more interesting 
Great game My son has had many happy hours with this game It came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy 
Shut up you idiots I don t really review games because videogames are nothing much to talk about But anyway these obe star reviewers are all idiots Okay so sometimes idiots who play this game for ten hours a day are idiots also but that s not the point The people who write one star reviewers are all stupid fragile Hilary Clinton Supporters ans support that stupid dumbf jack thompson Freaking imbeciles Okay now this game rules This game kciks beacuse I can do anything I want If I want to race a car blah blah blah I just wanted top get myu point across to the one star reviewers If you don t have this get it I don t care how but get it Remember that most people who write crap probally actually never tried it or stupid like Jach Thompson 
One of the best classics period Let me say that yes this game is too violent for kids but beyond that it is totally awesome The graphics are better than those found in San Andreas and I enjoy robbing the stores greatly You will also notice that your health and armor will decline more rapidly in this game than in SA Ok so it does not have three super detailed cities but it has one nearly perfect city Vice City is the perfect parody of 1980s Miami and the missions seem to be pretty reflective The storyline is about what you would expect but the voice over acting is exceptional for a videogame The two main characters Tommy and Lance sound better than the characters in most major motion pictures I started my adventures with GTA San Andreas but in fact I am enjoying this game even more For anyone who liked either GTA III or San Andreas pick this up and by the way avoid Lib City Stories it is just too dull after a while 
The GREATEST GTA installment This is my First introduction to the Wolrd of GTA and I Loved it I ve played GTA 3 but it was not as fun as Vice City due to the Voice Actors included in the game which gives the game life I wasn t a VERY big fan of American Music since I only listen to Japanese but this game made me like them bit by bit Even though it has some glitches in the game I still prefer this over ALL GTA series 
Classic PS2 Game Despite all of the controversy over its violent content the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck In my opinion Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the best game out of the series so far Yes the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas but Vice City is a better overall experience The setting is beautiful there are more properties that you can own and the automotive firearm and weapon selections are also quite large The soundtrack to this game is amazing From 80 s pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio its all here Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun challenges and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package 
One of the best RPG s ever I d have to start off saying that Morrowind has been one of the most unique RPG s I ve played It s been at least as immersive and engaging as Baldur s Gate 2 or Planescape Torment The developers accomplished what they wanted to to make a game where one can do as he she pleases There are countless ways to play through this game Playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character The world is huge and it takes hours upon hours to explore There s so much that if you don t stop and turn around sometimes you re bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave Now about some technical things I m running this game on a P4 2 53 ghz 768mb PC2700 memory GeForce4 4200 Ti GPU The game runs great at 1024x768 resolution with full shadows and distance Since the graphics are a little dated and I more than excede the recommended system I ve chosen to install sevaral mods which is another great way to keep this game fresh Most notably the Better Bodies Better Heads and Morrowind Comes Alive The first 2 make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic The Morrowind Comes Alive adds many more NPC s generic travelers to ones that have something to offer be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot at random places giving the game even more of an immersion factor Over all I highly recommend this game In fact I bought it to keep me from wanting to play World of Warcraft and it s worked 
Game cube memory card This product is excellent Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time Good perfromanc 
Great Workout If you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a PS2 I would recommend this video game 
I love this game I love this game It s not too hard for kids to play my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets and it s not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it s also cool so us adults can play as well I love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like Jesse James and the Jester etc The graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also 
SCE always quality Whatever product Sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a Top Quality Product and these sony memory card for PS2 is just the perfect exampl 
An awesome game I had heard of how amazing Final Fantasy VI was supposed to be So I thought I have to get this game even if to just fill out my Final Fantasy collection First off I will start with V I had heard from many sources that this game wasn t very good I in fact find it just as good as VI VI is just as good as I was expecting It s funny and has very memorable characters and dialog My only problem with the two games is that there is a bit of a lag The lag is not bad at all in V but is pretty noticable in VI While it was a minor inconvience to me most people may find it more irritating Don t get me wrong I don t think the lag is enough to actually mess you up but it can get a little annoying Overall I got two great games for the price of one bargain game I must say I am completely satisfied 
Arrived Quickly This product arrived quickly and in excellent shape Thanks for being a quality shop This product is hard to find in a store Thanks again 
Nice package This is a nice package of my two favorite Final Fantasy games Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy V Final Fantasy V has never seen release here and I feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original Japanese version Final Fantasy VI has been restored to its original glory in this version and it s a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original Final Fantasy VI title with Tina Terra in Magitek armor I highly recommend this collection 
Final Fantasy Anthology I love this game I had it for SNES and it is one of my favorite 
Good Fun Best fighting game I have played in a long time The characters are coo 
big superhero game fan This isn t much like the spiderman games that i m used to but it is definitely a lot of fun Good storyline for a fighting game The single player is challenging but beatable and uses most if not all the characters There are plenty of characters and most are different and have unique powers There are two versus modes against the computer or against a friend The computer is pretty easy to beat Each character has it s own pros and cons Another thing i like is that the character levels aren t the same anybody remember super smash bros In most games there are a lot of different people but they re mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end I actually got bored and a little dissappointed after playing this a couple of days but a little while ago i started playing again and it is awesome recommended for comic book fans 
Nancy Drew Rocks I ve done most of the Nancy Drew games now and a couple CSI and Law and Order games Nancy Drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than CSI I also had so many problems with bugs with the CSI and Law and Order games not so with Nancy Drew And a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me 
Nancy Drew I have played several Nancy Drew games and this is by far the best one I recommend this game to anyone 
Clue Chronicles The Fatal Illusion WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLUE CHRONICLES First off you may notice a couple of things 1 This is called Clue CHRONICLES 2 It is refered to as EPISODE 1 sometimes 3 It is a 1999 game with no sequel Why is this Well Clue Chronicles was from Hasbro Interactive and EAI EAI quit the gaming business and Hasbro quit computer games and was left with board games So the promising series was doomed If you enjoy this game I advise you to write into Atari Why Atari Well Hasbro was left with all their computer games They passed all the rights to Infogrames which became Atari So in the complicated and confusing Clue Chronicles Timeline the rights are held with Atari I will and if you like the game you should too write to Atari and ask for a sequel Now for the real review MY REVIEW Clue Chronicles follows the story of 11 unlucky party guests on a mysterious yacht owned by Ian Masque After he drops dead the mystery begins Did a box kill him So it seems Join the old cast Miss Scarlet Mr Green Mrs Peacock Colonel Mustard Professer Plum and Mrs White along with a new cast of characters including Marina Popov Julia Kell Sabata Martin Urfe and for a short time Ian Masque You are a detective Nobody has ever met this man is person what did he want with them and you There is an answer But you need to play the game to find it out With an airtight plot that doesn t stop even after the story ends you will be gasping for breathe at the heartstopping cliffhanger ending MY GRADES Story 10 10 Well thought out with an unexpected ending Gameplay 6 10 Minor Glitches that don t effect the gameplay but involve disappearing characters in the background Soundtrack 9 10 Music mostly fits the scenes VO 9 10 The voiceovers are great except for one small part towards the end Graphics 8 10 Its an old game that about sums it up no FINAL A Will always be a favorite 
Will work for XP This is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game This game works with XP however you need to have a combo drive that includes DVD writer C D Combo writer I have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly 
This is the coolest mystery game made This is a great game for puzzel lovers and isn t easy This is a great game to play on stormy dark night Sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save Just when you think you have it figured out something new happens Even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time Trust me you will never be bored 
Clue Fatal Illusion I dont know what everyone else s reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome The graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful There s a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it The ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours not all at once of course to solve this mystery It s a really great buy Andre 
very fun game i really liked this game Im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game ALL THE TIME i dont why I WOULD BUY IT IF I WERE YOU VERY FUN CHALLENGING AT THE SAME TIME 
Kid mastermind This game took my 9 year old son 2 days to complete It was a disappointment since I paid 30 for it but the action adventure games make younger kids to make wiser decisions Overall this game deserves an A+ Not an adult type game but fun for kids 
Incredible Incredibles I love this game My daughter and I are big Ratchet and Clank fans and look for games with similiar play We found that in the Incredibles game It s exciting and challenging As we get playing it I wonder if it is too easy at times but then I get to a spot that I can t accomplish until I do it 10 times My favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as Mr Incredible you then get to be Mrs Incredible Dash Violet etc Great fun 
Top 3 PS2 game ever This game is simply awesome I received it for a gift last Christmas and I still love it The graphics action are amazing it s not available on XBOX If you don t already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece You ll love it The main character Kratos reminds me of Quan chi in Mortal Kombat Looking forward to God of War 2 
From the video game widow s point of view My husband brought this game home and I thought Oh no I guess we re not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game I caught myself saying Baby aren t you going to play your game This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I m tempted to try it out Everyone not shocked by gore and I mean LOTS of gore should play this game Every game should be this well made 
The best slash and hack game for PS2 ever created It s worth playing and spending hours of playing Warning This game is rated Mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids Nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc No need to buy the walkthrough because the game it s not really that difficult Can t wait for God of War 2 that will come out 2007 which luckily for PS2 instead of PS3 
This is for the new slim PS2 Just so everyone knows I mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who wouldn t be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind And don t even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this 
You ve got to be kidding The games are released as is and for an as is product you should beable to get it as freeware or the amaturish remake Even the DOS BOX emulator that comes with it cannot be opened without a file which you must risk downloading from a third party site rar files do not open by themselves you know Like Vivandi Microsoft is too chincy to develope internal download programs for this job as easily as they could Vivaldi compounds this afrustration by not even putting the install program in for the job You cannot run these games with out the emulator and you cannot use the emulator as it is unopened and zipped up thighter than Paris Hilton s jeans four stars for fun of confounding waste of time trying to config it without getting a virus two for crapola quality of compatiblitiy and it requires XP despite not being able to work IN it Also King s Quest 6 does not include the enhanced windows version which has the better grapics in portraits and animaetoins Who works for Vivandai again 
Didn t fix all XP issues I am a huge fan of this series When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy However King s Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release However when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY I could not believe this The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn t even do that properly This was a known problem and they didn t even fix it This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future 
Nice to have these games Amazon com has listed this as the King s Quest Compilation instead of the King s Quest Collection which is clearly printed on my box for the game as well as the picture on the website I don t know why that is As for the game itself I remember loving the King s Quest games when I was younger I bought this game mostly for King s Quest VI which so far has seemed to work fine with the exception of one time when the game kicked me out for no apparent reason This particular version of King s Quest VI also seems to draw it s graphics from the original release of the game and not the CD release later on so that was also somewhat disappointing Captain Saladin no longer looks like Lassie Overall it s nice to have access to these games for nostalgia 
where is King s Quest 8 King s Quest games are classic but why are they not including King s Quest 8 Mask of Eternity I know that it was not well received when it came out I personally liked it But just because it was not well received they won t include it It s part of the series and should be included as well 
There is no substitue for excellency These games represent glory days in the age of computing Like classic movies they will ALWAYS have a place and be replicated though never duplicated Let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IN ALL CAPS CALL ON VIVENDI TO GIVE THOSE INCREDIBLE DESIGNERS OF THE SILVER LINING FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL SUPPORT 
Highs and Lows While I think some of the reviews of Xenosaga II are a little harsh they have hit on a few good points In terms of plot the first thing that really let me down was KOS MOS Don t let her face covering the cover of the game fool you While being one of the main characters in the first game she hardly does ANYTHING in this game until the end which seems less like a plot point and more of the creators obliging her The same can be said for Shion as well This shift from center stage hurts these characters and it s really disappointing Instead Jr takes center stage Instead of shedding light on events in the first game it opens up a whole knew set of issues that really don t get resolved If you re looking for the story pull that the first game had it ll be hard to find in this game Jr is a character that I personally don t care much about but if you are a fan of him then you ll enjoy this game as you learn a lot about his past as a U R T V A new character that is introduced is Shion s brother Jin Uzuki Personally I liked Jin but you don t get to use him much in the game With him Shion Jr and Albedo there is an underlying theme of brothers or siblings in the story although don t look for much elaboration on Jin and Shion Although some people aren t pleased with the battle system in this game I actually enjoyed it I caught into it quicker than the first game s system You can also acquire a skill that points out the enemies weak zones which I found very useful I also liked being able to build up attacks and then boost to really slam the enemy Overall it s a game I really enjoyed The game has some replay value to it and there are certain things that you actually can t accomplish UNTIL you ve beaten the game once At times re watching certain scenes over and over again gets boring Yet I would recommend this series as if nothing else it serves as a bridge between the first game and the upcoming third game 
Fan of the Xeno series You ll love it New to the game Very good game try it Simply put Xenogears + Xenosaga 1 is the absolute best storyline and best role playing experience on the PS2 to date I do strongly believe that Xenosaga 2 has the best storyline in any RPG I have ever ever played including Final Fantasy 7 Xenogears and hundreds of others Because RPGs are strongly reliant on storyline for gameplay I consider this to be the pinnacle of Role Playing on the PS2 Final Fantasy X comes close as does Star Ocean but in terms of storyline this game beats them However I did have to mark down for a few other minor flaws This game is highly a niche game only for those who enjoy the style and the sci fi setting It s also very short 20 hours if you play straight through no leveling up Maybe 38 42 hours if you take up the side quests and want a strong character Gameplay The first Xenosaga highly relied on cut scenes and narrative In fact I absolutely could not stand the battle system Xenosaga Episode 2 still relies heavily upon that storytelling through hours of cut scenes but it fixes the battle system The battle system is simply put one of the most fun turn based systems I have ever experienced While Xenosaga Episode 1 s battle system seemed slow and unwieldy Episode 2 has a fast paced action packed and highly challenging battle system You have 3 characters on the screen at just about all times these characters can be switched off in a manner much like FFX but it costs a turn in this game causing it to be more tactical Each turn you have many options you can attack more on various attacks later stock save a turn for the next turn in order to get a combo use ether read magic or change your battle party If you choose to attack there is a whole slew of options here as well Most importantly is learning the weak points of the enemy Every enemy including bosses have a certain attack combination that will be most effective against them When you attack you can press either square which is a B zone attack Triangle which is a C zone attack or circle which is another B zone attack Certain characters also have an A zone attack but this is only against flying opponents You must expierament with the enemies in order to learn the zones they are weakest in Sometimes you may be required to stock for a turn in order to attack the enemy in its weak zone What is the advantage of attacking weak zones you ask Well it allows for large scale damage pounding comboes that are absolutely essential in this game Once you have hit all of the enemy s weak zones you can do a break on them This involves the circle button Once a character is broken they can be tossed into the air or attacked while prone on the ground This can add up to tons of damage if you plan your boosting right Boosting is another integral part of the combat system Pressing the R1 button brings up a 3 slot meter which is sometimes empty but it may feature the character potraits of some of your characters If you press R1 and then the button square triangle or circle that that character s potrait is on they will boost forward and immediately after the acting unit has taken its turn this new character will have a turn Enemies however can take advantage of all of these systems as well If you do not plan well or randomly attack without comboes the enemy will break you boost ahead several times and can easily destroy one of your characters in one short brutal assault Countless times my entire party was destroyed by simple enemies that should have been no problem merely because I did not plan ahead You will get very very used to seeing the game over screen The plus side of this difficulty is that you feel real exhiliration when you win it is a great accomplishment Note that even with power levelling it won t help you much in some situations believe me I tried Finally there is Ether Ether skills are basically magic if you know anything about RPGs at all then you know basically what is present here healing ether skills attack ether skills nothing big I forgot to mention the E S units These are basically mechs and were called A G W S in Episode 1 Many points in the game involve you using these to move around and fight and now they have an independant battle system It s basically the same as the one with your characters on screen except that you only have one attack a turn no comboes or anything like that It is just an added piece of fun to an already awesome game There is a skill system in place After every battle you earn class pointss and or skill points These can be spent on getting new ether skills or new upgrades to your characters that can make them more resilient when you equip them Every character has the same skill set and this is a minor flaw that slightly brings down the gameplay score but not the overall enjoyment in the least Finally one other flaw with the gameplay is that there are no weapons and no armor Both of these are RPG standard fare and it seems kind of odd to not have either This may just be something the developers decided not to do that I disagree with but it still seems a little odd Note that this really does not detract from the game in any way In Xenosaga 2 they also opted to add a lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 had The interesting thing is that these puzzles while challenging don t take away from the gameplay expierience at all In fact I found many to be very enjoyable The storyline of this game is simply incredible But keep in mind that it is basically required that you have beaten Xenosaga episode 1 if you want to understand it at all or at least be acquainted with the story in some manner If you haven t played it the best way is to get the bonus DVD that came with the game there are probably some somewhere around maybe even on ebay that allows you to see 4 hours of cut scenes from the original This can substitute in for those who dont want to spend the 60 80 hours required on Xenosaga episode 1 to beat it Anyway I digress Xenosaga 2 s storyline is more of the space opera fun Often times I got very emotional and the game can tug on your heartstrings In the ending sequence of the game a spectacular event lasting about 15 minutes I was seriously in tears This game can do that to you the storyline is that good It is also filled with entrigue betrayal new discoveries and new secrets It is truly incredible I have seen certain reviews that say the storyline doesn t solve everything it doesn t solve all the mysteries Let me tell you something it s not supposed to Xenosaga is going to be a 4 8 part series and the storyline is continuous It makes no sense at all to have the story be complete in only episode II I see no reason why anyone could possibly complain about it Graphics The graphics of Xenosaga 2 are basically the same as they were in episode 1 No real improvements at all They are still great though and the cut scenes are gorgeous My one real complaint here is that the lip sync is sometimes off a problem with just about every RPG with voice overs and some of the environments are a little dull This is made up for in the environments that are simply breathtaking Sound The soundtrack of Xenosaga Episode 2 is godlike From the opening theme to the battle music to the catchy Japanese sounding tunes that ring in your head forever this music is INCREDIBLE The voice acting is also absolutely superb I have zero complaints this is a rarity Sound effects are also very appropriate and very well done Value The game is hurt in the value department only because of its length To put it in perspective the first playthrough took me about 28 hours but more like 30 if you count all the times I died and had to go back to the point I got killed at After you win you can use your game clear file to access even more goodies like some bonus bosses dungeons and side quests and this helps make up for the shorter length Personally I think its the best 50 I have ever spent Tilt Finally the overall enjoyment This game is simply the most enjoyable game I have played on the PS2 I completed it after several all night gaming sessions and it will most likely keep you up too The Role Playing experience here is superb the storyline is possibly the best in RPG history and the battle system is incredible and in depth There is virtually nothing not to like As an avid RPG gamer I recommend this game as highly as is possible However there are a few things to consider can you handle the challenge and do you like the Space Opera Anime feel If you answered yes to both get this game 
Not as excellent as Xenosaga I but still good Xenosaga II Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga which was released here But we European players never played Xenosaga I before so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great Special Box In this box was the game itself and a Movie DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies Back to topic in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job with his elevator music o The graphics are okay but I couldn t see anything outstanding In the end I must say that Xenosaga II is a good RPG even if it s not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga That s the reason why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_ But at last the most PAL players are happy that actually my dictionary doesn t give me the right English translation for ueberhaupt _ sorry Xenosaga II come to Europe yet So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope that this Episode will be like the first Many greets from Germany Viele Grue e aus Deutschland ^ 
Short Lasting Realistic and Drawn Out This game matches with the real thing quite well but has too few questions to endure If you ve never seen the show it s simply a series of fifteen each increasing in dollar amount until the last million dollar question It s drawn out There s a speech clip for each dollar amount answer and other things The infamous quot final answer quot option only appears when you take a while to answer unfortunately The lifelines are realistic minus the fact that quot phone a friend quot is really quot phone Regis s friend quot The quot fast finger quot scrambles the choices and the first correct key pressed wins The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people but only those who won t run out of questions 
Dynamic fun This is a great game in which yoiu get caught up in the action It s almost as if you are there 
A FPS That Actually Makes Me Sweat I have played Call of Duty 2 through and through I have unlocked all the achievements and now I feel kind of sad I want more This game is simply fantastic from the graphics to the gameplay I actually felt like I was thrown back in time to fight the Nazi Fire fights and be intense since enemy units are not retarded They will use cover effectivly and will even try and get better postioning on you It may seem like no big deal but game developers have been promising smart AI for years and never deleviring until now I unfortunitly do not have the ability to play on Xbox Live so the muliplayer is very limited for me what I have play is fantastic Its not ground breaking and the lack of vehicles is kind of crappy but no big deal Okay if you have an Xbox 360 you might as well get this game Its the best I have played so far 
Awesome I really love this game I m not much of a gamer but I really enjoying playing this one both by myself or in multi player mode 
Enjoyable Challenging City Builder Set In Ancient Rome with a few bugs Disclaimer I am not employed by or associated in any way with the game s publisher or developer I am just another consumer I put that disclaimer because people have a tendency to point out all the positive game reviews here as planted by the developers That may be true in some cases but not here CivCity Rome is not without it s flaws The mouse cursor bug is a known issue on high resolution settings and the game developers have acknowledged this and will be releasing a patch soon How this slipped by their beta testers is beyond me but I ll agree with some others here it is nearly a game breaker That aside if you love things set in ancient Rome like me and if you love city builder CB PC games like me you ll absolutely love CivCity Rome Don t be fooled by the title the game has absolutely nothing to do with the Civilization series of games It is more like a blend of Caesar III and SimCity with a heavy influence of Stronghold II thrown into the mix I personally have spent many hours playing the game on medium difficulty and I find the interface and in game advisors extremely easy to navigate Some have stated the game s interface is clunky and hard to navigate I would love to know what game they are comparing CivCity Rome to because the interface is slick and very easy to use Graphically the game is beautiful to look at Those who say the graphics are dated are living in a fantasy world Just take a look at the screenshots Admittedly the graphics are not as pretty as those in the upcoming Caesar IV game but they are very well done especially on newer systems The tutorial and the manual were both very generous and well done the in game voice acting is charming and appropriate the gameplay is challenging and addictive and the learning curve is about what you would expect for any city builder I strongly suggest anyone interested in city building games and especially ancient Rome based games to check this game out It is well worth the 40 bucks and you ll get many hours of enjoyment If you have a high resolution monitor you may want to wait for the first patch though Cheers 
Amazon is it Quick delivery Product arrived on time and in excellent condition You have quality shipping Thank yo 
R Angus i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i don t think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun 
Square if this isn t one of the greatest games out there it s the best We ve all heard of Final Fantasy 8 and Final Fantasy 10 but does anyone ever mention the game in between Final Fantasy 9 is sadly the most underestimated game in the Final Fantasy series It s the one that pulled me into my FF fandom and though it s around 6 years old I still love it The reason it s not as famous as the others is probably because FF9 came out on the Playstation JUST before the Playstation 2 came out The storyline is spellbinding It captures you right at the beginning and flows beautifully through cities of eternal rain clashing monsters and the Traditional plot theme in almost every RPG alive fate of the world itself Everyone can relate to FF9 s characters who struggle to find who they are or where they belong and in the end find or almost find the meaning in a stunning finale Then you ll find yourself cheering for them or mourning over them if you become attached to one who dies The music Nobuo you ve outdone yourself FF9 s songs are masterpieces and you ll find yourself humming YOU RE NOT ALONE or MELODIES OF LIFE without knowing it And of course a couple pieces will bring back amusing scenes just by mentioning their name SLEW OF LOVE LETTERS anyone Any cons Hard question If there were a problem then I can t target it Perhaps leveling up your character may take a while but then again that s a traditional part of every FF Game so it shouldn t be counted And being able to play as a few of the legendary characters Fratley Beatrix would be great but that would take away their status wouldn t it And that s an opinion so I ll let it slide I can think about this until my head explodes but I won t be able to target an ACTUAL flaw I Lyrit find Final Fantasy 9 the perfect RPG game Overall and again this has got to be the greatest FF game out there I ve played most of the others popular in the series now but they just don t strike me like FF9 Wait What are you listening to ME for GET FF9 AND PLAY IT Once you do my review will look like it s degrading this game 
Not Square s Best But Better Than Most I LOVE Final Fantasy games They are the reason that I still have my NES and SNES This really does take me back to the early days of Square Admittedly I ve gotten older and my tastes have changed in the past 15 years I think its been that long since FF1 was released but this game just makes me smile Completing the Chocobo Side Quests making sure mognet gets back online defeating Hades and Ozma power leveling like a mad man laughing at Zidane for being as bad with the ladies as I am All in all the important parts of the game are what kept me playing Now I will say there are a few annoying parts You should never sell any equipment The Synth shop is a wonderful idea but for some items at the end of the game you need weapons that you got at the beginning of Disc 1 Also some weapons disappear from the face of the planet as you switch discs That little fact causes quite an annoying problem for those of us who like to see every ability fully mastered for every character if you cant tell I was the kid that spent 3 months in the downed Shin ra plane getting everyone to 255 stat points Overall this is an outstanding game It keeps me wanting to play it makes my chronic insomnia relapse and I love just watching Vivi dance during fights and watching Zidane get shot down over and over in the interim The Graphics of this game are simply beautiful Its not something that will ooooo and ahhhh you but if you give them a second look after you get over the cartoon like feel you ll notice that they someone took their time with this production Someone made sure every single detail was perfect FFVII felt 2D and while you knew the scenery was a 3D endeavor it felt like a 2D isometric drawing rather than a fully 3D rendered scene When you look at FFIX you KNOW you are looking at a fully 3D environment It was a really great thing to see especially on the PSX even though the XBOX 360 is now out Characters what can i say about the characters I love them They all make me smile I relate completely with Zidane s social life and then his story took me off guard the first time i heard it I wasn t expecting it and it made me want to play longer Garnet is interesting She is that naive girl we all knew in high school It just seems every character has their own story and it is pretty well explored really what do you know about Yuffie Zell Quistis and Irvine Do you ever wonder how Reeve controlled Cait Sith while he was talking to Scarlet and Heidegger I really do not have a lot of unanswered questions like that with FFIX just some things that could have been elaborated on like the summoner s village but all in all i think the story was pretty perfect My only BIG complaint and is the length of the game There is a lot of stuff to do but the end of the game can be reached in UNDER 12 hours 4 months of work to get a certain sword stay with Ragnarok if you are reading this saying I got Excalibur II is not worth the heartache This game gets 4 stars because while it is a good game I just wish there was more of it There s plenty of side quest stuff just not enough story time 12 hours of story is just about as long as Aeris stays breathing in FF7 Hope this makes your purchasing decision a little easier Its definitely a great game and heck if worse comes to worse it s a good time killer for a rainy weekend 
GREAT I bought 2 of these controllers for my kids because I didn t want cables in the middle of our Family Room nor did I want them sitting too close to the TV when they played This controllers are excellent They work perfectly they are easy to store because of the lack of cables the weight is fine for small children the range of the signal is more than enough and they aren t battery eaters I use them as well and they are wonderful They are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations 
A Ruler and I got the earlier design of this controller It was bigger and felt better than the regular dual shock The only down side to it was the analog sticks The top curves in like a bowl and not like a knob and has no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off This new controller does away with that problem and goes back to the old knob style analog sticks with more grip BUT it s the size of a regular controller now but rounded It does fit well in the hand and uses only 2 AA batteries This controller is great but if and when it does stop working like the other reviewers say I will swap out the analog sticks to my old logitech controllers a little altering needed 
great device but I have the same opinion as everyone else the controller is very convenient appealing affordable and fun but it suddenly stopped working i think there are some problems with the wireless connection and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and BOOM your controller stops respondind and you get killed IT SUCKS i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do what i do to solve it is changing the batteries and then putting them back again or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again that has worked for me it sounds silly but somehow works so if you want a great wireless controller this is it but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too 
Gamers everywhere can finally rejoice in knowing that wireless controllers aren t doomed after all I ve never bought a wireless controller before so I wasn t sure what to expect But it turns out this is probably the most comfortable video game controller in the world the Logitech Wireless PS2 Action Controller is every bit as comfortable as the DualShock 2 and then some It s a very curvy controller that fits almost too perfectly into the palms of your hands and the buttons are placed great The buttons never noticeably stick the full D Pad is Hundreds of times better than Sony s segmented D Pad and the analog sticks are EXTREMELY sensitive responding to the lightest touch and there are the start select analog buttons there 9though analog is called Mode on this controller and a new button that turns vibration on or off The placement of these four is good enough as you won t be using them often anyways Lag time is wonderful for this controller There is NO noticeable lag whatsoever The radio frequency causes NO interference and the reciever is small and barely noticable if not a bit dare I say it cute The controller s weight is excellent too It runs on batteries yet is unbelievably light The battery door does not stick out on the back uncomfortably either Your batteries will also last you from 50 300 hours with vibration on off You won t even know you re playing with it when you re in the middle of a violent gunfight somewhere It s just that good The size is also comfortable and barely larger than the DualShock 2 Plus there are no cords to trip over pull out of the controller slot or add to the mess of cords behind your entertainment center There is ONE small bad point about this The vbration feature is not as good as the DualShock s But there are just TOO MANY good things here about this controller that make it invaluable to buy even with this minor drawback The Verdict Guilty on the charges of being The most invaluable piece of PS2 hardware aside from the console itself in the world Sentenced to be bought by consumers around the world Case dismissed 
PS2 Cordless Controller My son loves this controller It fits well in his hands and has a similar feel to the regular corded PS2 Sony controller It doesn t have the same rumble feature but has a button to turn the rumble feature on and off Overall it s the best cordless that he s used yet 
Fast and great the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin 
Best cordless controller for ANY system From using only two cordless controllers this one and the XBox 360 s controller I like this one a LOT more It s comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light I couldn t ask for a better controller unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then I d find myself that much more pleased Buy this one there isn t a better wireless controller out there

One of the top 5 games I have ever played Make no mistake about it this game has more than a few bugs and sudden desktop crashes It is also one of the most immersive and totally enjoyable games I have ever played I am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds if not thousands of video games since the 70 s This game has it all as far as role playing games go One bit of advice about this game is save often save often save often Oh and one more thing be sure to save often 
Good As Gold This game rocks you ve got action storytelling quests your own path linear gameplay and the world is alive people have jobs and work times and play times The controls are a little quirky but worth the hassle 
LocoRoco Best PSP Game Clearly a Hit At TGS Tokyo Game Show 2005 Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP LocoRoco Instead of the usual ports or re creations or compliations of retro games LocoRoco is a completely new venture It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos yellow blobs and MuiMuis blue figures live One day it is invaded by the Moja Troop who eat LocoRoco Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten You collect flowers which gives you another LocoRoco You can combine and separate LocoRocos as well You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos Additionally when you collect MuiMuis you can get house parts The game is very easy As a PSP player of Tekken DR complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play especially ports that we re used to seeing on PSOne and PS2 With LocoRoco you use 3 buttons during gameplay The shoulder buttons LEFT and RIGHT are used to tilt tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos holding the circle button combines them and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump A lot easier said than done A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http www us playstation com locorocopcdemo You must have v2 71 for this to work I might add Besides a career mode which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos there are mini games like a Mui Mui Crane Chuppa game and more You must collect a certain amount of bugs pickories every game to play these games Also there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco I haven t yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature I presume By collecting MuiMuis in games you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco Besides all of the gameplay features a large soundtrack is full of bubbly interesting and catchy jingles with unique voices While some find it annoying it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on MuiMuis do as well The graphics are 2D like Mario which make loading times non existant and shows off the capability of the PSP s high performance graphics In the end LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive simple and beautiful to look at It is fitted only for the PSP and it should Additionally the gameplay is excellent pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters like Moja who attack you or Chuppa who catapults you into hidden areas It is clearly worth 40 clearly PROS Intuitiveness and Simplicity Easy to play fitted for the PSP Shows off PSP Graphic Capabilities Beautiful to look at Different Maps Characters Colors Very unique and fresh Not a Port or Re creation compliation A completely original game No Long Loading Times 2D graphics prevents this Mini Games Lets you take a break from main gameplay CONS Longevity Only 40 levels makes you wish for more Should ve Used Characters More Some characters pop up once You have to pay money made in career to access mini games 5 5 FUN 5 5 GRAPHICS 5 5 GAMEPLAY 4 5 PLAYABILITY 19 20 TOTA 
Innovative gameplay and music that sticks in your brain Two ingredients for a classic game Much like Katamari Damacy this game makes you play in a new way As opposed to games that really require additional fingers to play properly this one uses only three buttons the L and R shoulder buttons and the O With the shoulders you tilt the world so you can roll back and forth along the brightly colored landscape and with the O you spilt into little blobs and join back up again The levels are works of art each one unique It s a shame there s no hint book for the game poster size copies of each level would be a delight to see In Japan they actually posted the entire first level as a mural sized ad in subways The obstacles are as cute as they come not since the Mega Man series have villains been so cute and infuriating And the music oh god the music All gibberish so they didn t have to be translated and all adorable you ll be humming them for days This little diversion will dominate your life The replay value is infinite you ll spend days trying to get that last berry Mui Mui 
Fun Game i luv to play This game is awesome I love to play it and i play it everyday In school it gets me way far ahead and much quicker too at math The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out and sometimes it won t take your answer this happens sometimes but it kind of stinks because your getting tested so when it won t take it it counts it as wrong But i gotta say don t let this little thing stop you from buying this game It will kill alot of time On long trips i always take it and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds It totally rocks i used to get car sick because i was bored and just sitting in the car but now i don t get car sick at all because im doing something else This game has made me good and quick at math in my school It really helped This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it 
Brain Age Works I found this to be a fun game as well as effective I enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and abilty to increase my speed I particularly like it when it got to the level where I could choose which games I wanted to use for my brain age tests Several of the games are going to require more repetitions before I become skillful at them I find that I continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest Carole Adan 
good 1 player multiplayer ucks I baught this game because I was hopping for a good multiplayer first person shooter for the Wii But this was not the case the multipler is crap It is jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 I am more prone to multi player games like time splitters where you can all be on a time So i was pretty dissapointed The story is great though It really takes advantage of the Wii mote and has a great storyline I jsut wish it had a better multiplayer 
Please stop reading mag reviews and posting them here Maybe I m strange but I liked the game The only thing I didn t like is the zoom in feature I felt that could ve been handled by a button push like in COD3 The graphics remind me of Time Crisis 3 4 No blood I could careless Only kids seem to care about that stuff nowadays Can t seem to control your view Put your arm on your knee for support and tweak your controller some Bad AI Seems like it s always bad AI when most get their butts kicked I believe the AI to be above avg since it will advance on you flank you hide draw fire and such Yeah there are some glitches here and there but nothing to really whine about If you can t see the bad guys you probably need a bigger tv I was hitting this guys on my friend 13incher with no issues If you can t hit these guys you ll have issues in COD3 for the Wii as well Red Steel 2 is in the works so I m sure they will fix some these issues folks keep complaining about Give me online play some more options in multiplayer bump in graphics more weapons and a zoom button and I ll buy RS2 as well 
If you Don t like Red Steel you simply don t like the Wii I typically don t write reviews but being a gamer and seeing the negativity here I felt compelled to post my thoughts Red Steel is truly a fun game It definitely has its flaws but being an owner of 7 launch games I can extend that statement to every one I think it provides a truly unique experience and once you get a knack for the controls it becomes intuitive and nothing like you ve ever experienced before The ability to replicated sword movements and gun movements has kept me on the game for 2 days straight My personal opinion is that if you do not like this game you simply do not like what the Wii can do If this is your type of genre it s a must buy 
Simple yet deep Graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any RPG fan 
Fantasic Storyline Amazing Graphics a Must Have Final Fantasy is sometimes thought of as a kiddy game with chocobos and moogles Final Fantasy XII proves that this series can present an awesome storyline and graphics that all ages will adore Don t worry if you haven t played all of the other Final Fantasy games You don t need to There are subtle carry overs but this game is meant to stand alone You are a young orphan in a city recovering after a war The cruel Empire has taken over your home town and you enjoy causing trouble for the soldiers Soon of course you re swept up in an epic rebellion The storyline here is just amazing Not just the plot itself but the voice acting the dialogue the graphics they are top notch This is really like being a part of an extremely well done drama movie They delve into issues of honor loyalty love betrayal and more I m an adult gamer and I was staying up many long nights because I wanted to see where the story was going Some of the subtle interactions between characters in cut scenes are just amazing The small nods the looks in their eyes you are hard pressed to remember that they are animated in a computer game Gameplay itself revolves around a party of characters going on quests fighting in battles and moving through the large world Each character gains experience and skills as they go You buy them new weapons and armor train them in spells and aim them in their career growth however you wish There is a dual system in play here First you need to physically own the weapon or item you wish to use say an iron sword But then you need to KNOW how to use it too You can t just hand an iron sword to a 10 year old piano player and expect her to know how to use it That skill is called a license You have an online license chart that lets you manage what each character knows Licenses relate to each other If your character learns the basics of sword work now they can learn a more advanced version It is very intuitive and adds a fun element to the game It s not just one straight line that you choose and are stuck with It s an all directions layout where you can try new skills or expand out as you learn the system better I really like combat in this Final Fantasy as well Instead of random battles where enemies appear out of nowhere to assault you all enemies are on the map with you If you re running along a path in the desert and see something really scary in the distance you run away from it You don t have to worry about enemies springing up out of nowhere to slam you into the ground The enemies in general are challenging but not impossible There are spots where you really have to think about the enemy and what its weakness is to defeat it You can t just brute force bash away at everything and hope to succeed Still as great as the gameplay is and as gorgeous as the visuals and music and voice acting are I really have to come back to the plot and characters as standing out here There s been a lot of talk in the gaming world about a game that finally goes from little pixels on the screen that you move from X to Y to the point of caring about these characters about what they are going through and feeling emotional about their highs and lows I really think Final Fantasy XII has hit that level Yes there are one or two twerpy characters that can be annoying Even Star Wars had Luke whining about the Takashi Station at the beginning to set his basis for growth In general though every single character here seems real seems complex and you don t want to put the game down Highly highly recommended 
I m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse That s exactly what this game says to me I just couldn t refuse That s for 2 reasons I love the movies and the game is NASTY What a f in game man AWESOME I like it better than the GTA games and Scarface Maybe it s cause I m such a fan of the movie Maybe it s cause I m Sicilian But I love this game I haven t been glued to the TV like this since Devil May Cry 3 The controls are great Fighting and shooting are spectacular Easy to get a hold on The voice overs make it RIDICULOUS to listen to and watch especially in the cinema scenes Marlon Brando James Caan Robert Duvall The only thing is WHERE S AL PACINO I would have SWORN he d be in it Michael Corleone is nothing like MICHAEL CORLEONE That s my only real complaint WHY WHY WHY isn t he in here Anyway back to the pros The virtual New York City here is great The cars driving around the people walking the streets having conversation The fact that you can rob banks and trucks is sick Then there s the EXTORTION WOW I love running around extorting businesses I love the fact that you can do things however you like Talk to someone man to man or woman Smash up their shop Smack the owner around a little bit It s fun as hell The mob face is awesome I really think my character looks like me The guns are crazy ESPECIALLY the upgrades I got my guns all leveled up and they are RIDICULOUS The way you create your own character and you play a part in the storyline is fantastic It s taken me 40 hours to become Don of NYC and finish the game The only thing I have left to do now is find the rest of the film reels But basically it s taken my 40 hours to beat the game What the hell I ll start from the beginning again 
you talkin to me This game is great Both the missions and the things you do on your own like extortion make this game an awesome part of anyone s collection I only found one thing wrong with the game When you reach the rank of Don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel For instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble This game although great can still use a little fine tuning 
One of the best ps2 games around This game is very good They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool The game folows the movies well You can even blow up buildings The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave Lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops 
The Corleone Family wants to buy YOU out This game reminds me alot of the Grand Theft Auto series While it has many similar characteristics in the way you get around town go into buildings and the way you interact with the environment it still manages to offer a few original and interesting components to the gaming industry This game has a great storyline that fans will likely enjoy Even if you weren t a fan of the movie this game is still a must Like GTA there are a few side missions not as massive as GTA though there are collectibles and then you have main missions along the way While the object of the game is to take over New York some of the warehouses and businesses can get repetitive but its mostly all fun One plus is the police in this game tend to be less of a hassle unlike the GTA games This lets you keep playing rather than having to stop and restart at a safehouse or in the police station This helps speed up the game The controlls take time to get used to but after you play for a little while you are good to go If you like the GTA format style of play you will certainly like this Also if you like the Godfather the storyline to the game is great and really stays true to the movie While its not the best game of the year it will certainly do until a new GTA comes out It took me about 2 weeks to finish the game playing a few hourse each night I hope they can come up with Godfather 2 We will see 
When you re old enough and the time is right you will take your revenge You know it s been quite some time since I ve found myself glued to a videogame where in my mind hours become seconds I say to myself that I m only going to play for a few minutes fifteen tops next thing you know three hours have gone by The last game to do that to me was GTA San Andreas I thought there would never be another game that would hook me like that I was wrong Boy was I ever wrong The Godfather for PS2 is an addicting and gripping game that throws you into the world of the Mafia and links you to the classic storyline found in the film You play an older son with a score to settle Your father was wiped out by Don Barzini right in front of you when you were little Don Corleone tells you that when you re old enough you will take your revenge Now all grown up you aim to serve your Godfather and move up the ranks from an outsider to becoming a made man and then some If you re clever enough you might even become Don If you re ruthless enough to wipe out all of your enemies you can become the Don of NY The decision is up to you The game gives you the classic storyline that we all love and know from the movie only it involves you The missions will be very familiar to the famous scenes we have seen over and over again Not only that but in GTA fashion you are given a lot of freedom to do things on your own You can shake down rival businesses using various negotiation tactics Need some extra cash Rob a bank Better yet hijack a rival truck and steal the goodies inside You re given a giant world to interact with Whether you decide to play the missions straight through or do some freelancing many opportunities to enjoy the game are to be had The graphics are pretty impressive Players who are familiar with the GTA games will have an easier time getting used to the controls and the various camera angles The look and feel are very identical If you want my honest opinion I actually enjoy this game a lot more than any of the GTA games but that s because I m such a fan of the movie It s great that you get to relive your favorite scenes and be a part of the action Cons The missions can be tricky and sometimes even downright frustrating A good majority of them are timed so it may take you a few times to get a mission done just right I understand the timer in some missions but sometimes they get a little ridiculous and I feel that they re just trying to throw some unneeded obsticles in your path The good news is that there are tons of checkpoints for each mission so if you fail or die you will not have to start all over again Also the game can be glitchy at times Now I haven t seen anything major that disrupts my playing at all but I ve heard some people with earlier copies that had some major problems so be careful about that I could go on and on about this game but I m sure it s all been said before You want my verdict I love this game and think it s a blast to play The Godfather is bound to be a classic If you re a fan of the movie or the GTA games then give it a shot I have beat the game twice already and I still find myself playing it all over again more and more If you have no free time whatsoever then stay away This game will consume you whether you like it or not You have been warned The offer has been made Don t you dare try to refuse it if you know what s good for you Michael Cran 
GTA but BETTER This game is pretty much like GTA same sort of graphics same way driving same way shooting but the the better part is the fighting and how u can threaten people on the streets and scare them instead of just killing them This pretty much follows The Godfather movie story line For example Luca Brossi dies and Micheal leaves to Sicily One can create there on MOB face in the game which is really cool Then you get accepted in the Corleone family and even get to talk to the DON himself Unlike other games if your doing a mission with some character to help you that character doesn t die and kills people instead of just standing there My favorite mission is when your with Sonny taking over one of the enemy families warehouse The game is just great and amazing go and buy it 
Amazing at first and even more so in hindsight This game is literally the alpha and the omega of its genre The storyline was great the characters were really good the freedom and depth in the game was almost unbelievable Planes choppers bikes cars you name it Drug dealing gun running cop bribing you name it Even still this game had 2 or 3 pretty big flaws Namely that it is not great graphically but on a strong pc with a good graphics card it is hard to really complain What most bothered me is that on a half dozen or so missions the objective was so poorly phrased so that I ended up spending a few hours trying to do the wrong thing entirely I was flying the plane and trying to land it on a cliff instead of a hit a marker x thousand feet in the air The directions for the mission said take it to the cliff so I did Also some of the missions might take a lot of attempts before you succeed so have patience As lame as my last quasi complaint is I think the storyline could have been longer I wanted to see a few more missions where Carl and Wuzi have fun after the big heist and I wish CJ would have had a definite resolution with Catalina If anyone has not planed any of the GTA games before as I hadn t either then this game might overwhelm you and the first couple nights you will really hate it But if you do buy it be warned this game will take about 2 3 weeks of playing 6 8 hours a day if you want to get close to 100 completion and it is addictive 
Best game yet in GTA series I bought this game a bit late 2 years after It came out but it still seemed state of the art to me Loved the story and gameplay has improved significantly Pros HUGE MAP with 5 massave areas to explore TONS of vehicles you might not see the same one twice Cool new features like vehicle customization Endless stuff to do multiplayer mode Cons character customization prosess can be annoying If you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back ie all your muscle going down Go buy this game you will really like i 
Ver 2 0 is fun but serious modders beware FYI If you enjoy modding to spice up your GTA world and enhance replayability you DO NOT WANT TO BUY VER 2 0 Due to lawsuits over the hot coffee mod ver 2 0 was released with new code that prevents any mods from working If you want to replace the Banshee with the new Ferrari Superamerica or the Landstalker with an H2 you need ver 1 0 If you don t care about modding then sit back and enjoy the ride 
Great game runs perfectly If you liked Vice City you ll love San Andreas With more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better The games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash As a note I had NO problems running this game with pretty much all options on high I run a Dell 8300 3 0 HT 1 GB ram Radeon 9700 PRO and it flies Strap up and get ready to defend your hood 
A Gem This game while simple in it s storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square Enix First Square and Enix merge effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG s of all time Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy Now we have the perfect pairing of wit humor heart and pure Square story Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing The chains you can get going in Sora s attacks are amazing The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding To learn this battle style you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum The battle against Sephiroth one of the best known villians from the Final Fantasy series is awesome I never did beat Sephiroth but the battle was intense and I had him beaten to his knees several times The bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself This game essentially creates a new genre blending a soulful cast with characters from Disney lore The underpinning story is not to be missed be sure you get the extended ending by following the Brady Games guide The summons are a bit hard to leverage but Tinker Bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles 360 degree rotating battles with the Shadow King in the sky above London and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages The secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution 
One of the Best Games Ever I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out My initial thought was what was Squar thinking I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people right before KH2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the 20 to get the game as was the price of the game by then and low and behold by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked I played that game for what seemed like hours on in it was really only a very long weekend But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII my two favorit games in the world I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did It was well worth the price and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner 
Exellent Game This is a no spoiler review This game takes place on a group of islands twenty years after the events of Chrono Trigger This game also takes place between two parallal worlds hence the name Chrono CROSS In this game you have the ability to recruit up to 44 characters To get all of them you will need to play through the game at least 3 times You will probably WANT to play the game more times anyway depending on how long it takes you understand the story line considering it is VERY complex I wouldn t recommend this game to someone who doesn t like RPG s or long games It took me at least 50+ hours to get through the game the first time and that was with the guide book If you plan on getting this game I would also suggest the guide book for it as well Because there are somethings you would not find for the life of you unless you had something telling where to go and what to do For example some of the characters 7th level tech skills are impossible to find and get without the book You can find the Chrono Cross Guide on Amazon as well but beware it usually isn t cheap If you liked any of the Final Fantasy games you would probably like this game as well Something else to keep in mind is that the battle system is somewhat different that any other game you don t use MP you use what are called elements These take the place of magical attacks There is a down side to the elements though when you wish to change characters you must remove all the elements you had on that character so you can place them on another character This can be VERY TIME CONSUMING especially later in the game when you have lots of element slots to fill Beware you WILL HAVE to do this a lot But don t let that get you down This is an exellant game despite all that With all that being said I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan Hope this review helps 
A great game but Misunderstood While it shares the Name Chrono many people think it is a horrible sequel It in fact is not a direct sequel like so many people think it is It is a very well rounded and amazing game to play It follows up twenty years after the Fall of lavos Keep in mind when playing this game that it is a Chronological sequel rather than a direct sequel that so many people fail to realize While the game has numerous playable characters it still maintains a very good story if you follow it closely but at times can become very confusing if you miss certain details Chrono Cross will net you around 30 40 hours of gameplay and if you don t stop playing the game for extended amounts of time the story just becomes completly amazing 
one of the best games ive ever played for any system I ve had this game since the day it came out and some of the cutscenes my opinion are better than a lot of games out today This games unique gameplay i think adds to its satisfactory I love everything about this game for example music this games music is unreal compared to practically every other ps1 game out there IF you take the time to listen to it and your not one of those gamers like i used to be before i actually listened to any games music than u will not be disappointed gameplay I absolutely love this games gameplay because of its unique style Even though u cant really tell how much you have leveled up you can still get the idea from when it gives u a new star so you can learn new moves and more slots for more space new put more skills Charater and attack system there are 40 characters in this game which I think all promote to there own indivituality from the others Some of them may have the same same type and sometimes the same basic idea of a move But each character is uniqely different looking than the others a lot of them use different weapons and armor But the one I like most of all is the way that your special moves for each character get cooler looking and much stronger as you gain stars or levels Some people say that getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes to make this games battle system to easy I dont think that at all because types of people had advantages over others so u have to know that But even if you do the enemies can heal more than you and some enemies you have to run from because their so hard So i dont think its that simple Challenge level I think overall this game is very challenging because of the battle system and because there is a countless of puzzles to figure out in the game that definetly add to the games difficulty I also think the games length adds to its challenge meter because there are so many different paths you can take in the game to change the story line so you can get different characters So if you dont get some the first time you play you can start another game with the same data and everything as the game before So I think that this game is a game that you can t beat so easily in one day I would recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style and amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one of the best games ever created to date 
Truly amazing role playing game Chrono Cross which is a semi sequel to 1995 s Chrono Trigger cant even come close to its former games plateua Chrono Trigger is arguably the greatest RPG ever created So while Chrono Cross is not as good it still does a whole heck of a lot of things right The gameplay story and battles in this game are all top notch Its fun to get a handle over the numerous tough boss battles in this game because of the elemental magics strategic system Black beats white and red beats blue etc Its always fun and interesting to see what the next dungeon or boss has to offer The gameplay is never sluggish and will always keep you on your toes Also when you beat the game you have an option to replay the entire game again with all of your beefed up characters from before And if things are going slow you can speed them up with a fast forward button on your second play through the game Truly brilliant So why does this game get 4 out of 5 if it is so darn good Because of its confusing tedious magic system and over abundance of characters Most of the magics and summons in this game are a joy to watch and to behold their might But in this game there are no magic points and you must equip every single magic spell you have That could mean 50+ spells to equip per character Setting up each character late in the game can take upwards of 5 10 minutes easily And each spell can only be cast once per battle unless you buy multiples of that spell And probably the games worst point is its ridiculous amount of characters Chrono Trigger had something like 7 recruitable characters that you can play as each with their own terrific and unforgettable personalities Chrono Cross has 44 recruitable characters 95 of your 40+ characters have the personality of a wood stool Some characters will literally say Can i join your party than join and NEVER say anything else EVER again Having 44 playable characters instead of 7 spreads each one way too thin and makes them all lose individuality In the end this game is still one of the greatest rpgs ever made for the first Playstation While its few flaws keep it from being a true classic it is still one of the greatest rpg experiences to be had in the past 5 years 
YOU GOTTA LOVE SHREK 2 IT S A MUST This game is really great I would recommend this game to anyone It s a great game to play with the family or by yourself I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times The first time i ve finished it it was kinda challenging on the last level but when I went over it again I zipped right threw it This game doesn t get you bored at all you ll be into it right from the beginning of the game I like how you can choose whoever you want during the game The graphics well they aren t as great as the movie But overall it s awesome I will play it over and over again It s great 
Enternaining This game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious You will need a lot of patience to play it 
Movie Great Game Horrible I know how you feel about the Incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie Dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys Violet is just running around invisible Elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys Plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile Wasn t the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no I in team Well you are all by you re self in this playing one charcter per level Please note all movies made into games are ba 
The Force is Strong With This One After the release of Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith in theaters we got Lego Star Wars a game that was a lot of fun to play simply because it emulated the movies rather well with all the characters being made entirely from Legos Lego Star Wars II The Original Trilogy is even better for the simple fact of nostalgia Any Star Wars fan will enjoy this You ll begin the game in the Cantina in Mos Eisley This is the hub and from there you can go into any of the three episodes and play through them At the start you ll only be able to choose A New Hope but after completing the first chapter you can choose The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi As you go through the three episodes you ll some of the most memorable moments of the movies acted out entirely with legos These moments aren t only memorable but they re given a hilarious charm These moments are also from the actual original versions of the movies as well In other words Han Solo DOES shoot first The game is visually striking Seeing your favorite characters from the original Star Wars films as legos is quite a treat Not only do you get to have nostalgia with Star Wars but with legos as well Even better are the hilarious antics of most of the scenes To benefit the nostalgia even more is how John Williams classic score accompanies each and every level of the game For a Star Wars fan this game is the ultimate nostalgia As you play through each of the classic episodes you ll be in control of several characters Not all at once but you ll end up having to switch At times you may only have two characters at others there may be as many as seven in your party at once Your characters depending on who they are also have their own unique skills they can use Jedi for example can double jump and use the force Those who wield blasters have a grappling hook that allows them to ascend to accessible platforms The droids can open up special doors for you Other characters like the Jawas and Ewoks will be able to go into vents and access areas the other characters can t In all actuality they re really no different than their counterparts in the original Lego Star Wars Also like the original Lego Star Wars you ll constantly have to switch between characters in order to get through each and every area You ll have to switch to R2 D2 to open up a door for example More than one person can play at a time which is also really cool You can also beat up your allies if you wish and they respawn instantly The gameplay isn t completely the same though there have been some small tweaks made here and there The additions to the gameplay aren t huge but they are welcome As you progress through levels all your characters may be able to assemble certain materials together to form a droid to help them fight In the original Lego Star Wars this ability was only given to the Jedi but here everyone can do it There are also moments when you ll have to dress up as a stormtrooper in order to gain access through certain doors You ll also be given the chance at some point to dress up as a bounty hunter and you ll be able to use Thermal Detonators Characters also have their own unique abilities Chewie for example can rip a stormtroopers arms right out of his sockets All of these are welcome additions and that s not even all there is to the gameplay From time to time you ll be in command of vehicles Landspeeders the Millennium Falcon the X Wing and more as you take on some of the more memorable moments from the film like destroying the death star It will probably only take you five hours at the very least to complete the story mode of all three episodes However Lego Star Wars II is full of extras Each time you dispatch an enemy whether it be in story mode or not you ll earn money You can also destroy certain objects and obtain money You can use the money you gain to purchase cheats and hidden characters Each time you get a new character they ll walk around in the hub and you can switch to them Purchasing characters isn t the only way to get them You could easily just use one in story mode and you ve got him or her You ll also get hidden characters if you ve got save data from the original Lego Star Wars Just unlocking all the characters takes a lot of time The importance of unlocking characters is so you can play through certain aspects of the free play mode There are places that in story mode the default characters couldn t reach These hidden characters might be able to reach it though and so you will find yourself playing through levels again The good news is these levels are so much fun that playing through a second third or even fourth time is no hassle at all Free mode also offers a way for you to customize what a character looks like You could put Yoda s head on Luke Skywalker s body for example This is mostly just a lot of fun to mess around with Some combinations are just all out crazy You could for example put Chewbacca s head on Leia s body from when she s wearing the slave outfit in Return of the Jedi This really doesn t do a whole lot for the gameplay as a whole but it is quite fun to mess around with and the combinations are endless The only real problem with this game that I can really think of is that there is little if any challenge at all Each time you die you respawn right where you left off and you have infinite lives There s really no such thing as a game over If you die the only penalty is that you lose money However the sheer fun factor of the game is enough to do away with that and still makes Lego Star Wars II a treat Lego Star Wars II surpasses the original in just about everyway It s a Star Wars game for the classic trilogy done with instant perfection If you love the original Star Wars movies you ll definitely want this game On the positive side +Based off the original theatrical versions and not the special editions +Beautiful game +Addictive gameplay +Co op mode +Several extras and hidden characters +Customizable characters +Tons of replay value On the negative side The story mode is quite short While not really much of a con for this game it s got very little challeng 
How to get it to work I really enjoy this game My friends and I link up on the lan and do some multi player co op battles and have a blast Few bugs that are little annoying but workable If you buy this game soon as you install you wil lget a 1217 error cd key is bad yada yada goto aspy media support spellforce top clicky 1217 error cd key invalid error on the page click download the patch overwrite the bad exe with a less buggy one and play note this patch is about 13 megs and on a dial up gonna take you sometime Gl hope this helps for 20 bucks this game should keep you highly entertained for days If you like age empires and games of that sort this is for you 
Girlie is Great This is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer I love mine 
Nintendo DS Not just fun for kids I purchased a Nintendo DS in the pink color a couple of weeks ago Because I travel several times a year I needed something that could entertain me during long plane trips About a year ago I purchased a Gameboy Advance but I didn t like the graphics The screen was too small and it was difficult to see what was going on Needless to say I sold it a few weeks after I was still interested in buying a portable game system however and didn t know whether to purchase a DS or a PSP The PSP cost quite a bit more but it also allows you to play movies on it I ended up going with the DS because the store where I bought it only had demos for the DS not the PSP The Nintendo DS has good graphics at least far better than the GBA One thing you must look at when deciding which portable game system is best for you is the selection of games The majority of Nintendo DS games are for kids However there are several games that adults can play that will tickle your brain I tend to go for the puzzle games but a few of the kid games are fun as well What I also like about the DS is that you don t have to press down too hard on the screen using the stylus You can purchase screen protectors for your DS but unless you re pressing down much harder than you should you won t need these Also you can store the stylus on the bottom of your system The box contains extra stylii in case you lose one but the handy storage compartment should prevent this from happening You don t have to charge the system too often Usually one charge lasts several hours However whenever I m playing at home I always plug in the adapter Also there s a headphone jack in case you don t want to annoy other people with the audio from the game you re playing Headphones don t come with the system so you have to buy them seperately I bought the DS Starter pack which comes with special DS headphones As far as portable game systems go I suggest purchasing the DS They re perfect for any age preschool age to adult and the price isn t too up there 
Prettier In Pink Nintendo hasmaintained their status as one of the most successful video game companies ever Since they hit it big back in the 80 s they ve maintained to be as synonomous with the way we play video games just as Microsoft has IBM has maintained the computers A couple of years ago Nintendo revolutionary changed the way we play video games with the DS handheld system Not only has it worked very well but it has changed the way we played video games with the touch of a pen Earlier this year the company redesigned the system with the DS Lite Now it has been remade and it is pretty in pink The Nintendo DS Lite in Coral Pink is a video game system not only designed for the hard core gamer but the color makes it have a femanine touch for female gamers too from its detailed color to its elequent pink colored stylus The screen is very crisp and clear and deliver beautifully in its display The graphics are crisper and clearer than the original DS system on so many different titles from New Super Mario Brothers the action packed puzzler Meteos and new games like Star Fox Command and Mario Hoops 3 on 3 Not only that but if you re a fan of Game Boy Advance games you can play your GBA games on the system as well The gameplay is crisper and delivers the best control for the system but also a easier way to play games that original DS owners had trouble tackling All in all the Nintendo DS Lite is a great video game system because it is inexpensive and convient for the die hard gamer in not just the price but the games too I love this system a whole lot and if you have the desire to own a video game system I definitely recommend this one for everyone Graphics A Sound A Control A Fun Enjoyment A Price A Overall A 1 2 
Good Game Disappointing Climax Okay I ll have to start by saying that I don t play many Role Playing computer games I m a fan of the genre but I tend to play strategy command and conquer style games So when I picked this one up I didn t have a lot to compare my experience to I was immediately sucked into the game and the controls WERE NOT hard to learn despite what another review said Character progression is cool giving a fair bit of control over how you develop both skillwise and alignmentwise do you want to be good or evil It s your choice and effects how the game plays out The optional quests and main story quests are all cool but I have to warn you all the final battle is WAY TOO EASY I beat the whole game without maxing most of skills without having most of the really cool legendary weapons and without doing a lot of side quests But you can continue in the game world after it ends just let the credits roll for aprox 10 minutes Though there are no new quests you can run around and tie up loose ends like opening Demon Doors and Silver Key Chests 
I want more This is a fun game I rarely play games last two I really played was Dungeon keeper and Final Fantasy 7 Very enjoyable really not at all difficult if you have a pulse and the story was really cool My gripes are it was too easy evil mode is rather boring you age and everyone else does not too short Too short is the major gripe The only difficult part is the prison sequence which was also the best drama of the story in my opinion I actually got angry and then saddend by the events They need to make a sequal which is much longer actually has a point in evil mode and gives some simbalance of in game time with character age Buy it anywa 
Feed me Seymour I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single player campaign I never played the multiplayer game until I bought Halo 2 Let s get this out of the way first Halo 2 s multiplayer is unparalleled With a multitude of multiplayer games Capture the Flag Juggernaut Team vs Team etc and a dizzying variety of terrains there s plenty to keep Halo fans busy blowing each other up The addition of the alien Elites as a playable character spice things up You can also wield two weapons at a time one in each fist providing another combat option for those gunslingers that like their battles John Woo style Unfortunately Halo 2 s single player campaign is not as impressive To whit the alien Covenant s entire society is based on the idea that activating the giant rings throughout the universe known as Halos will put them on their journey of spiritual evolution The reality is that Halo is a weapon designed to destroy the Flood an infestation of aliens who turn human and alien alike into vicious zombies And how do you keep the Flood from infecting every living thing Why by utterly destroying every living thing in the universe of course Play alternates between Master Chief and the alien elite known as the Arbiter This gives the player both sides of the story which is interesting to a point Eventually the plot converges enough so that the two characters should really end up fighting each other That would have been something if the AI made you play through both battles from opposite sides by creating an enemy that uses your own moves But instead about midway through the battle for the universe a giant plant that looks like Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors shows up This planet speaking in Jabba esque guttural tones rams the plot down our throats by grabbing the Arbiter and Master Chief and shoving them into opposite plot lines the Arbiter ends up working with the humans Master Chief ends up doing the alien dirty work Then things really get going and just as Halo 2 hurtles towards the final battle on Earth the game ends I should have guessed something was up when during E3 interviews about Halo 3 the CEO of Bungee only had this to say Are you ready to finish the war What he meant was Are you ready to finish the game you thought you were finishing in Halo 2 As you ve probably noticed from my review of the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean I really really REALLY hate movies and games that fail to provide a whole story It doesn t matter that this is part two of a three part series Writers and developers have an obligation to provide a full story you CAN create a story with a beginning and end even though it s the middle of a series as evidenced by The Two Towers Halo 2 is an improvement on the original but it loses points for a weak campaign that forces you to play both sides then throws in a talking plant to clean up the mess 
Unabashedly biased about this game First off as many people have said the game is wonderful as a movie less so as a game itself I am not a habitual player of RPGs for the sake of their gameplay however I stray toward puzzle solving and instant action games along the lines of the Ecco the Dolphin and Metroid series respectively but I appreciate the intricate storytelling the genre allows for Xenosaga really goes overboard for the sake of its story and there s nothing wrong with that The game is pretentious and open about being pretentious The cast of characters are all to a greater or lesser degree mentally ill from heroes to villains and back again The story takes a sudden and whiplash inducing turn in the last third of the game The morality of decisions made are distinctly Nietzschean which is to say often amoral and confused But the critical but it s a wonderful story often BECAUSE of these facts If you d like a good story to chew over and talk with your friends about I m still talking about it three years after I was introduced to it buy this game If you want instant action and a transparent storyline eh give it a try It can t hurt anything But understand when you re going into it that this is more of a movie than it is a game the objective is to entertain enlighten and even disturb through the visual medium not necessarily through the gameplay itself Oh and there s plenty of eyecandy for both the ladies and the gentlemen Always a bonus 8 
A very good RPG Unfortunately Xenosaga I Der Wille zur Macht is never come to Europe But as the second Xenosaga Jenseits von Gut und B se was released in Germany in November I was very happy So I played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay I became a big Xenosaga Fan After that I imported the first part of the series from America Now I am playing it and I must say that the first Xenosaga is much better than the second It s a great pity that Xenosaga Episode I never will be brought out in Germany and Europa You Americans should be very happy that so many RPGs come to your country ^_ 
Haven t seen it all yet I m enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when I received it I haven t had the chance to play as much as I d like but I will 
awesome game Don t listen to the other reviewers This game is great By far beats out Sim city 4 and I have that game It s challenging to make everybody happy but if the game was easy it wouldn t be fun 
very fun I have owned the first DS since the day it came out I bought the DS Lite about a week after it came out and I was amazed of the changes It is so much lighter and is just a lot better to have than the original The screen emits about as much light as the sun It is like DLP technology compared to a regular TV Plus most of the games look loads better Sme people say there is a stress crack but I have had mine since June and it is still in very good condition My advice is to you to buy this DS Lite and you will have made a good choice 
Superior Handheld Nintendo has dominated the handheld industry since the GameBoy came out Now that Sony has stepped in some predicted that their hold might finally be breaking Not so and there is no better proof than the DS Lite The Lite is an evolutionary step over the original DS similar to the GameBoy Advance SP It has a more compact form factor brighter screens a side mounted power button weighs less has longer battery life and simply looks more fashionable The basic functionality of the DS is still here same buttons and general button layout wi fi GBA compatibility etc Is this worth buying if you already have a DS Maybe if you ve got some spare cash Is this worth buying if you don t own a DS Definitely The design is far superior to the old DS No DS review would be complete without further mention of the PSP While the PSP is undoubtedly a more capable device it has significant weaknesses compared to the DS Particularly PSP games tend to have far longer load times it has much shorter battery life and the hardware itself is more fragile Oh and of course there s the cost The most critical factor however is the library of games available As of now DS games are more and better and there s simply no contest when it comes to which has more to offer in this department Games are what really make or break a console and the wide variety of excellent casual and immersive DS titles make it a clearcut winner 
Best and Cheapest Cheat Device for PS2 This is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the PS2 For all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research I can figure out a way to solve the problem and I m only 13 You are all over 21 AR Max Memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away Yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that s the price for cheating Who ever said that cheating would be fair Overall besides the Max Memory portion this item is great 
Final Fantasy Chronicles This is one of the best games I have ever played Anyone who is sceptical just needs to pick a controller and go You won t be dissappointed 
Two epic RPG s in one package Two RPG masterpieces Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger have been re released in this great package with some nice additions I ll be reviewing the two games FINAL FANTASY IV INTRO In 1991 FFIV was originally released in America for the SNES under the name Final Fantasy II But the SNES version was pretty flawed For one thing they censored the script and and it was horribly translated Another thing is that they took out a few things such as the Developer s Room Also they toned down the difficulty Now the game has been re released for the PS1 with the complete uncut script Developer s Room and a harder difficulty GAMEPLAY This was the first FF game to have more than the number of characters in your party you can have up to five characters in your party Sweet The game has lots of secrets spells weapons and summons It s a really addicting RPG with a great challenge GRAPHICS Meh It was made in 1991 so of course the graphics look outdated But they were good for the time SOUND Not much to say about the sound It s your standard SNES sound MUSIC I love the music in this game Even 14 years later the music still packs a punch I especially love the boss music It s very catchy STORY This game has a great story I won t spoil it for you but the story is very original filled with plot twists ADDED EXTRAS Besides having the complete uncut game not much Just an FMV scene CHRONO TRIGGER INTRO Ten years ago CT was released for the SNES Even now it s still one of the most loved and popular RPG s ever Now it s been re released with a ton of extras GAMEPLAY CT is an RPG However there are things that are special about this game For one thing the battle system is unique You can use moves that combine different characters It s a bit hard to explain Another thing that makes this game unique is the fact that you can time travel You can alter the past and have fun Plus more eras mean more sidequests GRAPHICS Very ahead of its time CT s graphics were beautiful from the colorful 2D textures to the forests the graphics were topnotch MUSIC Like most RPG s CT has an epic musical score SOUND Pretty good for 1995 STORY The story I believe is solid It isn t the best RPG story ever but it is easy to understand and very entertaining REPLAY VALUE Most RPG s don t really have a replay value but this does Once you beat the game you can do a New Game+ which allows you to start the game over with everything you had on the first game Plus there are many and I mean MANY endings to unlock ADDED EXTRAS Awesome anime cutscenes and much more OVERALL Two epic RPG s in one package A must have 
One of my all time favorite games This is a really nice remake of a great classic FFIV They improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items The challenge level however was bumped up significantly The game was originally paced so you didn t have to spend nearly as much time leveling up A few of the bosses surprised me this time through I ve played the SNES version multiple times in my day The story is unchanged however A must have for any FF Classic RPG fan As a bonus I finally got to play Chrono Trigger 
Good title for cRPG fans This is a good collection It s even better if you have a PS1 emulator and a fast PC This would cut down on the lag Of course if you have such other options arise Some have mentioned the lag issue As one who played through these on the SNES I can assure you there is horrid lag The PS2 has a faster CD drive and some form of caching for PS1 titles which helps dramatically but by no means removes the delay In Chrono Trigger on the console fights started with no discernable lag The creatures on the background jump out at you and you re fighting with no visible delay beyond the jumping animation or whatever they do In FF2 4 the screen did fade black and then faded in but this took about an eighth to quarter of a second estimated Chrono Trigger was a great game The story is fun and the characters are great The story is non linear and you get a great feeling of control How many games give you the choice of killing off one of the bosses or accepting their help Your choice affects the ending in a reasonable fashion FF2 4 was also a great story When I played through it first I commented how it felt like playing through a book Much less choice in progression than even in earlier FF s though Fun regardless Finally he sound quality was lower on the PS version than on the original console The fade effects on the music and such are gone I haven t played through sufficiently to notice any other changes but that one was rather glaring I really liked the use of fadeing to make it sound like you were getting away from the source Such as the Millineal Fair music fading as one wanders away from town The PS version rather ungraciously terminates at some distance and then at some further distance fires up the new music Jarring The original Chrono Trigger would get 5 5 but these issues particularly hinder it 
Great collection This disc set contains two spectacular games Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger Both of the games are wonderful I have played every version of Final Fantasy IV the Japanese version fan translated the English version on the SNES and the remade version on the PSX I loved all three versions Final Fantasy IV s storyline is great The plot starts right away The storylien is gripping and it makes you feel a lot of symphathy for the characters All of the characters have well developed personalities and this game has a quest for redemotion It shows that people can change When Cecil is in a situation where he must choose honor and dignity versus the life he knew he makes a decision that will change his life forever He goes against everything he learned to do the right thing what his conscience tells him and embarks on a quest for redemption When he becomes a new person the other characters are developed and his relationship with his lover and his companions are delved into The storyline is great a wonderful love story and a great tale 
40+ Hours and never boring This game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations There are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light Either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force Crush on your opponent you are very lucky Give this game a whirl 
Excellent strategy game There aren t many games now a days that can get me interested enough to play regularly but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does It s a multiplayer multi platform Mac Windows Linux turn based strategy game There is a tun of different strategies to go with many nations magic items spells different units Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person The only drawback is the interface It s certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff I d highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn based strategy It s the best I ve ever played and I ve played quite a few 
A turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there Its not perferct but its darn good The story if you can really call it that is that the world of Dominions once had one god One day he just wasn t there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job All of these pretender gods have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god To start up a new game of Dominions II you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars You can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary like the arch mage to the outrageously exotic like the fountain of blood Every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease You also pick a castle and set up your own dominion which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world But that isn t all you still haven t actually started a game yet Next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces And lets not forget you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or AI players The game itself is huge and has very few limits Your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to Plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions Like the pretender gods units come in a huge array from simple like the light infantry to the wild like werewoles and vampires Combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research hundreds of magic items to forge and find and random events almost every turn no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability Combat is a bit unsual All units in order to move around the map or attack have to be assigned to a commander Commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men However you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field The downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn Combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle Its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them For better or worse this system is certainly original But some things about the game really bother me My biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer AI Its not thats its too stupid or too smart Its actually a bit like the terminator it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you It can t be reasoned with it can t be bargined with and it won t stop until one of you is dead With no diplomacy options and units like spys assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the AI just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn Another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that isn t easily available in the game Its the same problem Evil Genius had the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens I hope you can read fast The grapics obviously aren t exactly on par with Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but they work however I ve got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright AWFUL You better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over Over all Dominions II is by far the best turn based fantasy game I ve ever played Room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time 
Try for yourself Dominions 2 is a fantastic leap into TBS on an Epic scale Huge Gods battling for supremacy by any means possible Genocide reckless magic and disregard for humanity to be the last god of the panthenon A steep learning curve especially for perfectionists it provides you with a simulation of fantasty combat as opposed to actual historical combat Low end graphics are balanced with the fact there are so many of them along with additional abilities A must for those who love 4X and TBS games Not for everyone and documentation that does not do the game justice it is hard to get into but if you can get past the quot I m LOSING and I don t know why quot feeling you will be well worth it 
this is a STRATEGY game I emphasize strategy What you will not find are fancy graphics studio sound arcade action cheats or a killer strategy that will win every time This game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations another in the works 1100 units 400 spells 400 magic sites 250 magic items and much more But the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in YOUR style Berserker defensive researcher swarmer sneak diplomatic whatever Instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn you can actually develop your OWN tactics and surprises There are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try and yes its one of those games which will ACTUALLY survive on your machine for a year 
Best in Genre I believe this is the best game in the genre It s gotten more play out of me than Master of Magic Heroes of Might and Magic Age of Wonders Warlords Disciples Civilization Alpha Centauri Master of Orion Space Empires or Stars Once of the other posters says they have bad support but that s not been my experience I ve found their continued support and patches to be as good or better than any of the afore mentioned titles not bad for a 2 man team There is an amazing amount of variety in factions and would be gods you can play and best of all it is for the most part solidly based upon Mythology far superior to the typically D D derivative fantasy Multiplayer is fantastic It is a complex game however and not to everyone s tastes Definitely check out the demo first Beware though it s addictive stuff Also check out the fan made maps on their website as well some of which are quite pretty If you re stuck getting started try the excellent Walkthrough by Bruce Geryk also linked from their site 
it s good You already knew it was a good game becuase it s Final Fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games This one is probably a little worse than the best Final Fantasy games such as III and VII but despite that what you have here is a Game Boy Advance RPG that has graphics that actually aren t that bad and the storyline is pretty good too You just can t go wrong with Final Fantasy games 
Not the Best in the Series but Still Good The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package Now the game is where it belongs On a handheld system The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series but it is for the most part an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim Final Fantasy V begins with a character named Bartz witnessing a meteorite come hurdling to the ground When he goes to investigate he meets up with Lenna Lenna is searching for her father who has gone off to the wind shrine to check on the wind crystal Lately the wind has been weak and it can only be because something is wrong with the wind crystal In addition to meeting Lenna Bartz also meets Galuf a man who has lost his memory in light of the meteorite crashing All he can remember is his name and that he too must also go to the wind shrine Eventually Bartz decides to travel with them and so your adventure begins In truth Final Fantasy V doesn t have a good storyline at least when compared to Final Fantasy IV and all the Final Fantasy games that appeared after the fifth installment It s pretty basic and generic This is obvious by how fast you ll meet your main party and how much more emphasis is put on gameplay These characters are not well developed nor is the story full of unbelievable plot twists Except Final Fantasy V was not meant to be about storyline It s all about the gameplay and that s where Final Fantasy V excels the most As with Final Fantasy IV before it Final Fantasy V uses the ATB battle system All your characters stand on one side of the screen while all the enemies stand on the other When a character s ATB gauge fills up you ll be able to issue commands The game then plays out in turn based fashion Final Fantasy V is simple yet it s a lot of fun and it also provides a challenge The gameplay is enhanced even more by the games complex job system The job system is extremely complex even by todays standards As you progress through the game you ll obtain job classes for your characters There are plenty of jobs Monks thieves white mages black mages and plenty more Each of them learn several different abilities all of which can and will be useful to you on your journey When you select a job with a certain character you ll have to battle to earn ability points so that they can learn all the abilities they can Some abilities are more useful than others and the possibilities are endless Also once a character learns an ability you can change jobs and have them equip it So a black mage could in fact use white magic provided he s learned the ability to do it You ll spend a lot of time on the field battling to get ability points The more abilities you learn the more ability points you ll need for the next This is fine and all but most enemies don t give up loads of ability points So the game puts a huge emphasis on battling This is also seen by the low amounts of experience enemies also give off Leveling up is a slow process The good news is battling is fun especially with the job system in place Unless everyone s jobs are the same there s a nearly endless possibility of commands you can give in the middle of battle Final Fantasy V Advance sports the same extras as all the previous Final Fantasy re releases on the GBA do An extra dungeons and some extra bosses and that s about it Nothing too big but worth the price nonetheless It ll probably take you 20 30 hours to complete Final Fantasy V It s not filled to the brim with secrets like future Final Fantasy titles but mastering all the jobs will really keep you busy for several hours alone It s also cool because along with the extra dungeons and bosses you ll get four new job classes This only adds more to the already complex gameplay Graphically Final Fantasy V is a little dated even by GBA standards It looks far better than it did in Final Fantasy Anthology It s much smoother and does have a little bit of an update but it doesn t go the extra mile it could ve Enemies still only flash to attack your characters and they re hardly animated At least the game has a great soundtrack Final Fantasy V goes on to show why the Super Nintendo era for Final Fantasy music was one of the best in the series The game just sounds really good Final Fantasy V is a golden treat for Final Fantasy fans It may have a weak storyline but what it lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay It s not the best in the series but it s still a really fun game The Good +It s a lot of fun to play +The job system makes for a lot of variety in your party +Great music +The minor graphic updates are welcome +Bonus dungeons and bosses +There s a huge emphasis on gameplay The Bad Not enough of a graphical update Weak story and character 
Close to real I m an AFL fan and have been for a while so I got this game since it sounded interesting It s not the truest sim out there it s more like NFL Blitz but indoors Still it s a very fun game if you remember the 2000 AFL season I would have liked to seen more of these games for each season At least this game will satisfy my appetite for AFL football I would suggest all AFL fans to get this game simply for the joy it will bring to you and the fact that this is the only repesentation of the best brand of football out there I just wish other smaller leagues like the WNBA would get a contract for games since there are many fans of these lesser known sports that would love to have sim games GO RATTLERS GO PRED 
Arena Football should be leashed I am a fan of Arena Football I enjoy watching it because it is exciting but this game doesn t live up to the real game The game is very similiar to NFL Blitz except NFL Blitz is better What makes Unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass The most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up If you are thinking of buying this game rent it first to see if it is really worth the money

One awesome football game I ll admit I was a little skeptical about this game As it turns out this game rocks Arena Football fans do not pass this one up Hopefully when they make the sequel yeah I said SEQUEL they will include the new AFL2 teams Tennessee Valley Vipers rule 
WiiPoints Gateway to the Past This WiiPoints card which is the equivalent of 20 allows one to purchase and download games from the Wii s virtual console part of the Wii Shop channel Already at launch 12 games throughout the history of gaming were available including Pinball Nintendo Entertainment System Sonic the Hedgehog Sega Genesis SimCity Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Mario 64 Nintendo 64 Nintendo is planning to add new games every Monday to come to a total of 30 by the end of the year Beyond that new classics are coming throughout 2007 such as Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars Super Nintendo and Mario Kart 64 Nintendo 64 Many of these games can be controlled with the included Wii Remote or the backwards compatible GameCube controllers Some require the Wii Classic Controller but a great number use the other two aforementioned control methods 
Best football game I like the football games Especially the good ones This one is no exception In fact it may be the best I ve played I had Madden 2003 and I was pretty addicted to it but 2006 changed that So many improvements have been made like the new QB Vision That s a pretty neat thing to use but it takes a while to get the hang of it You can turn it off and play old style if you want though The franchise mode has been well improved and I think i ve gotten to where I spend more time dealing with the owner things than actually playing football It s pretty cool The only thing about that though is you can no longer turn the salary cap off so you have to contract players within the means of a budget which can teach you a lot about how owners operate The new superstar mode is cool too and you can become an NFL legend I haven t yet played the online mode yet but I hear it is good too 
Great game good diversion If you liked the first KH you will like this one 
a great game Square and Disney coming together to bring us a video game turned out to really be a good move I think Kingdom Hearts II is an improvement over the original Maybe not a big improvement but enough to consider purchasing The graphics are really good and the difficulty is unfortunately sort of easy The game is really big and contains a MONSTER storyline so it s not like the easiness means you can blow through the game on a lazy Saturday afternoon It just means you won t have much trouble moving through the game I guess Axel was a fairly challenging fight Some other fights are sort of difficult as well I m not entirely sure what to think about the idea of having to complete certain tasks in order to progress forward but I guess it s not that big of a deal Worth buying Absolutely 
Surprisingly good game I decided to try this game because it was listed as a similar game that customers purchased with other games that I really like I am a fan of Longest Journey Syberia Gabriel Knight Broken Sword etc etc I wasn t expecting a whole lot when I started Keepsake but I was looking to kill time because I love PC games From the very start I was swept into the story the setting the characters I LOVE it when there is a fun mascot sharing your adventures The voice overs and some graphics really are pretty unrefined but that also makes the game more endearing These factors could be the reasons this game is not listed way up there with some of the other titles I mention I have added it to my list of favorite games and I play games ALOT 
Basically a good game No this game isn t perfect you ll be annoyed by the dialogue luckily you can fast forward through it and the cut scenes unfortunately you CAN T fast forward through those BUT it s filled with tons of things to solve and if you get stuck you can have the game solve it for you This game will keep you busy for a while but fair warning it s CORNY 
BRILLIANT I was quite unsure on whether to buy the film or not as i didn t think it was going to be my type of film But i bought the game anyway although i hadnt yet seen the film Anyway im glad i did It only took me two days to complete but although it isnt long long it is very good from beginning to end basically going round different rooms of the house doing different things which may seem borin actually it is really fun The activites etc are great it is definately a good game if you like the more adventurous games that arent too hard like me too hard games arent really my type Now i so cant wait to see the film which i recently bought 
A fun game for all ages I enjoyed this game quite a bit I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one You play as the three Baudelaire kids The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely as you must first escape Count Olaf s decrepit mansion then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty s herpetology paradise Aunt Josephine s seaside town and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death The environments are attractive and fun to explore and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating For most of the game as you explore environments solve puzzles search for secret rooms and such you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please For many important events such as boss fights you must play as one or the other as they each have different skills and weapons For some sequences those that are basically 2D platformer sections the entire game has some platformer aspects but it s usually loosely employed and 3D you must play as Sunny the baby Baudelaire and this is the only time you can play as her The various puzzles and challenges they almost amount to a series of mini games are varied and mostly non repetitive helping retain your interest Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform but some are appropriately more challenging both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller and take many tries to complete A couple first person shooter sequences the game is mostly in a third person mode are especially challenging particularly the end but that s the final boss fight so that s to be expected Like most games winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern which takes both brains and manual dexterity There are a couple negatives with the game but they are minor Games like this released in response to the success of a film are often rushed through production That becomes evident here in the cut scenes which are not very exciting they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us But I d rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play and that s just what was done here Also although the graphics are wonderful for the most part the visuals are a bit dark overall I found it best to play with the lights off With a bright overhead light on the glare was too much to see important information in the game Finally I would have preferred a different save game scheme as you can only save when the game asks if you want to and the save points seem almost random Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task Sometimes you have to do long sequences and sometimes a number of challenging ones before you can save again The game isn t quite as funny as the film and doesn t have exactly the same magical atmosphere but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world The soundtrack by Jeremy and Julian Soule and inspired by Thomas Newman s great soundtrack for the film is also a major asset I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else 
Great game this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice 
Just pay the extra money The truth is that these memory cards do not have all that much space on them so you will certainly want to buy two I ve made thousands of saves on these cards and only ever had ONE go corrupt so to say these cards work extremely well has to be an understatement Plus they come in a variety of different colors There are many cheaper memory cards made by various manufacturers but almost all of them seem to have issues of some variety some have problems where data magically disappears some has issues with saves failing just avoid that hassle altogether The cost value ratio may seem poor at first but just surf around the web and find 2 for 29 99 you won t regret it in the long run 
needs to be cheaper I can t believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible So you re forced to shop for one online It s REALLY not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game It s really dumb 
A must have for any PS2 owner period Without this memory card there is no fun When you re playing a game for a few hours and get really far you will definitely wanna save it Without the memory card you will have to do everything all over again With the memory card you can save up and continue playing later Really that s all the information you need Pick it up today 
Great memory card highly overpriced This memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced I didn t have to worry about this because mine came with my PS2 It can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game If you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards If you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused The value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng 
ps2 memory cards ok first of all i think these are too expensive if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting ive never had any problems with these so yeah there ya go buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money 
Excellent Game So if it s such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating Well it s a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me They physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so But everything else is great about it Graphics are great not excellent but great Sound is great too Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed Kinda on the easy side in normal level though But I guess nothing is perfect Go ahead and get this one It s worth what it costs 
Easily the best of the trilogy I ve been a fan of the Prince of Persia series since I was a little kid PoP 1 was great Pop 2 was absolutely unreal PoP 3D was ehhh but then two years ago along came a game that changed everything Prince of Persia The Sands of Time the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone s breath away The gameplay was original flawless and beautiful The storyline sucked you in and didn t let you go even after you d beaten it 6 times over It was a flawless game Last year the first sequel Prince of Persia Warrior Within was released While the game contained improvements in the quality of the graphics and the freeform fighting techniques the game was less pleasing to both critics and gamers Ubisoft had turned the humrous witty intelligent prince from Sands into an angry nu metal rocking humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent on ruining everyone s time While the story was equally as engaging as Sands Warrior failed because it simply was not as much fun to play Luckily Ubisoft saved the best for last The Two Thrones is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played In concluding one of the greatet videogame trilogies ever created Ubisoft have developed a near flawless game It is as though they took the strengths from both games removed the weaknesses of the second game and created a thing of pure brilliance The Two Thrones contains all of the witty punning elements from the first game and mixes them with the exciting more violent elements from the second game while removing everying that ruined the prince s demeanor in the second game The original fun saracastic prince is back and largely because Ubisoft has also brought back one of the things that made Sands so great Farrah Farrah is the perfect foil to our hero She adds humor power creativity and definitely a sexiness to the game that Warrior was lacking Farrah s relationship with the prince is by far my favorite relationship I ve ever played in a videogame and Ubisoft deserves big brownie points for bringing her back The gameplay in The Two Thrones is amazing Throughout the game the gamer is occassionally forced to play as the Dark Prince as there are situations where the normal original prince is unable to get through In other games playing as two characters often appeared more of a gimmick than an actual integral part of the story but in The Two Thrones the reasoning behind the Prince s frequent changing from Prince to Dark Prince and back again is very well explained and very important to the overall story that Two Thrones is telling The fight scenes are epicly fun to play This Prince has more moves than he had in the two last games combined and his battle techniques are a joy to use The new speed kill method of killing some opponents adds a certain amount of skill and brutality to many fights that otherwise would have seemed boring and taken far too long to complete I welcomed the addition of the speed kills once I fully learned how to use them The Prince still moves as acrobatically as ever There is still wall running jumping flipping handsprings etc the only real notable movement difference is when the gamer plays as the Dark Prince The Dark Prince s chain weapon thing can be used to grab onto bars that are are away or objects that would otherwise be out of reach and the Prince can then swing over to them It s not that different from anything the Prince has done before but it was definitely fun to do and worked well with the flow of the game All in all I rate this the best of the new Sands PoP trilogy It s an awesome game that should be played by anyone who has ever enjoyed a 3rd person adventure game If you haven t played either one of the first two games be warned the storyline is actually rather complex and you will be missing much of the story if you haven t played the first two games If you have played the first two games this story is a terrific conclusion to the Prince s tale and the way it wraps around back to the beginning of the trilogy floored me when I finished it Buy this game something worth noting after you beat the game you unlock many videos chief among these is the alternate real ending to Warrior Within that was formerly only available if you beat Warrior after collecting all the life upgrades so if you beat Warrior without all the life upgrades and didn t see the real ending beating this game shows it to you in the video collection 
The Prince Returns The third installment since the rebirth of the classic series and presumably the final chapter in the Sands of Time saga The Two Thrones takes the best elements of The Sands of Time game one and Warrior Within its sequel and caps the franchise with style finesse and gameplay as sharp as a scimitar blade You once again assume the mantle of the nameless Prince of Persia Returning home to Babylon at long last to find it in ruins and its people at war with an army of sand monsters the Prince also finds himself in the company of old friends and old enemies Cursed he comes to find his body and soul split in two and periodically his wicked self known as the Dark Prince rises forth to wreak havoc and take control of the Prince s body The storyline is entertaining its characters more developed than in most video games and it strikes a nice balance between darkness and light heartedness something Warrior Within failed to achieve In essence it s what you would get if you took the tone and presentation of games one and two and rolled them together As mentioned before the gameplay is not far from that either While The Sands of Time set the tone with its acrobatic platforming which remains pretty much in tact Warrior Within took that game s weak combat mechanics and fleshed them out into something a little more interesting Happily both elements are retained and improved upon in this new installment What s more Tenchu like stealth kills are now available While they re far from perfectly executed sometimes they seem unresponsive they nonetheless offer a fresh twist and the opportunity to avoid hand to hand combat in many circumstances The Dark Prince is another significant addition Regularly throughout the course of the game the Prince transforms into this alter ego a sand monster version of himself that is able to use a weapon called the Daggertail This weapon functions much like the Belmont whip in a Castelvania game allowing the Dark Prince to attack his enemies and also swing from poles and light fixtures to access new areas the Prince couldn t hope to reach While stronger than the Prince in combat unfortunately for the Dark Prince he must sustain himself with a constant supply of sand power or succumb to death when it s all been used up That makes these portions of the game more intense and on rare occasions a little more frustrating Also new to the series are the chariot trials sequences during which the Prince must escape via horse drawn wagons through hazardous environments at full speed ahead While they provide a nice change of pace when they do actually occur they are relatively few and the trial and error nature of them can lead to irritation There are only a few glaring flaws in Thrones The sound effects and ambient music retain their inconsistent buggy feel Too often the dialogue sputters and repeats like a broken record and the music kind of fades in and departs with little rhyme or reason As well the graphics suffer from some pretty blatant clipping problems The engine has aged pretty gracefully but it has aged at least the character designs and architecture go a long way keep you distracted from the occasional failings of the visuals Prince of Persia The Two Thrones is in many respects a very similar game to the two that have come before it Therefore it s not as novel as the first game to longtime followers but it doesn t feel as long in the tooth as it might have at this stage thanks to the new gameplay additions and an entertaining continuation of the story It s certainly a better game than Warrior Within more welcoming in almost every way This series has a lot of life in it and The Two Thrones is well worth your time and effort 
Durable This mic is very durable and is wired good haven t had any problems and is much better than the headset 
It does the job No problems so far We ve only used the mic and another that is identical about 10 times now but no complaints so far My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2 It would be nice if there was a gain adjustment right on the mic but that may be a limitation of the PS2 or the game so I can t hold that against the mic without knowing more The cord is pretty long I d say 12 or so Whether or not it works on a PC or if a PC USB mic works on a PS2 I don t know Since I don t have any complaints you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 To me 4 stars means It does the job and has no major flaws 5 stars means This thing is awesome 
Get it If you are going to play Karaoke Revolution or any karoake type PlayStation 2 Game then you NEED this mike The headset bundled with the game is neither durable nor practical and as mentioned before it rarely fits everyone And it broke a few weeks after I bought the game This Logitech mic is much better and you can be a true karaoke star without worrying about getting too far for the cord it s 15 feet or knocking the headset off your head with your crazy moves I d say the only downside is that in Volume 4 when you do Sing and Dance you can get entangled in the cord if you re not careful But I just bought one for our KR game and I m about to get another so we can do duets 
Innovative console game now looks dated This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available But today with doom and half life versions for xbox there is actually something to compare halo to and it doesn t stand up First off the plot is utterly pointless I never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief just frustrated when he died that I would have to replay a section The weapons are lame Released after the PC version of quake iii halo s weapons seem limp in comparison None of the futuristic aspects seem particularly believeable or useful for that matter The vehicles suck Driving the vehicles in Halo is as fun as operating a forklift which is actually quite entertaining in GTA san andreas so maybe it is not quite that fun I guess it is more like driving that super action wacky bike from the southpark chimpocoman episode 2 player story mode rules the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend multiplayer deathmatch is average Give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox but it wasn t as good as it s PC competition when it came out The much older quake III still looked and played better and now seems OK but no better than most That said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10 15 diversion just don t expect the immersive atmosphere of doom III or the intriguing plot twists of half life 
Way way better than part 2 Halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time This is definately a good game to play if you ve never played a first person shooter Also if you have an Xbox you should get this because it is awesome Ratings Graphics Then 10 Now 7 Sound 10 Replayability 6 Controls 10 Drawn In Atmosphere 9 Fun 9 Multiplayer Co Op 9 Multiplay 
This game was good For those that have have played similar games like Sim City before this one was great I have played Sim City 2000 but that was years ago I had found that game addicting Now years later when I ordered Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition I was blown away This game is much better than 2000 could hope to be They have resolved many of the issues that I had with the older game and then some I have found this game to be addicting to and have started different cities at the same time I am working on getting the perfect city for me to be happy with I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of any of the Sim games I could even say at times it was funny even to read the tongue in cheek sayings that come up just as you are starting up the game for the day like Bureaucratizing Bureaucracies It was not so much hilarious but it can help you get in the fun mode to play the game The advisors can get slightly annoying after awhile especially when you have a different idea about what you want to see in your city than they do but it is still overall a very entertaining game My next purchase will most likely be Sims 2 for more of the Sims experience 
Great Game This is an excellent game People who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game

I love it I honestly HATE fighting games I think they re boring and they don t offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by Enter Tekken Tekken has been around for many years When it first came out everyone loved it It used to compete with Virtua Fighter on the Sega Saturn I was impressed then and I m impressed now all these years later The action is just a lot of fun You really couldn t ask for a better fighting game The graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments I love the game and I hope you do as well 
Welcome return to form for an old master Ahh the Tekken series Probably the most influential series of 3D fighting games outside of the Virtua Fighter games Tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre With the 4th game just a distance memory this takes the series forward or back depending on how you look at things Tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted Tekken gameplay while still making everything feel fresh Characters that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones are now fully fleshed out with moves of their own Anna Williams for example is now not a clone of her sister Nina When people mention Tekken they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their mad skillz as it were Making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre This I think is far from the truth Tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike Whereas button bashing pretenders to Tekken s crown coughDeadorAlivecough leave you feeling somewhat cold Tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play Yes Tekken 5 has its button bashing characters but every single character IS unique and how unique they look Arguably the best looking PS2 game to date With gorgeous backdrops fluid realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next gen console Music wise it s back to form mix between techno dance we ve come to know and love from Tekken The least we say about Tekken 4 s music the better You ve got your usual Story mode to run through with each character To see why they ve entered the tournament etc But this 5th edition borrows the human AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4 This has replaced the Arcade mode in name and pits you against humans who have uploaded downloaded their data from the Tekken arcade machine from all over the world It s a welcome challenge even though it doesn t even compare to facing a real life human opponent All in all this is the true homecoming of a master Easily the best Tekken to date and probably the best 3D fighter in existence Though I am partial to abit of Soul Calibur heh 
The best Tekken yet With Tekken 5 the folks at Namco have crafted the best edition yet of the long running fighting franchise Featuring a horde of fighters undoubtadly the best lineup yet Tekken 5 features the same deep gameplay and combo mechanics that will keep you playing for quite some time And because it s Tekken there s a bevy of hidden characters and features to unlock as well There s no Tekken Force mode this time around and instead there is Devil Within a segment that is similar to Tekken Force where you play as Jin Kazama as he battles his way to learn of the devil gene within him It s not much to write home about in itself but there s more features to behold here as well including the addition of playing the arcade versions of Tekken 1 2 and 3 as well as the Namco shooter Starblade The graphics are improved and the backgrounds have been revamped as well all helping make Tekken 5 the best fighter not just for the PS2 but for home consoles in general For veterans to the series and newcomers alike Tekken 5 is a masterpiece and essential to every PS2 owner s library 
Ah the good old days Amazing how far computers have come since my old C64 was classified as a powerful machine graphically I love the new stuff but once in awhile its nice to backtrack to the good ol days of 64k memory and 5 1 4 disk drives I agree with the review about the difficulty of the games but its just once again a reminder of the changes in gaming with the times My old C64 eventually burnt up with use and its nice to see I m not the only one to miss these game treasures included on this wonderful piece of equipment Now if only somebody would do this with an apple II 
A Commodore hackers dream The 30 in 1 sold thru Amazon is a real Commodore 64 computer on a single ship The NTSC Version 1 board has 128KB RAM and a 2MB ROM inside the case of the D2TV there are solder pads that will allow anyone who can solder to attach connectors for the IEC serial buss a PS2 keyboard and in some cases a second joystick and some of the wires for the user port product identification Version 1 comes in a pyramid shapped box has 128KB RAM 2MB ROM Version 2 comes in a hexagon shapped box has 2MB RAM 2MB flash Version 3 boards are in a game called Hummer of road racing 
C64 30 Games in one Brings back the good old days of playing these games after school 
Good but too expensive I have this Monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable about 65 for both and can say that it s the best connection you can find for your old XBOX However I can t really recommend them due to their high prices If you can find the Microsoft HD pack get that as it s much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length 10 feet which can go from one side of my entertainment center where the xbox is to the other side where the stereo receiver is 
Totally sweet One feature that hasn t been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you won t hear any extra noise from EMF Also make sure you check your xbox settings once you ve plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under Display Settings for choosing HD capabilites Make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there isn t that much difference 
Good stuff It works great great quality great sound and ESPECIALLY great color detail only thing that sucks is actually getting the cables into the tv plugs it s horrible on most tv s i ve seen with component plugs the plugs are are built very close together and each of the component ends blue green red where the cap kind of goes over actual thing you put in the usually gold plated thing are almost too big so you can t fully plug in all 5 of them 3 video 2 audio but just kinda have to push em in just enough so that it actually works other than that the quality and everything is fantasti 
Xbox Forget about the brick I could care less what it does for the original Xbox what I m into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer Xbox save files over to Xbox 360 Now I won t have to start Halo all over 
Great Games I also am a huge monkey ball fan and also own them all and this one is just as good as not better than the others game play is awsome with the new control system and as for the old target game their are a few target games on this one if you dont like monkey target then try paraglider for a much harder and funner game This games has so many games that are fun with friends of all ages snowboarding a few racing disk golf free throw hovercraft battle boxer bowling fencing sling shot and so many more 
So much fun for the whole family This game is tons of fun My husband children ages 6 and 7 and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game This game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker 
Lots of fun better than owning a karaoke machine This game was a lot of fun The microphone headset works great The only downside is I wish it had more songs but I guess that is what sequals are for Overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself 
Lots of fun especially with a lot of people It s a pretty fun game It doesn t have a whole lot of songs maybe around 30 40 but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know or would be willing to learn There are also several different modes to play in so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it Perhaps one of the best features is that up to 8 people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers all you need is one controller and the USB headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play I agree with everyone else though when they say the headset is very flimsy I originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal Bad idea You practically have to eat the thing to sing and it IS small and will get caught in long hair Plus you don t get the fun karaoke experience My advice buy the game separately then get the handheld mic As soon as I get some more money I m gonna get the handheld mic myself it picks your voice up better Overall a good buy And lots of fun especially if you have a lot of outgoing un self conscious people 
HARD this game is HARD but very fun so if you want to pick between Fantastic Four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you 
Its what to expect of a do what you want game The game when you first buy it is awsome i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters make people fly 20 yards with your finger and bunt kick a police car down 5 blocks the game lasts a bit because of the smash smash get some cash gameplay the more smash points you get the more moves you get the moves are the best part at one point in the game you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street its alot better then skateboarding on a bus if you ask me anyway once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers it gets extremely repetitive at the end of the game when you get critical alert status the same guys always come 5 5 stars for the first 3 weeks 2 months 4 the next month and basically declining to 3 BUT whenever you are board and have nothin to do no good tv is on all of your friends are offline and every other game is getting booring its nice to take a good ol trip back to this game and smash a mech or to you know for old times sake 
Satisfy your inner green guy Parents The content in this game seems absolutally fine for anyone roughly ten and up The only reason I see it as rated teen is because this game requires a good bit of hand eye cordination sometimes Aslo the hulk roaring might get to little kids who are still around the age where they still come up to you in the middle of the night to check there closets for monsters but basicly if your kids can handel action cartoons like Ninja Turtles and Justice League they deffinately can handel this game Anyways I wasn t sure about this game when I picked it up I don t know why I hadn t heard much about it and I hadn t played many comic book based games besides the Spiderman based one on the Playstation But I didn t see many other games at the rental store the kids could play on my XBox so I rented it out to see if it was okay It is in my opinion an absolutaly great game for almost anyone The entire game was like a digital stress ball for me you get to rampage to your hearts desire I spent a few hours alone that week just ignoring the story chapters completely and just wrecking the huge city and desert military bases to game takes place in Kids would also love it for the same reason they build lego houses and then smash them to bits with their action figures The story is a bit odd if you don t know much about the hulk already as it revolves around bruces quest for a cure in order to stop a second more evil and cunning Hulk Bruce Banner Discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named the Devil Hulk The big green savage Hulk we all know and love also doesn t like the Devil Hulk moving in to Banner s mind so it becomes more agreeable to suconicous orders Banner uses to get the child like brute to do what he wants Meanwhile a new baddie called the Abomination appears after one of the military general stupidly trys to recover one of bruce s failed cure attempts in the very begining of the game All in all the story is okay as you go on but you can tell they tried to stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into a game story only as an excuse to callenge you with bosses and other unique situations As far a gameplay goes it s fantasic The more damage you cause the more smash points you earn and the more moves you can buy later too continue your assult on just about everything There are mini games and secrets everywhere to earn even more smash points with In fact the only thing that s missing is a co op or two player mode As far as replayability goes it s always there Anyway I would recommended this game to a anyone who has kids roughly around ten b anyone who likes third person single player games and c anyone one who has been stress out at work one too many times or feels like throwing a temper tantrum 
Hulk Smash Plot Lines I love a good intricate storyline in a game as much as the next person The RPG known for it s generally intricate plotline is one of my favorite genres And to The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction s credit it does contain a story penned by a seasoned comicbook author And again to the game s credit the story really isn t too bad fairly generic but servicable The script is voiced adequatly and presented in a way that doesn t deter from the real focus of the game Rampant wanton gratuitous destruction in some of the most creative ways possible I love The Hulk as a character I even liked the Ang Lee flick no hate mail please myfriends give me enough crap for that one as it is There s something cathartic about a nearly indestructable creature that operates on pure Id Who doesn t want to just lose it when we get pushed too far This game has many things going for it it controls very well nearly every object in the vast and varied environments is destructable in some way shape or form and the graphics are certainly servicable although not top notch The best way to describe this is to take an open gamespace like the Grand Theft Auto games minus the infuriatingly difficult missions and add a set of missions that beg you to destroy everything Every mission is based in some way on the premise of you as a giant green demolition expert Now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly but the game does remain fresh do in large part to a huge selection of upgraded moves that you can buy with smashpoints which are awarded via smashing things deep huh It is really a massive orgy of soothing mayhem and mercy is it ever satisfying If you tried out the first Hulk game please be aware that this is NOTHING like that There are no more tedious sneaking missions as Bruce Banner YOU ARE THE HULK and the Jade Giant is an absolute gas in this title Like the GTA games you are not forced into playing missions although this does unlock new moves and arenas to play in You can take on side quests which are not only pretty creative but downright hilarious in others try batter up for an example of the latter If the first Hulk game and Ang Lee s movie left a sour taste in your mouth when it comes to Mr Green Genes then give this one a shot In my opinion they got the essence of the Hulk down pat and show him for the fun character that he can be Later 
The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction Previous Hulk games haven t been quite up to par with other superhero franchises featuring tedious Bruce Banner stealth bits instead of placing the emphasis where it should be smashing stuff and having that stuff smash up real good Fortunately that isn t a problem with the latest installment This game is all about creating as much destruction as possible in any way you see fit be it ripping a car in two to make Hulk sized novelty Hulk hands using a truck as a shield or fashioning a boulder into the world s largest bowling ball Not only that but Hulk has a large variety of moves that give the player a lot of options for combat I can t really comment on the story since I skipped it I ve never been the biggest fan of the Green Machine s mythos and backstory so I suppose your mileage might vary But not that much thanks to flat as cardboard voice acting All in all this game really makes you feel like you re in control of a gargantuan green Goliath The boss fights are especially great when you go against a giant Hulk busting robot that levels entire city blocks with each laser sweep you know you re having fun Unfortunately the game drags with the repetitious combination of escort destroy and fetch story missions I can appreciate that Banner wants to return himself to normal but destroying an entire building just to snatch a CAT scan That s a little lame Plus you ll be right at the end of a mission when a bevy of Hulk seeking missiles and Hulk crushing mechs always seem to show up and gun you down Even poor Greenie can t do much when he s being wailed on from all sides BOTTOM LINE Probably the best superhero game of this console generation Hulk smash 
Finds a middle ground between the mediocrity of the first title and the excellence of the second In a way Jak 3 is more of a direct sequel to chapter two than it is a continuation of the storyline that was established in part one I realize that this was meant to be the end of a journey a coming of age story that follows the title character through his innocence his adolescence and finally his ascent into adulthood Bearing in mind it s only natural that he d want to distance himself from the people and places that make him feel like an adventuring child rather than a self assured saver of globes When I became a man I put away childish things after all Where the inspiration behind the storytelling of Jak II was unquestionably Blade Runner the main source of direction for this final chapter comes largely from Mel Gibson s The Road Warrior The outlanders who rescue the title endorsed duo from their exile and drag them back to their own makeshift shanty town are the textbook definition of an early 80s burly man They adorn themselves with hundreds of pointy edges enormous hopelessly detailed weapons and layer after layer of questionably hemmed leather They puff out their chests at every opportunity and speak like a cluster of throat cancer survivors These new characters are just overflowing with personality which makes the minor cutscenes and motivational speeches entertaining but I couldn t shake the feeling that they were just going through the motions in an attempt to mimic the successful main cast of the second game It s like they were trying to match the edge of the gritty sullen warriors of Jak II but were missing some intangible element that kept them from reaching that full potential The twists and turns of their storylines were somewhat transparent I d figured out the major twist in Damas s story within an hour of meeting him their importance to the central plot is thrown into question fairly early on when you return to the city around the three hour mark and only occasionally return to the desert thereafter and for all of their gusto their emotional impact on the player doesn t hold a candle to the inner city gangs that ran chapter two As the last game in the series Daxter on the PSP and Jak X Combat Racing have since been released continuing the saga and there are rumors of a new game on the PS3 Jak 3 is an atypical grand finale A lot of things didn t happen that I expected to during the wrap up cutscene at the very end and vice versa I was caught off guard by more than a few revelations including the Wizard of Oz styled reveal just before the final boss For the first time I think the series found its stride in the vein of comedy it had sought since day one The character interactions are actually very funny in places I legitimately laughed out loud on more than one occasion which is not something I m known to do during a game With the outline in place and the unexpected twists and turns counteracting the few more obvious revelations Jak 3 s story would have set the stage for one of the greatest final chapters in video gaming history if only it were a bit longer Jak 3 weighs in at about a dozen hours which is less than half the length of Jak II and that results in a much less rewarding experience than you d hope for in a final episode It also wasn t nearly as difficult as its immediate predecessor which means less screaming and shouting but also less relief and self assuredness upon reaching that final scene After completing part two I had a sense of accomplishment almost pride at having finished such an elaborate and difficult game I didn t get that same sensation upon putting this one to bed One area in which Jak 3 doesn t disappoint is the holy crap department It just spoils you with these things you ll control Daxter as he clings for dear life onto a speeding missle a live freaking MISSLE you ll leap onto a teensy platform while the camera leers above you and displays the dizzying heights below you ll take down creatures the size of a whale just unimaginably cool stuff It doesn t overload on the action in quite the way that God of War did but it s pretty close and the last full hour of gameplay is one of those long moments that transcends mere video gaming and puts the player right into the middle of a summer blockbuster I ve long considered the last stage of the original Halo to be one of the if not the greatest level in the history of gaming and I d seriously consider the closing moments of Jak 3 at least on par with that So yeah very high praise indeed In both the grand finale and throughout the entirety of the game there s a lot of variety in the gameplay This is not just your standard jump shoot and explore adventure game You ll bump into an odd blend of flight stages DDR style coordination stages racing levels and railed first person shooter segments in addition to the exploring jumping punching shooting and all around adventuring levels And while this is something I had a big problem with when it was shoved into the mechanics of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it doesn t bother me so much here The main reason is because the Jak series has always had some sort of similar variety ingrained within it but it s also a bit more admissible here because the setup actually works Nothing feels like it s been needlessly crammed into the proceedings like the dance stages or the workout levels of San Andreas it all just works together several parts of a whole While the basic gameplay model and its dedication to consistently bending genres has remained mostly intact there are two notable variations from the functionality of Jak II that become abundantly clear within the first couple of hours First and foremost is the much much heavier emphasis that s placed on the driving stages more so than in The Precursor Legacy and Jak II combined In this third chapter they re vital to the completion of half the game s levels including the final boss fight It s almost to the point that I d call this an action racing title because you ll find yourself spending as much time behind the wheel as you are on foot When it was successful the vehicle based gameplay was a blast something that s never really been tried before a sort of supercharged platformer on wheels On the few stages that failed however the wheels felt like a gimmicky death trap Incredibly frustrating like trying to shove a square peg through a round opening Largely the vehicle stages were a roaring success however Secondly there s the revelation that there is a Light Jak to mirror the beastial Dark Jak that was unveiled in the second game Where Jak s darker persona brought with it a variety of new attacks and offensive maneuvers his light side focuses more on exploratory aids and defensive mechanisms As such it s not quite as exciting to play as Light Jak for the first time as it was to burst into Dark Jak mode near the opening of Jak II It s just not as much fun to grow wings and casually flutter around a room as it is to fire purple lightning out of your fingertips and fry the opposition These light powers enable a few new modes of exploration for the die hard fan but are generally fairly useless and go unused until the situation demands that you employ them F As far as controls are concerned it s a pretty tight ship at this point in the series Most of the infuriating glitches and bugs from the first game were ironed out in the second chapter and the third game actually improves upon the near perfection attained by the second A few jump commands go unrecognized and I had some problems with touchy collision detection during the faster races which meant I had to hit the checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again but those are minor gripes at best Visually this could pass as Jak II s identical twin The characters look almost exactly the same as in the previous chapter and all of the little quirks cartoony exaggerations and background puns that gave the first two games their identity are here in living color It s not the best looking game I ve ever played and I didn t notice much of a difference upon switching to progressive scan but it s near the top of its genre all the same I d imagine the phrase ain t broke don t fix it could be applied to Jak 3 without hesitation The voice acting is one area that s been kept fairly high in quality throughout the series and that legacy is kept up here Where the story falters the voice actors often revive it and vice versa it s a good collaboration The scenes are routinely stolen by Daxter and or the villains who go above and beyond in their pursuit of a good reading that matches the circumstances while Jak is kept fairly low key and stoic It s for the best too because on the few occasions where he does decide to go all macho and tries to spit out a line like let s go kill us some metal heads it doesn t fit and he comes across as awkward and unsure Upon completing the second game I likened it to The Empire Strikes Back in that it took a fairly light hearted series and transformed it into a more adult oriented saga with incredible results For what it s worth that Star Wars parallel carries over fairly accurately with this third chapter you ll get lots of warm fuzzies at the end and it s not quite as weighty or substantial as the second chapter but overall it s still a very entertaining experience with a cast of characters you can t help but love The big action scenes are really done fabulously and there s rarely a dull moment but this game suffers from the unbelievable quality of the game that immediately preceded it 
The end has come is that a good thing Note This review is spoiler free with regards to the game s story All good things must eventually come to an end such as the star wars series the lord of the rings trilogy and the Jak and Daxter trilogy not including the racing game and Daxter s own PSP game After two excellent games our favorite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the Jak trilogy The big question is Is it a good ending I m pleased to say that overall yes Jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of Jak 2 Haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots metal heads and other nasties The population blames Jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help Abandoned by those he saved Jak and his buddy Daxter set out on thier final adventure Like it s two predecessors Jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter You get various jumps kicks punches and leaps and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy Kung Fu and karate aren t enough Jak s moves remain largely unchanged from Jak 2 which will now be called J2 He can still punch like a man jump like a kangaroo and leap like a bullfrog Gunplay remains pretty much the same as well You get four guns blaster rifle machine gun and peacemaker but in a nice twist each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on The rifle for example starts out in it s default setting Hower the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions Each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast The peace maker for example can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around whee while it s final upgrade well let s just say that you ll be shooting mini nukes a lot The biggest change to Jak s game play comes in the form of vehicles While J2 had flying vehicles and zoomers Jak 3 has cars and not the nice talking Pixar kind Because half the game is set in the desert Jak and Daxter get around on dune buggies There are eight of them and each has various unique traits Some are really really fast one can jump riddiculously high wheee and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick boo You ll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part it s enjoyable and fun though some of them such as the sand shark can be a bit difficult to handle Another new feature of Jak 3 is the sheer size of it J1 and J2 had two enormous areas to run around in Here you have not one not two but three yes three gigantic areas to run around in And like the previous games there are no loading times an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds Spargus city the wasteland and Haven city are You ll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout Jak 3 s world such as how Haven city has ahem changed since the last game Dark Jak powers return as well but are now balanced by a new side to our hero light Jak If Dark Jak is the attacking force Light Jak is the defensive force Dark allows you to kill things really quickly while Light allows you to heal fly this is so AWESOME surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield and even slow down time to a crawl Both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters And in a very nice touch you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it While both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during gameplay both are really just a little added bonus to spice up gameplay when you want to as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force except for scripted moments where you need to But then again being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing smile Like J2 Jak 3 has you going from place to place talking to people and doing what they tell you to do And when you finish with that you head over to the next person and do what they want to do etc It s a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive but it does have one big strength You don t have to start the next mission until you want to If you want you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times and then tackle the mission This free roaming system allows you to do what you d like to do if you don t feel like doing missions for a while One thing i d like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level If one takes a look at my review for J2 one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards Naughty dog for making J2 the most unnecessarily hardest game i ve ever played and it still is by the way tied only with Spider man for PS2 I am very pleased that Naughty Dog towned down the difficulty a lot for Jak 3 No longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the TV while screaming obscenities becuase that a hole Errol won that fricken race again Here the difficulty seems just right Not too hard not too easy Most missions require a few attempts before they are completed and a few can be finished on one try There are still a few that are quite difficult and one or two that are grit your teeth inducing but overall nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series Oh and there are only a few go through the ring missions this time around Thank goodness In addition to the free roaming gameplay there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest There are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in Jak 3 and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light Jak power invincibility extra vehicles various weapon upgrades etc While some are hidden behind corners many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way such as searching around a paticular area going through rings grumbles following a little blue light and even stopping time There are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs but the results are well worth it In addition Jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of wow factor Fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine Even with all these fine points Jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game the story J2 is most memorable to me for it s story It had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next The story in Jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next but ultimitly it left me unsatisfied How so The three biggest ones are charachters the precursers and the ending And for those of you worrying that i m going to tell you who the precursers are which I won t i m going to keep this as spoiler free as I can First off the charachters We have Jak and Daxter of course and those two are always fun to watch and care about We have many returning charachters such as Torn Sig and Samos and we have some new residents from Spargus city The problem Almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development It s assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that Jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do That may be okay but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all Torn is still gruff and tough but not as much as last time Ashelin is the firm leader and Samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly Keira who was such a vital charachter in J1 and J2 has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important Sig well he s just there because he s cool The only returning charachter who kept me interested was Tess who fufills the dumb blonde role Her relationship with Daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily Errol returns as well though I won t say how but he s gone from insanely irritating to average irritating a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in J2 Of the new charachters only one Damos kept my interest due to his charachter Tough yet gentle and caring at the same time he s easily the most compelling of Jak s new companions The new villian count Veger isn t that compelling though he does have some very powerful scenes especially one near the ending One of the claims on the back of the game box is that we ll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are As I said earlier I won t reveal who the precursers are someone did that and ruined the suprise for me except that in my personal opinion we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery I personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now It s like revealing the face of doctor claw When you go back and experience your old memories there is no more mystery or wonder anymore In my personal opinion these beings should have remained hidden forever However the saddest part of the game for me is the ending Again I won t ruin it for you but it s always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes Some people criticise the ending of the film Return of the King saying that it goes on too long However the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it s time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied However Jak 3 doesn t do that As the game goes on and gets closer to the end the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes and sadly the battle itself isn t that exciting or memorable The ending does end the trilogy but leaves the door wide open for more games of which two have already happened I ve invested a lot of time on these three games i ve grown attatched to it s charachters and I would like closure to all thier stories Saldy that doesn t happen Everything is left wide open when in my opinion it should have been closed There is no real ending here at least one that ties everything up nicely But despite my points with the story I do want to stress that Jak 3 is a very good game It s a satisfying blend of storytelling platforming shooting driving and action It s one of those games where you keep saying Just five more minutes just five more minutes only to discover that time has flown by and it s two in the morning It s addictive fun and for me a blast to play I definitly recommend it especially if you find it for under twenty dollars 
This game is awsome This is the best jak game in the series The handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur The game is not easy which is good Graphics are good as well If you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game Overall I give this game a perfect 10 
Awesome Game Star Wars Battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever such as the Rebel Alliance Imperials Republic and CIS Confederacy of Independent Systems The 3 D graphics make it easier to enjoy as well for sound and storyline In Battlefront you can not play as featured characters in the saga but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels Another disadvantage is you can t wield a lightsaber either In Instant Action you get to pick any location and any side to fight for You also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war As a matter of fact you can drive vehicles but no space combat If you want to play on Episode III battlefields your hopes are up Only locations from episodes I II IV V and VI There are numbers of areas to battle on But for pros and cons cons are going to have a hard time through the game such as What type of soldier Where is my command post Where is my enemy at For pros there is nothing wrong Star Wars battlefront is one of the best star wars games there is about Star Wars along with the perfect gameplay terrific graphics and great sound I highly recommend the game to any star wars buff s out there 
AWESOME GAME This game has outstanding graphics and great 3 D gameplay plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action To add to the few you can play in the Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War the bad thing though is that in the Clone Wars the main battles are on Naboo to be honest the Clone Wars started on Geonosis and are in Episode II not I I love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons and you can also play as the wookies clones droids rebels and Imperials If you are a beginner video game player or new to Star Wars when you choose CREATE FILE try using easy This game follows the movies really well and you can explore Mos Eisley or maybe Naboo if you like The more battles you win the bonuses you get If you read the Instruction Booklet it says if you go on a Killing Spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus I Highly Recommend this game to all Star Wars fans The game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time So if you want a good long lasting game try this I really hope Star Wars fans will love the game Multi Player mode is great and I really enjoy playing it This game is great and I love it Try playing it for yourself I am about to wrap this review up so listen THAT THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR THE XBOX AND HAS TERRIFIC GAMEPLAY AND FEATURES THAT YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY IT ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLINE OR SINGLE PLAYER YOU CAN STILL HAVE FUN AND KNOW IT IS ALL OUT STAR WARS ACTION THIS GAME IS GREAT AND I JUST LOVE PLAYING IT I know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three I enjoy playing this BUY IT NOW P S BUY EVERY THING STAR WARS 
Great game and concept I ll admit that being able to go around as a stormtrooper and kill everything in sight is fun Wicked fun This game delivers if you want to have a good time playing a FPS involving Star Wars The major drawback to the game is the targetting It s like using a sniper rifle in Halo 1 but the reticle is the size the one for the assault rifle You can turn on the auto aim option to help with accuracy but then the reticle tends to follow an enemy on screen and it s more difficult to shoot over an ally s shoulder Another drawback is that you can t jump fall and shoot at the same time like in other FPSs Plus fighters are hard to learn how to use as are other vehicles You can still do fine as a footsoldier but it would be nice if the vehicles were a little easier to use 
Must have When I upgraded to the 360 I was a bit saddened that I would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing First wireless No tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have Also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also although I m sure they re on the wired controllers quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game Plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch 
Sleek Although I don t own my own Xbox I always play someone else s because I already own a PS2 I never the less feel obligated to add my thoughts on the matter The new Xbox controller S is one sleek piece of equipment FAR superior to that original monstrousity of a controller those idiots at Microsoft initially came up with it was that super ugly gigantic and clunky original controller that turned me off from buying the Xbox when it came out The new controller S is visually appealing to the eyes Although the PS2 controller is still slightly more attractive the controller S is an extremely close second The controller s is smaller and handier than the original has easier to use controls and is VERY comfortable to grip Just compare the different controllers of Xbox PS2 and Gamecube by holding them in your hands and fiddling around with the controls You will see that the Xbox controller S has the nicest fit of them all on the palms of your hands the Gamecube is the least comfortable Ironically the controller S was originally designed for the Xbox release in Japan because the original controller was deemed too big for Japanese players I really think those folks at Microsoft should plan things a little better before jumping in to the game 
HEE HEE Needs more shoulder buttons Other than that is good 
have the light blue it s great As I have said I have the blue DS and it is great I don t have any big fancy words to describe it but it s durable dropped many times works just as good as the day I got it have 5 or so games for it nintendo dogs new super mario mario vs donkey kong march of the minis monopoly Gameboy Advance oh yeah it s GA compatible mario kart and some other crazy game my husband liked anyway buy extra pens if you have children they get lost quickly it s wireless so you can use it against another DS the nintendo dogs game senses other dog owners and you can hook up and play with their dog Easy to use with it being handheld I was weary of the fact you have your hands so close together and a small screen but I have never had a problem with it unless you play the new super mario bros on it then your thumbs begin to cramp because of the addiction to the game Battery life is good as well it can last on a charge for a long while 3 4 days without having to charge if you play it for only a few hours a day Several games and good ones at that read some of my game reviews Overall go out and get one your whole family will love it 
Great Purchase Bought this as a gift for my granson It is awesome Many games to pick from and the ease of use is great He s only five and works the buttons with ease Plus you can take it anywhere Great price here too Cheaper than anyone else 
Geekdom at its best There is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than Dungeons and Dragons and that is Star Wars This game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things It is a flawless game 
One of the most addicting games that I ve ever played I am a huge Star Wars fan but I don t really like RPG s all that much at least not video games I do play DnD That said this game absolutely blew me away As a DnD player I knew that there wouldn t be a learning curve on the game since it uses the D20 system Knowing the system really helped with feat selection and such as there really wasn t anything outlandishly new I was however a little disappointed with the small number of Force powers that were in the game I don t think that I would bother having my main character be a Jedi Consular as you can really get a decent amount of Force powers even with a Jedi Guardian and if you have some Wisdom enhancing items you can use those powers often as well The character creation system is pretty standard I was slightly disappointed that you have to be human as I really wanted to create a lightsaber wielding Wookie but for the purpose of the story it won t take you long to figure out that being human is definitely a good thing on Taris And the fact that a Wookie eventually joined my party later adequetely mollified me In fact it really doesn t matter too much what kind of character you make because the party members that you pick up throughout the game pretty much have everything covered One small warning without giving too much away in your travels you will meet a party member and in order to explore his backstory you will need your main character to have a decent rank in the repair skill It s not really a big deal if you re set on making a Soldier Jedi Guardian that is amazing in melee combat but will not be able to raise that skill too much But for you perfectionists that like to explore every single aspect of the game you should keep this in mind And another note to you perfectionists you will not explore every aspect of the game in one run This is because your actions throughout the game will determine whether you become a hero for the Light Side of the Force or fall to the Dark Side Naturally there are two different endings And I imagine that the game experience is a bit different as well I personally stuck to the Light Side which can be a little more difficult at times since you ll be helping people more However this also means that you will do more side quests I imagine that the Dark Side would be somewhat of a guilty pleasure as you can just kill people that seek your aid and you can progress through the game a little faster by taking the quick and easy path There is also the third option of pretty much balancing yourself and being neutral Respond as an evil Sith occasionally and sometimes as a valiant Jedi And you can usually respond neutrally as well Overall I d say that the aspect of this game that shines the brightest is the story and the characterization that takes place this is another reason to stick with the Light Side oftentimes you can just tell your party members to shut the hell up and gain dark side points but you won t get to explore their backstories and discover their motivations Anyone that is a Star Wars fan will thoroughly enjoy playing a game with a story that is nearly on par with the movies and even better than the prequels Obviously the story is a bit restricted since it IS a video game and meant to be played but the plot is certainly better than any video game I ve played before and when I was younger I did play games like Golden Sun and Baldur s Gate KOTOR beats them hands down And most of it is pretty new territory as the game takes place a few thousand years before the movies I ll close with a few warnings First you d better have a good graphics card if you want to play this game You should be fine if you meet the minimum system requirements but the first time I tried to install this game on my older computer still not that old though it didn t have a good enough graphics card The computer that it s on now still doesn t meet the recommended system requirements but it s more or less fine That leads me into my final warning there are some bugs with the game After only a few hours at a certain point the game would freeze up and occasionally exit to Windows I was worried that I wouldn t be able to complete the game because it happened many times I downloaded the updates for the game and this did help some but it didn t completely solve the problem Eventually I turned off something silly like grass effects or shadows and that caused it to happen much less frequently I guess all that is left to say is that if you re a Star Wars fan you should buy this game Even if you re not it s still worth playing through especially if you like RPG s Oh and this goes without saying but quick save often 
This is the best game ever The reason I liked this game so much was the story line It gives you choices to whether you want go to the light side or dark side and you could enhance a variety of Jedi powers I have played this game serveral times and each time is different The first time I went through this game I relied a lot on my swordsmanship with my lightsaber The second time I played this game I relied more on my Jedi powers Either way you play it I developed a different set of moves It was awesome Also I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PLAY A WOMAN In every other Star Wars Game except this sequel you have to play a man and it gets a little irritating when you like adventure games just as much as any guy I give the story line and the capabilities of the Jedi FIVE STARS 
If you like Star Wars buy this game If you dont like Star Wars buy this game Seriously though this game is awesome I bought this game simply because I had heard it was good and I am glad I did The plot is great actually worthy to bear the star wars name The story is what makes this game great and the ending is satisfying It has everything tons of action and fighting emotional dialogue lots of choices and even a few occasional hints of romance The basic story is this and don t worry I wont tell you too much You are a soldier for the republic that gets involved in the rescue of a Jedi who you develop a kind of mysterious bond with Through out the game you travel to several planets including Tatooine Kashyyyk Dantooine and several new ones never mentioned in the original movies 
one of the best I recived KOTOR for christmas I was skeptical the front picture was strange to me I popped it in installed and started playing Three weeks later I was completely into it It is one of the funnest games that I have ever played The missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars RPG ranking up there with World of Warcraft and other hyper popular RPGs 
It makes a HUGE difference When it comes to the GC GBA Cable You wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games But it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in Gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing Depending on the game and what features it opens up Plus it is cheap to get and once you ve gotten this wonderful item You will wonder why you didnt get it sooner I know from my own experience 
tooooooo cooooooool This cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy player on Final Fantas 
Very good I found this product good i have no problems with it what so ever some people say just buy a dvd player but then you have more wires in the back of your tv Also if you want your x box and dvd player to go into one suround sound or stereo the is great cause you get to have a dvd player and a x box in one wire going into the speakers this is also great if you dont want to spend any more money on buying another dvd player and you already have a xbox i have my xbox upstairs with the dvd adapter and a dvd player down stairs so if i want a change of secnery i love my xbox and it s adapter i have no problem with the remote either 
Nintendo RPGs have always been and will always be my favorites I haven t finished this game though I m quite close to it I have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that I ve had in a long time I laughed out loud more than a few times was nearly constantly smiling and was thoroughly amused with all the little details Not much stylus action but then again did you really expect there to be My boyfriend s highly considering getting a DS Lite simply so he can play this game 
Funnest Game on any platform I loved this game I played all the way through The difficulty level is low to medium I love games like this Instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through It kept my interest Had good gameplay and graphics Didn t annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again I loved it I also loved the Mario and Luigi prequel to this on GBA It s kinda of a light RPG with action elements I wish they made all RPG s like this It s short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition Give it a shot It s a lovely game 
Awesome Game I m so glad I listened to the fine reviewers on Amazon and bought this game it was worth every penny and then some It has a lot of really great game play and I love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks I feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters you wouldn t feel right about Mario and Luigi casting spells like the characters from Final Fantasy but it s perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells And as weird as that sounds it makes for a great RPG Lots of good side missions too like collecting the beans Wonderful game 
wow At first playing a Star Wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks This game is incredible It is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it Buy this game and put your blasters on full 
Play as jedis Yoda Obi Wan Darth Vader General Grevious and Ki Adi Mundi In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the Republic s side And you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier And you have the opportunity to do instant action That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as Also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it s really boring This game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile So get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen Also Yoda is awesome 
Great game for a 5 year old Spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played It was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating There are alot of Xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old This game was not meant for an adult gaming audience I was surprised when I realized this game is no longer in production There should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket My son loves this game He literally wore it out I have to find him another copy of Hero s Tail to replace his old one 
pantera Rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games 
The Beginning of the best game ever I have all the Grand Theft games and this is one of my favs I highly recommend it and all the others I recently purchased Liberty City Awesome 
A great way to release stress The best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city Fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars If you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the Internet then this is where the fun really begins These secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank this is only listing a few As always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old 
All 4 my son I ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store Little did I know that I actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here He loves it He actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well It was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own We are very pleased with this purchase 
Amazing You can read that the Eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but I just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your PC by just plugging it into your computer s USB port 
What s the point of moving Seriously You could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth That is a perfect way of cheating The game is not bad after all 
Good workout but camera issues I wanted this workout game to get back into shape after having a baby It is a great workout including cardio combat isolation for abs arms or legs and mind and body including yoga and tai chi type exercises I love that it tells you what day to work out and if you don t you fail that day and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive A which is hard to achieve and it should be I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year I love that Nike helped produce the game I recommend this game to anyone however I have issues with the eyetoy camera You would think I would get how the camera works after 8 weeks but I still have problems Sometimes it indicates that I touched something I was nowhere near and sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries for it to register that I touched something You re still getting the workout but I m working towards getting a good letter grade I want credit for what I m doing right The combat exercises are frustrating as I have a hard time believing I m not punching hard enough and often receive a 0 score I ve started working out at night as the sunlight from the windows makes the camera less responsive There have been a couple of times that I ve walked to the left of the screen and my body triggered the try again button after a cardio workout so I had to do the 10 minute workout again as history has shown when I try to exit out of it the game fails me for the day for quitting All in all I m happy with the workouts but just know that the camera takes some getting used to I hope others have better luck with it than I have My husband does the 12 week program also and he s lost 10 pounds and I ve lost 9 
Phenomenal Product Wow that s all I can say All the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this game Just got it a few days ago and am SO IMPRESSED with all that s packed into it It also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises This is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen People of all fitness levels can enjoy this This technology interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts has got to be the wave of the future 
Total body work out without the high monthly fees of a gym Got this for Christmas and absolutely love it It works for everyone on any work out level even for beginners There are two types of work out 1 Routine Builder basically you are on your own you get to pick exercises you are interested in 2 Personal Trainer basically you follow a 12 week program It tracks your progress it tells you when it is your rest day to avoid over exhaustion it has a guide advice on proper posture breathing and technique It has a good amount of stretching exercises in the beginning and end of each sessions It even enhances balance of mind and body very much like yoga It also combines fluid movements like Tai Chi rhythmic dance moves and kick boxing moves Needless to say I love this game If you re looking for a good sweat without the high fees of the gym this is the game for you 
Excellent software I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it The software is very well done and it really does have real time feedback If I m leaning forward when I m not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say try standing up straight I am definitely getting a great work out 10 more weeks and I ll let you know if it did any good or not So far it seems to be helping I love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense The one drawback is the camera is really sensitive I have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score If you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer Kinetic seems to be the way to go 
GREAT WORKOUT In case your new to the ps2 eye toy It is one cool toy THis is the perfect entry into the eye toy market as well Kenetic is lots of fun and you get a great workout Best of all you get feedback as to how well you are doing I am talking stats as to how well you performed today and relative to other outings All in all it is a great purchase The camera is placed on top of your tv and then projects your image onto the screen Throughout the game you have to do various tasks with your body to move objects around on the screen This is worth it if you are looking for a solid title for the eye toy or if you are just looking for a great workout 
Probably the best the DS has to offer Final Fantasy III as most may know was the only Final Fantasy game that failed to reach North America Well now it haas been revived and it s better than ever before The improved 1 Final fantasy has pushed the DS s graphics to the limit Though the figures may not be crystal clear and though it may seem slightly pixelish it s probably the best you ll ever get for the Nintendo DS FFIII is completely 3D a step up from it s original and the character changes appearence as you change his her job 2 The job system is what solely drives this game As some may have read yes there are 279841 different party combinations Obviously this opens up many doors and many strategy FFIII incorperates these 23 jobs in a smart way as well Don t be suprised when some job adjustments must be made to defeat a certain boss Your party can be all fighting or all magic all range or all skills or a mix of any Jobs are earned when crystals are discovered and you will find a use for each of them 3 FFIII can be played entirely with the touch screen or entirely with the buttons so you can use either method whenever you want FFIII complements the DS s touch screen capability quite nicely being able to use it to select moves is much better than the buttons 4 FFIII is also Wi Fi compatible In it players can send messages to other players global using an internet port It isn t much but it s something 5 You may name all of your characters and play as any or them any time I like that freedom The things that could be better 1 The story line is very redundant and a copy of previous FF games It isn t a big deal but you d think tthey d get a bit more original 2 The command buttons during battle are very small so using the touch screen often makes you mis hit a command 3 This game requires lots of patience because the battles are very tedious sometimes and most gameplay is spent traing 4 Each job doesn t have a variety of skills but rather only one It gets very old once you maintain the same job for a long time 5 THe Wi_Fi isn t very creative and there is no 2 player in FFIII 6 FIghts do not incorperate time bars That is to say you can take 5 years to make a move without an attack from an enemy To make it short and sweet Die hard FF fans must get this game mainly to complete their FF colections but also for a great time Not a die hard fan No worries The RPG is the best you ll find on the DS or PSP It s got plenty to do and won t fail you at any time Those who don t enjoy strategy games however or do not have the patience to grow their characters may want to stay away from this game I loved it but hey it s just what I think This review was brought to you by the son of Having Fun 
Welcome home The much hyped about Final Fantasy III for the DS is finally here and DS owners and FF fans alike should be clicking their heels Now let me start off by saying that this is not the Final Fantasy III you played loved and worshipped on the Super Nintendo years ago that game is being re released as Final Fantasy VI Advance on the GBA eventually hopefully This instead is the real FF III which never made it here from overseas and it has been remade and restructured to fit perfectly for Nintendo s smash hit handheld The graphics have been given a big facelift and that s saying it lightly The character sprites have been replaced with full on 3 D effects that look great for a DS game and the storyline has been tweaked as well Everything else about FF III is an old school RPG gamer s dream come true even if the touch screen features feel tacked on and unnecessary Everything else about FF III though is a pure delight and the Wi Fi features are nice to say the least All in all DS owners looking for an excellent RPG to pass the time should look no further their prayers have been answered 
Complete the Final Fantasy Collection After sixteen long years Final Fantasy III finally sees an official release outside of Japan However unlike previous games Final Fantasy III has been completely reworked This is more than just a port with enhanced graphics Final Fantasy III includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul Final Fantasy III may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans but was the wait really worth it Well yes but the game isn t perfect The storyline of Final Fantasy III is entirely too simple The crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness Sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story but when compared to your average RPG today and current Final Fantasy games the storyline to Final Fantasy III is a joke There s nothing in this story that screams epic and the characters involved aren t developed very well Luckily we can let it slide because its sixteen years old Gameplay wise Final Fantasy III is pretty similar to most RPGs of today You ll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles There are a few quirks to the game that the DS utilizes You ll find moments where you ll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine It should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game Using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to by gliding it across the screen Taping on things makes your character examine it and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people It works out but it feels really clumbsy at times If you re looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle just stick to the directional buttons To its credit though using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster but for the most part the stylus controls just feel tacked on Combat is traditional turn based combat There s no ATB gauge like in later Final Fantasy games In each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do and then watch a round of battle take place It s simple but isn t always fun Mainly because Final Fantasy III is a challenge If you began with some of the later Final Fantasy games then this installment may be a little too difficult Sometimes combat is unforgiving especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn and have the power to take out a character in a single shot Even worse the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you ll fail so many times trying to do so You ll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times There are several moments when you ll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up This is fine for those used to old school RPGs but many RPGs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up and it may try your patience after a while It s great for people looking for a challenge at least but for some it may be a bit too steep The job system is interesting As you go through the game you ll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs Each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it For example White mages specialize in the healing arts black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both You ve also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members thieves who can steal and much more There are 23 jobs in all and the possibilities are nearly endless The jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats Mages for example don t have a lot of strength but they excel in magic Also as you gain levels you ll also gain job levels So it s not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level but also at a good job level The game looks absolutely stunning at least for the Nintendo DS It is by far one of the best looking out there There are some moments where it looks pixilated but you can t deny that the game just looks good regardless The movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well In battle is also fantastic Your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle On the whole the game just looks good Perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat Your characters won t physically go up and strike an enemy Rather they just step forward and swing Very similar to how the Final Fantasy games of the NES worked It s strange to see but you ll quickly get used to it Another thing that seems kind of strange though is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank All the action takes place on the bottom screen There are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything You ll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you re in towns There are certain moments where the top screen has text or shows an important story sequence but that s usually about it Other than that when trumping through dungeons as you do often and in battle as you also do often the top screen remains blank There s nothing wrong with it but it feels very awkward to play a Nintendo DS game where the top screen is blank They could ve used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something The top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever The music in the game is pretty good though It s not as good as other games in the series and there are some tunes that just aren t great but the music is by no means bad There s no voice acting in the game really but we can let that slide Audio wise the game is good Final Fantasy III is a pretty satisfying experience for any Final Fantasy fan looking for a good challenge and to see how far the series has come However it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas particularly its unforgiving challenge Still it s worth it for Final Fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come The Good +Finally a chance to play Final Fantasy III +Great visual look +Good music +The job system is interesting +It provides a good challenge +A fair amount of secrets and sidequests The Bad The story is not all that great For some the game might provide too much of a challenge to the point of frustration High random encounter rate Throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just blank for a Nintendo DS game this just feels awkwar 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES FOR THE PS2 This game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay This game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is For example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them Some a lot more complicating than others And theres os many colossus that it takes a long time to beat them all So overall this game is great 
Great adventure but might be too simple for some Pros Awesome graphics Huge world to explore Great story line Easy to play You could to kill colossal enemies Cons All you do is kill the 16 Colossi There are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the Battle attack 
A Colossal Achievement Ico was a game that was very different from others It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio Imagine what Ico would be if action were incorporated into it you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus Ico s prequel SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels Presentation You stand in front of a deceased woman whose identity is unknown and are told that by defeating 16 colossi that roam the land you may be able to revive her but it may come at a price This sets up the shroud of mystery that surrounds SoTC as you start your journey You are given nothing but bows arrows a sword and your trusty horse Agro Graphics The land is sometimes colorful but it s supposed to be desolate so you won t see much life here The real kudos goes to the animation that occurs during the boss bottles Different motion blur affects really bring the game to a new level of realism And Agro s animation is also cinema worthy as well Gameplay The meat and potatoes of SoTC is the gameplay Ride on your steed in the direction of the colossus and begin to battle You have 2 bars grip strength and health Grip determines how long you can hold on to things such as the colossi themselves The best part of gameplay isn t done with your hands but your mind Each colossus is a puzzle that must be solved It can be determining it s weak spot or even how to get on the thing The colossus are so varied that each one will keep you guessing as to what to do next While it will be hard it will be one of the funnest experiences you ve ever had Audio Some of the same tracks are repeated throughout here but they never grow old The music seems to match the mood When you ve just met the colossus you ll hear soft music while you figure out what to do Then the music will rise as you mount the beast All the pieces in here sound good and are great pieces Overall When you ve beaten it and picked your jaw off the ground from the surprise ending it s not over yet You have time attack mode and hard mode which can be used to collect a few unlockables While such modes seem trivial to me I did mention that this was an extremely fun experience so even I had to go through it again This is an absolutely no brainer get Shadow of the Colossus now 
Jesus Christ this is a fantastic game In the days where people play games to shoot random people and other stuff It s nice to know there s still art in videogames I loved this game My brother heard about it and I rented it soon after Wow Graphics 10 10 Lovely LOVELY BEAUTIFUL Enough said Sound 20 10 Music is so pretty I love the orchestral going on Story 7 10 The average Save the princess game Controls 8 10 Hard to deal with the horse Easy when walking Overall 9 10 This is a beautiful game but it s upsetting it s so short I can easily say this game introduced me into full on puzzle games It does have something to do with Ico but no one really knows if it s a prequel a sequel or anything 
Good with one major flaw This game is really good but i don t think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long So if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game 
great communicator this communicator is the best i have ever used i own a game center and play video games for extended amounts of time it remains comfortable tha phoeni 
Best Headset Headset is awesome Fits very snug on your ear and does not irritate over time Has crystal clear 2 4ghz channel 9 Hours of game time and only takes at the most 1 5 hours to charge Gaming is a lot more fun 
Really Great Really nice headset except for the fact that if your a gamer that spends alot of time on Xbox Live with this headset on it can start to hurt a little bit You can adjust the volume from barely being able to hear the person or basically to making it seem like they are yelling Very small and it does plug into the charger very well if someone says that they have to hold it in with a rubber band or tape then they messed it up somehow because the headset stays in nice and firm This is a MUST for people that cannot stand a cord getting in their way for their headset on xbox live or XB Connect Xlink It has VERY good range i can walk outside with the door closed about 50 or so steps away and i still get reception Overall if you have a Xbox and want to talk to other people online get this headset it is very nice 
Looks Fab I do not own the headset yet but I have already ordered it from amazon and It is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so I will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes My impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous The price Great price I got mine for somthing like 25 buy from abuy4u but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset Yes 6 hours can last me a weekend 
Great Product Best Solution for wireless XBox First things first there IS a mute button on this unit If a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off I m guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either didn t read the instructions or couldn t figure out a product with three buttons on it power mute volume up and volume down Second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a Logitech wireless controller It works well and I noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular XBox communicator 
It s cool PROS 1 Wireless 2 Small 3 Lightweight 4 You can talk to your friends when you re in the bathroom 5 It has a lot of noises to tell you it s turning on and off and when the volume is at its max CONS 1 Cliking and poping noises 2 My charger doesn t connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 There is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 Have to charge it why can t it just have a fuel cell 5 No mute statis or indicator 6 It makes poping noises and a white nois 
Double Dash Is Fast and Fun I love this game it is so much fun Even though my wife does not like it I recommend this game for anyone who like Mario Kart games Enjoy the races and don t forget to blow your friends up 
The best game ever This is the best game ever If you want to play with your love ones this is the best game to have with You can be addicted to it sometimes but that s a good sign for a good gam 
Mario s back and he s brought some freinds Mario Kart Double Dash is essentially Mario Kart 64 and then some The game brings alot of new cards to the table which I will review below Mario Kart Double Dash has improved on the last game immensely and that is saying alot because Mario Kart 64 was one of the most fun games available for the N64 The first way it improved on the previous game was allowing players to choose 2 characters to race with instead of 1 This makes for a bit more of a complex control scheme but otherwise doubles the fun The game also features tons of available characters to play as Mario Luigi Peach Daisy Wario Walluigi Bowser Baby Bowser Koopa Paratroopa Baby Mario Baby Luigi Donkey Kong Diddy Kong Yoshi and Birdo The game has the ol Grand Prix mode and the Time Trials but it also has some new unlockable features such as New carts New characters A new circuit New battle mode stages and more but I don t want to spoil anything Mario Kart Double Dash s multiplayer modes are better than ever too Not only are battle and versus modes once again available but there are new types of battles shine theif and babomb blast All in all Mario Kart Double Dash is extremely fun and replayable and has enough features and unlockables to keep you occupied and entertained for a while I enjoy it and I think any Gamecube owner should pick this game up I reccomend renting it first to see if you like it and then making your decision Thanks for reading bubba samus 
Gta Liberty City Stories This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It s Sort Of Like A Prequal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don t Own A Psp I d Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn t Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA 
Amazing I know I m a little late but what the heck I felt like writing a review for this game Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game Simple as that Its extremely deep has a fantastic story great characters great battle system and it s the perfect length for a RPG 45 55 hours Not everyone likes Tidus be he honestly doesn t bother me and I think he is a interesting character The rest of the cast is well developed and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe The cast is very memorable you ll remember them for years to come and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for so that doesn t disapoint The gameplay is extremely fun and its actually one of my favorite battle systems The battle system can make or break a RPG and this one doesn t disappoint Its fast paced so it doesn t get bogged down by long battles You can also swap characters mid battle thats a awesome feature The gameplay is also incredibly deep I ve heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game So if thats your thing I m sure you ve probably already played this game If for some reason you have not played this game and your into RPG s don t hesitate to pick this game up its cheap now and its one of the best and most balanced RPG s I ve ever played 
A New Standard in Console RPGs Without a Doubt FFX is one of the best if not the best rpgs to come out on any of the current consoles It features an incredible and orignal story populated with interesting and varied characters Additionally the sphere gird system allows the player to develop character abilites in an interesting and innovative manner Admittedly the sphere grid system complexilty may scare away rpg newbies but with a little time will become second nature to players of all skill levels Featuring a wonderful score even by Final Fantasy standards and impressive graphics for the PS2 there is little reason for any video game fan not to pick up this title even with the ever present advent of FF 12 on the horizon 
Absolutely Awesome game I have to say this is a game that was worth every dollar spent It s a game that I will keep for life and probably play again someday I don t know what the previous Final Fantasy games were like so for me there is no comparison I think I m totally biased toward Final Fantasy X The two coolest aspects about this game for me are the Aeons and Blitzball The other thing I like about this game is the storyline the characters and the beautiful scenary I forgot to mention how great the music is also I ve been reading reviews about current and previous Final Fantasy games and the thing that is still missing for me is the Aeons and Blitzball I m also attached to the characters in Final Fantasy X Even the sequel doesn t cut it for me right now For me it s Final Fantasy X all the way 
French Connection meets Mario For those who have the time and patience to learn the ins and outs of this it is great realistic racing My favorite part though is going one on one in trying to outrun the cops It is wild and very reminicent of the famous chase scenes from French Connection I and II Playing this way never fails to draw an audience from whoever s in the house at the time and they end up getting wrapped up in it too cheering from the sidelines with enthusiastic advice like Look out Watch out for the road block ahead You ve lost him etc If you re not playing it is still great to watch p s I initially bought this for my son and got hooked watching him play 
NFS Most Wanted NFS Most Wanted is ok but there are a few things I don t like about it The variety of cars is mediocre and the controls are horrible How can you eliminate the old fashioned way of control by using the pad I absolutely hated that The amount of vehicles is horrible only 37 In NFS Hot Pursuit 2 there were close to 50 I am not thrilled with the tuning feature and what s the deal with the NOS The way I see it if you need NOS on your car then your car isn t fast enough I like the police AI that s just incredible and the 3d models of the vehicles are incredible The gameplay is great and the combining of the elements from Hot Pursuit 2 Underground and Underground 2 helps the game but the variety of the cars hinders it 
THIS GAME DESERVES AN OSCAR This game is the best I have ever gotten I ve got in Pin The Tail On The Ed But I can t seem to get pass the hard parts Also THIS GAME DESERVES AN OSCAR 
Burnout 3 Takedown I rented this game before I bought and liked it so much I just had too buy it 
Crash Bang Boom Yeah it s all there For all of you out there who love destruction Who love seeking sweet revenge on someone who knocks you out of a lap or tosses your sorry butt into the drink this is the game for you One of the basic foundations of this game is destruction Even when you re knocked around beaten down crushed humiliated and etc you gain points with the craziness of your crash There are a few different race modes Some of which can get a little tedious but it s all well worth it It s a bit challenging sometimes it seems like there is no way you ll be able to make that time limit or create enough damage but as you play you will find the way It s extremely easy to sit down with the controller in your hand and look up at the clock four hours down the road It s a very addictive game but is great fun I would recommend this game to anyone who is a racing fan Without a question a 5 star game 
Worth the wait What a great time you can have in Rome The basic gameplay is intuitive There isn t a lot you haven t done before The interface is pretty standard and can be minimized off the screen for screenshots or just zooming around without distraction As with all these types of games you can spend a lot of time building and developing You need to take some time enjoying this one for the closeup views of the city at work and at play is what is so new here The graphics look somewhat standard on a zoom out top down view There is a lot that looks familiar Until you start to get a closer look and the texture details come to life and you realize there is another level of realism here as you watch the shadows lengthen along the plaza near the sparkling fountain as the midday sun moves across the sky and the trees sway in the breeze Wow No other Roman game out currently comes close This has everything you always wanted with Caesar III and had somewhat with CoTN Children of the Nile although the buildings here are more substantial and better realized I would have liked to see more decorative options and more variety in housing and goods you can produce It s part of the appeal and adds to the longevity and continued interest in the game But what there is is very good indeed All of the structures are beautifully done with attention to detail The landscape can be breathtaking with a variety of ways to put your city together around the terrain And enough hustle and bustle on the city streets to bring it to life And did I mention that you can zoom all the way down INTO an arena or colliseum watch closeups of the games or swivel around from the floor of the arena and watch all the spectators coming in and out and moving around or cheering A lot of thought went into this game by people who love what they do There are some bugs with the trade routes Hopefully these will be addressed soon In the meantime avoid placing the ports or depots before you have goods in stock for those routes The maps are overall somewhat small although a game this graphic intensive would have to reasonably limit the size to facilitate performance There are very limited sandbox modes available at least for now and I can find no user created scenarios currently available due in part to the complexity of the unsupported editor I am currently running a mid line gaming system with a NVidia 6800 a system that can run Oblivion fairly well I had to update some drivers as well as defragment my hard drive to run this game smoothly I hadn t experienced many lags until I had built up a larger city or had been playing for several hours and my system started to protest While it may have a few faults most things are a matter of preference and having an adequate clean system The core game itself is fundamentally solid It takes work to build up economic stability based on trade and taxes and how well you handle your production chains You can create with any scenario stable cities that will largely run themselves aside from the requests demands from the Empire With the stable gameplay depth realistic economic simulation great music and breathtaking graphics it s not only a very good game but the best of the current selection of Roman city builders So if you have to chose I would recommend this one first Enjoy 
Run Don t Walk This game did what the prequels couldn t for me it drew me back into the Star Wars universe with a vengence I am not a real big gamer and really don t like console games but this game is a must have for any fan casual or hardcore Knights also comes in a PC version for those who don t have access to a console or like me don t really care for them In fact the PC version has more Mods available for it I believe so I would probably recommend it first Knights or Kotor as it is known in the fan community is set 4000 years before A New Hope It s the sweeping tale of a talented Padawan who comes late to the Force and holds the fate of the galaxy in their hands Since this is an RPG the best part is the Jedi is YOU What really drew me to this game was the well developed storyline and the flushed out characters The other members of you party have backstorys that play directly into the plot in the form of sidequests during the course of the game You almost feel like they are real and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to the party memebers as the story progressed Their responses are also influenced by your dialog choices and can even affect the main character s relationships with the other party members This is a Bioware game as well so there is the option to romance one of the other party members You can also choose which side of the Force to follow The player can either be the quintessential Light Jedi evil as Palpatine or somewhere inbetween Your choices throughout the game affect your alignment in the Force and also what powers are less exhausting to use The dialog is fantastic and rarely comes off as cheesy unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless and the voice actors who portray the other characters are wonderful Even the dialog for the main character has the option to be funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment The game gives you the choice to play as a male or female character which actually influences what side quests you can pick up as well as having a minor effect on the main story Personally I thought this was the most gratifying aspect of the game I got to play as a kickin female Jedi who holds the fate of the galaxy in her hands Due to this as well as the ability to choose your alignment there are four possible endings to this game Knights has been able to hold an excellent replay factor as well due to the number of Mods available for the game from other fans LucasArts actually encourages and even supports fan mad mods on thier website When you get bored with the main storyline there are mods out there that change everything from looks to clothes to Force Powers and even dialog There s even a Mod out there that restores the cut fifth ending that was only available as a female character The game mechanics are pretty easy to get a handle on The combat options give you the ability to either choose what attacks each character in your party use or leave them automated Those who aren t real familiar with computer games should be able to pick up the basics fairly fast Those who like first person shooters may find it a little frustrating as the attacks themselves are automated For me this was a plus as I m not a fan of button smashers A work of advice to someone who hasn t played the game or isn t familiar with it s storyline avoid searching on the internet for info on it as much as possible This may be frustrating if you are someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me the storyline s twist is not something you want to spoil You ll enjoy the game storyline much more if you don t spoil the surprise There are gaming sites where you can get cheats and only cheats if your a cheater like me Not only will teen players enjoy it but I know plenty of 20 and 30 somethings who adore this game It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Original Trilogy If you like Star Wars at all run don t walk and buy this game 
The Force is strong with this one After playing this game for 16 days I finally finished it after 91 hours of game play I now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards it is just that good Try not to breeze your way right through it though or you ll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience Take your time and enjoy it Not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy this game requires you to think befor you do things It really is a fun game to play And overall that s what playing games are all about having fun 
Lucas Arts at it s best First point thankfully this wasn t directed by good ole George The setting of the game is 4 000 years before the Star Wars A New Hope and a few years after the devastating Mandolorian Wars This a truly fun Role Playing Game RPG including interesting characters everone of them with unique histories including yours an almost flawless turn based combat system a sinister universe dominating villian ect At this point the graphics aren t the greatest but are still nothing to scoff at There are some bugs with the dialogue and movies but nothing serious The music produced by the gaming world famous Jeremy Soule is amazing and completely allows the player to become immersed with gameplay Basically every action mostly dialogue has a good Light Side Neutral and bad Dark Side outcome For some reason the dark side way of going about things is more fullfilling Many movie seen force powers lightning force choke as well as some powers known to Knights of the Old Republic KOTOR are included keeping you on your toes while playing Spoiler Alert Incredilby it is a small universe all of the characters you meet that become apart of your party have to do with your past self Over At two parts of your journey once in the begining and once more a fourth of the way in the player gets to choose the class of his her character First time around what kind of grunt of the Old Republic s are you and second what kind of SUPER ALL POWERFUL KICK A BITE YOUR HEAD OFF Jedi are you One of the best XBox games ever period and one of the better RPGs out there as well 
Forget the movies This game defines Star Wars greatness Story 10 10 Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic puts you in a world of complete bliss and utterly fantastic awe This is not just a shoot em up game for within the millions of pixelated characters lies a story A story with jaw dropping mind blowing twists and turns and conclusions awaiting Choose your path for the first time you can choose your own destiny rather than the creators This game is not just one plot nor is it a mindless adventure trekking the whereabouts of the middle of nowhere looking for purpose No this game is many a quests and riddles illusions and games inside to keep the gamers on their tippy toes at all times Starting out as a mysterious rebel who does not know his her own past fight or peacefully sneak your way through the depths of several planets each carrying many people with many stories You may help these people you may be there savior and deny a reward or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls to create your path to the dark side All the while making the venture across native lands toward beoming a Jedi encounter friends enounter foes and convert them to friends if you ever so wish It doesn t matter because in the end it s only you facing the evil sith lord toe to toe lightsaber to lightsaber Gameplay 9 10 The fighting system is somewhat random but not entirely you can choose to create a concrete combat fighter or a wizard casting spells such as lighting wind life draining lightsaber throwing etc Many different various skills such as stealth persuasion even computer hacking and lockpicking Sort of You can stay close using lightsabers one in each hand or a double bladed one Or you stray afar using blaster rifles and pistols You have many compainions droids jedis dark side mercenaries and wookies each with a charming dramatic or brutal life story which will only be concluded as the game furthers on Very impressive dialogue and screenwriting graphics and realism are also mediocre I can guarantee with the low 20 price this game will give you hours of fun each day for at least a month And trust me when that month is up you will not want to get rid of it you will get the urge to play it again because once you start this game you are hooked on a long term engagement The only thing I find wrong with this game is it s sequel Pros Excellent sound effects dialogue screenplay scenery designing and story writing Hundreds of weapons armor with belts gloves arm bands implants and masks to further increase skills Hundreds of side quests with extravagant rewards and conclusions that will keep you in awe all day long No wondering from world to world in search of plots they are usually easy to find but challenging not boring to accomplish No matter what you can always play the game a different way so you would be just beginning your quest as soon as you beat the game Neat little area from xbox live downloadable content which can open up another plot and give you VERY nice weapons and two new lightsaber colors Turquoise orange You can change the overall game difficulty it s default setting is medium Cons No type of multiplayer games in any circumstance It s surprising they didn t make a co operative option Sometimes annoying loading transitions can take maybe 10 15 seconds at most I d advise having some music handy if it s your 2nd or 3rd time through the game 
Best Handheld by Far The ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today The black color is a really nice option too I think it looks much more elegant The only complaint I can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black 
Nintendo DS Great Entertainment I bought the white one for my 7 year old son but could never tear it away from his hands so I got my own Too bad they haven t invented a calendar appointment software for us big kids The only negative is the white one gets dirty very easily would recommend buying the black instead 
Awesome I love this thing It s awesome The older version of DS was a little clunky and childish looking This thing rocks my socks off It s sleek sexy and portable It s like an iPod of video games You don t have to buy batteries It comes with an extra stylus Its screen is brighter The sound is stereo This thing is super dope It s the freshest thing out there You gotta get one Sell your old DS on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one You ll love it 
Railroad Tycoon Sequel This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon If you loved the old 1990 s original you ll enjoy this one as well Only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited 
Great remake of the original Railroad Tycoon I ve never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game A number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in Railroads as compared to RRT3 which is absolutely correct If you are seeking a complex simulation Railroads is not the game for you If however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then I wholeheartedly recommend Railroads It is one of my favorite games of all time 
XBOX WIRELESS MINI VALUE PAK INTEC THE BEST SET OF WIRELESS CONTROLLERS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY XBOX SYSTEM THE CONTROLLERS ARE NICELY FITTED FOR COMFORTABLE USE AND DOES NOT CRAMP UP YOUR HANDS AFTER HOURS OF PLAY CONNECTS GREAT AND NO INTERRUPTIONS WHILE GAME PLAYING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE THAT IS LOOKING TO BUY CONTROLLERS OUT THERE THEY ARE AWESOME LOOKING GREAT FOR PLAYING HALO 2 I USE IT ALOT WITH THIS GAME AND IT IS THE BOMB PLUS MY RANKING HAS GONE UP SINCE USING IT WHILE PLAYING ON XBOX LIVE 
WHY IS IT A GOOD GAME There are alot of reasons so you dumb people that rtae it low probably never played it heres why i think its great WHY ITS GREAT fun in editor to just mess around no need to test map to have people fight many units that can make diffrent stratadgies god powers are great many mythical units that make the game unique the Titans are crazzzzy you beat the campaign well download the new free one online go to the main website of AOM =D =D =D beat every campagin that exsists You can still play online make many skirmish wars and even make your own campaigns many fun maps can be easy or hard depending what difficulty s you choose so its great for everyone new armies gods powers all that good stuff = So basically this games greta buy it actually better yet buy the gold edition which has this expansion and the original which you need to use the expansion HAVE FUN 
Age of Mythology is Awesome My son is enthralled with this game He is learning while being entertained The graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC What more could we ask for 
The Titans A great improvment on an Excellent game Only disappointment is that you can t access the same titans from the campaign in the quick game and that the titans aren t named I think that they should be afterall they are Gods I d also like to see a patch that gives you access the the Norse Giant Hero He was pretty cool But the Roles of the heros are great and The atlantean army is awesome 
It s okay but not as good as expected This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them but I am not one of them The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well but the plot to the campaign messes it all up The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun I was disappointed in the new campaign I d say the first one is better If you make a big deal about graphics though than this game is for you It has excellent graphics and features The ocean and mountain looks so realistic They do a good job showing you underwater These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series If you were expecting a good campaign your not going to be very happy Plot isnt so good and its very short It has about half of the other games campaigns A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out They re kind of annoying Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal Graphics 10 10 Campaign Plot 3 10 Music 6 10 Mythology 9 10 Overall 7 10 
Simply the best I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas He loves it and he s got me hooked The game is everything they say and more You will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like The only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered 
I Dont Have This Game But I ve played it countless times at the arcade and I think it is one of the best games for ps2 cause actually I m more of a PC gamer amd it is the best of it s kind If youre looking for a guncon game this is for you gameplay as i ve said BEST OF ITS KIND TC3 is one of the few guncon games that will keep you glued to the tv and in my case arcade screen for hours and hours and wont get repetitive and the multi weapon system will give you more strategy and less in a good way mindless crazy shooting For example if you were outnumbered in a closed space with a lot foes on the screen in any other guncon game youd have to shoot them all down one by one ducking like a madman and losing time but now youd just select the nade launcher aim and clear the area of enemies but the grenade launcher has a limited amount of ammo so would you spray with the uzi with a fast rate of fire or use the shotgun that spreads its bullets your choice but the strategy doesnt bore the game you still ave plenty of time to shoot people silly graphics the graphics arent like Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but its still isnt horrible and anyway you wont mind the graphics when youre really playing the game Sound the dialog is crappy like any other guncon game but everything else is above par and again you wont care about the sound when youre really playing the game story Not the best its predictable corny and it isnt complex at all but if you re looking for a great storyline in a guncon game you need serious help Overall the only flaws I could find were that the game was overpriced 60 and that the guncon is pretty fragile From what I ve heard Other than that its a must buy for anyone who likes shooting crazy action or wants to let their anger out on some terrorists 
Good for more than just entertainment I ve got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games I ve bought not that they were bad though The funny thing about these kind of games so long as you re using a light gun is that they improve your accuracy with firearms It s no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games Now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real But then again that is part of what gives the game it s charm Buy the game and a light gun 
flawless I have this memory card and Nyko s version of the same thing and this one is much more reliable I ve had it filled up nearly to the top with 950 blocks used out of the 1019 avaliable and it never lost or corrupted any of the data Great for Madden Football owners since it takes like 165 blocks of memory to save a franchise 
Lots of worlds to play with I bought this memory for my kids since hey were advancing in video playing and weren t able to save their achievements This memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels I think is the best out there 
If you like movies If you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game It is as if you are the star of the film But that also means that there are many cut scenes These cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic But there are those of you out there that don t liek cut scenes at all If this is the case for you reader don t buy this game If you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you can t go wrong with this game I have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price It is that good if you like cut scenes 
Weapons are nor allowed What makes it special is that it s the first PlayStation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device I gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive PS2 game 2 or 3 hours On the other hand there are several possible endings and a bonus game the game has a nostalgic atmosphere and the graphics are astonishing 
Bigger Is Better With Nintendo riding very high on the handheld gaming market with the Game Boy Advance they ve also shown their stuff with the success of the Nintendo DS as well and a newer recently redesigned version of the DS called the DS Lite These stylus pens are specifically for the Nintendo DS Lite only and work very well for all gamers They are simple to control and play around with for games like Magnetica New Super Mario Bros Tetris DS and many others The control of these pens are easy to use and handle for all gamers This is a absolute must for DS Lite owners Price A Convience A Overall 
Melissa Dude Supy gave this game a bad review Supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games It is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the Lemony Snicket movie The game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you re not a very skilled gamer like my 6 year old it s okay because if you die you just restart the task I have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating 
Great game based upon the movie I very much enjoyed this game and I think it may be my favorite X BOX game I own I Kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better One funny part about this game is the part where you are Sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off I reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable 
Unfortunately Short and Easy Book Fans Don t listen to Dude Supy because he most likely hasn t read the books This game is very fun but doesn t last very long at all If you like the books you should rent it You probably won t want to buy it though I rented it yesterday and beat it today Very fun but not for long 
STRONG GAME MORE OF THE SAME This game is alot like Call of Duty 2 The graphics are better than 2 The play is almost the same The online play is where the game thrives The online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game If you love shooters you will love this game 
another nazi shoot em up and yes its very good I am a huge fan of world war 2 first person shooters I ve been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor since then not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty It was a wonderfual game and still is Call of Duty 2 was even better Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on in a word yes Although it is alot more of the same But then again why mess with a great formula Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around sheer intensity and also alot of fun But then you might say well i ve played COD2 are you saying its the same Yes and No The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense Yea its the same game But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier Honestly these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360 I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score Oh and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more Seriously the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content meaning on the edge of your seat The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest the best that money can buy 
more Castlevania Another Castlevania game means more excitement Going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of Castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years I love the graphics They are truly something magnificent The special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch Just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a Castlevania game should be This game follows the formula that was featured in Symphony of the Night which means if you like the Metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well 
One of the Best DS games out there If you like 2 D side scrolling classic adventure games you ve gotta check this game out I m personally a big fan of 2 D animated sprite games especially now that they re getting more and more rare as they are converting everything to 3D Don t get me wrong I love 3D games too in fact I majored in 3D animation but 2 D games are what I grew up with and this one is definately a winner If you like any of the old or newer castlevania games you will love this game It has everything you ve come to expect and loved about the genre You ll also love it if you re into games like 2 D metroid mario zelda megaman and the like The graphics are amazing in this game and you can tell they spent plenty of time illustrating the subtle graphics and music for this game The backgrounds are gorgeous with rich detail too The game has a good balance of complexity and easy game play It s just complex enough to keep you interested and not overly complicated as to stress you out and spoil the fun This game may be too complex for kids 10 and under though There s lots of dialogue and lots of menu s and submenu s that may be too complex for kids under 10 unless your kid loves RPG games like final fantasy then this would be a breeze Pros Beautiful graphics rich detail fun game play lots of weapons and powers to absorb intuitive game design and menus huge world to explore and interesting big boss creatures did I mention the graphics are awesome Cons The top screen is used only to display map of world seems like they could ve integrated it more with the game Other than that I can t think of anything else Conclusion If you like 2 D or 3 D side scrolling adventure genre this is a must buy This may well be the best adventure game for the DS ever This game is especially hard to put down after you start playing it Was this review helpful Please vote thanks 
Nicely Done Konami If you are looking for an adventure game with action graphics and different ways of playing this is the game 
Great Game to Play My son is an avid Castlevania game player I bought this game for his birthday I asked him how he liked the game and these are a few of his comments He likes how it offers the use of the touch screen to shatter blocks that are in the way and also to draw symbols that open doors and help defeat certain boss monsters Some monsters have abilities that you can equip while others can be summoned to help you battle The game provides a good variety of weapons and armor There are hidden items and the challenge of getting all types of monster souls that makes the game more interesting He was planning on buying this game for himself and was very pleased to get it as a gift 
Great Platformer and Intriguing Storyline Castlevania is a series of games involving vampires and side scrolling combat With Dawn of Sorrows Soma Cruz is a teenager who has the soul of Dracula within him A year ago in the game before this one he had to fight off the dark powers within him He won and thought his life would be normal again Unfortunately when this game opens he immediately comes under attack and has to vanquish a new set of foes The game is a pixel based side scroller and involves human figures fighting skeletons werewolves and other monsters The look is definitely old school retro If for example you ran this side by side against Robots another title I reviewed recently the Robots figures were crisp and detailed while the Castlevania characters and screens showed a granularity It s a style difference that many people appreciate You primarily move left and right slashing with your sword throwing bones and performing other styles of attacks to take out your enemies There is some platforming as well jumping up and down ladders to get to new areas This works in well with a storyline so it s not like say Mario where the platforming is all there is to the game For example there s a hunter who has sworn to kill Dracula Soma knows about the hunter and understands that the hunter will have to fight him if he loses control of himself to Dracula They are enemies who have a truce and who both respect each other but who know if circumstances change they will have to lock in combat There are some touch screen aspects to the game You find seals which are in essence patterns of lines To perform certain actions for example to finish off a boss you have to create this seal This involves drawing that pattern perfectly You re allowed to practice but when the time comes if you don t get the seal done just right you could be in great trouble It s a neat idea but I wish it had been something a little less perfectionist oriented I know many people who just can t draw well or who have hands that shake a bit If they d gone with a memorization game or a logic puzzle or something it would be more about real skill intelligence and less about having perfectly steady hands In general I did like the fun action and I did appreciate the RPG and storyline here I got drawn into the story rather quickly I think for the next version I would like to see the graphics kicked up to match the DS capabilities the seal puzzle changed to be less about perfectionist drawing and I d also like some of the dialogue to be less cliche I loved the flow of the plot but winced at several of the comments made by characters Well recommended 
Great Game Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow was the first 2D version of castlevania that I had played in a long time Well to be onest the first one since Castlevania II Belmonts Quest came out on the NES back in the 80 s I never got to play Super Castlevania or the amazing PSX versions which I should have after playing this game and buying the 2 previous GBA games This was an amazing change ot the games for me in the original it was really hard to beat and made you frustrated II fixed it a little and made you search for Dracula s body and then destroy it but was frustrating as you had no real direction and most of the weapons tended to suck This however was an amazing game It eases you into the game you have a lot of HP at your disposal and can regain them take that 1980 s games quite often from potions or from a save point or souls The souls are a great thing and am loving it in the previous game as well They range from you not taking as much damage to growing a tail to shooting lightning or bombs and letting you throw a doll and switch places with it I enjoyed this game and was determined to finish it I don t currently have 100 but on my first time through I got 98 which is nice because I have played games through and you finish with 48 and you completed the entire game The touch screen is not used often in the game but when it is used it is used well You only need it to destroy a few blocks that are in the way and to input magic seals whihc you need to defeat the bosses and get through certain doors It plays great although you can cheat and not have to hit the points perfect as long as your are quick which is a good thing as most people are not perfectionists or if they are are really slow The game is difficult but not overbearing like many of the series have been in the past I loved this game and will play it for a long time even though I have beaten it before I will try Julius mode which is the more traditional difficult castlevania game using a Belmont finally with a whip no souls no potions it will be tough but I will enjoy it greatly If you own a DS you need to own this game 
Kid mastermind This game took my 9 year old son 2 days to complete It was a disappointment since I paid 30 for it but the action adventure games make younger kids to make wiser decisions Overall this game deserves an A+ Not an adult type game but fun for kids 
Incredible Awesome video games but a little strange things Story A family of super heroes battle against a weird bad guy named Syndrome Characters Mr Incredible Elastigirl Violet Dash Unplayable characters Jack Jack Frozone Syndrome Mirage Graphics OK but I really don t like the Apartment Inferno level because alot of the scenes most of them are dark and you can t see a thing Levels in order Bank Heist Skyline Strech Buddy Pine and Bomb Voyage Apartment Inferno Late for School Beach Landing Nomanisian Island Lava level with Omnidroid Robot Arena Great Falls Syndrome s Base Finding Mr Incredible 100 Mile Dash Violet s Crossing Secret Lava Falls Rocket Silo Save the World Overall A great game I would buy it if I were you 
Game for Kids or Adults I bought this game for my nephew and he loved it I haven t played it but my sister apparently has everytime I call her she s playing 
Works with Mac I actually bought this to use with my Intel Mac Mini because it was the cheapest usb mic I could find Wasn t 100 sure it would work but it does and for the price I d say it performs excellent 
Playstation 2 Microphone The product is very sturdy and very much more durable for smaller children than the headset microphone Purchased my daughter the headset microphone for Christmas and it was broken in a few days We purchased this one after and it has withstood quite well Great product 
It does the job No problems so far We ve only used the mic and another that is identical about 10 times now but no complaints so far My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2 It would be nice if there was a gain adjustment right on the mic but that may be a limitation of the PS2 or the game so I can t hold that against the mic without knowing more The cord is pretty long I d say 12 or so Whether or not it works on a PC or if a PC USB mic works on a PS2 I don t know Since I don t have any complaints you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 To me 4 stars means It does the job and has no major flaws 5 stars means This thing is awesome 
Get it If you are going to play Karaoke Revolution or any karoake type PlayStation 2 Game then you NEED this mike The headset bundled with the game is neither durable nor practical and as mentioned before it rarely fits everyone And it broke a few weeks after I bought the game This Logitech mic is much better and you can be a true karaoke star without worrying about getting too far for the cord it s 15 feet or knocking the headset off your head with your crazy moves I d say the only downside is that in Volume 4 when you do Sing and Dance you can get entangled in the cord if you re not careful But I just bought one for our KR game and I m about to get another so we can do duets 
Great Mic The mic was excellent The cord is long enough to give you plenty of room for movement The mic size is perfect because it can comfortable fit in any hand size including my 2 year old 
One of the best games I ever played I bought this game over four years ago and just have to say I must of replayed this game at least a dozen times Start Finish This game was one of the major reasons I bought an Xbox then an Xbox 360 If you like to play shooters this game is for you The graphics even by today s standards are very good The campaign is best thought out story I have ever seen even better than movies The only thing this game lacks is online play but this game was released just before Xbox Live came out If you want to play online get the PC version or buy Halo 2 Once you beat this game get Halo 2 it was also an extremely good game Halo 3 will be on sale for the Xbox 360 in a year hopefully less 
One hundred and ten percent This game is the latest in a series of universe changing and unbelievably addictive first person shooters First there was Wolfenstein I barely slept for weeks Then DooM and DooM II blew Wolfenstein completely out of the water Then Quake made you permanently renounce your allegiance to DooM Then Half Life made you say DooM DooM who And Halo will make you permanently forget all of those 
Innovative console game now looks dated This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available But today with doom and half life versions for xbox there is actually something to compare halo to and it doesn t stand up First off the plot is utterly pointless I never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief just frustrated when he died that I would have to replay a section The weapons are lame Released after the PC version of quake iii halo s weapons seem limp in comparison None of the futuristic aspects seem particularly believeable or useful for that matter The vehicles suck Driving the vehicles in Halo is as fun as operating a forklift which is actually quite entertaining in GTA san andreas so maybe it is not quite that fun I guess it is more like driving that super action wacky bike from the southpark chimpocoman episode 2 player story mode rules the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend multiplayer deathmatch is average Give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox but it wasn t as good as it s PC competition when it came out The much older quake III still looked and played better and now seems OK but no better than most That said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10 15 diversion just don t expect the immersive atmosphere of doom III or the intriguing plot twists of half life 
good RPG puzzle solving game I bought Contact based on positive hype without knowing much about it at all I m not disappointed Contact has proven to be a very enjoyable distraction for me ever since it came out The premise of the game is that you are helping a boy called Terry who is moored on a deserted island with a wacky professor You are communicating with the professor via your DS and guiding Terry s movements although he doesn t know you re there Terry s mission is to help the professor find his ship s fuel cells while solving mysteries and puzzles fighting bad guys and gaining skills In this sense the game is just like most RPGs but I believe that the level of gameplay is more sophisticated than your typical Final Fantasy or Zelda type venture Many elements of the game are borrowed from those successful series but they are also combined with puzzle game elements and even life simulation elements such as those of Harvest Moon Terry recharges energy by eating food he finds there are many different sorts sleeping in his bed or taking a warm bath He can fight enemies using weapons he picks up And he can find and interact with items and clues that help him complete his quest and go back home One of the cutest features is that he can acquire and change into outfits that enable him to use skills like cooking It s not difficult to get used to the intuitive game play especially after a brief read through the instructions You can be at home equally using the stylus or the console buttons What was interesting to me is that Terry can collect and stick on different decals that produce various effects and you even peel the decals off their backings like in real life although using the stylus Overall this is a very interesting kind of game and one that makes full use of the DS s unique capabilities such as dual screens If you re a fan of any of the genres mentioned above you won t be disappointed by Contact 
freedom to explore I love the way this game gives you the freedom to walk around everywhere You can have over 15 different weapons which makes the gameplay far more interesting than I d ever imagined You can change into different clothes which actually is important in helping you progress through the game It s not a normal style of gameplay but an interesting one to say the least While it s hardly the best game you can find on the market it s certainly unique 
Good little and fun product Well the list of games is below so I m not going to go through it Having a Commodore 64 128 as a child I played these games in their day I have a console collection so I loved video games since I was a child How many levels and full games you could fit in just 64K of memory and 350K disks back then Anyway this collection has some of the most beloved games of that era at least the ones they could license for use on it The Epyx games were some of the best of their time games like Impossible Mission are fun to solve and finish and they are not that easy to solve either Jumpman the International Karate and the Epyx games will test your reflexes and abilities to perform exact moves and joystick commands to get higher scores I have fun playing with this little piece of gaming history games are not only about flashy graphics though they make a difference but how much fun you get from a game When I was a kid I used to dream of the days I could see graphics on games like the ones we see today These units can be hacked if you wish to take flash drives with more games change the game list or even add joysticks and keyboards but that s something you will have to search for and know how to do A few programmers and technicians who worked with Commodore computers back then found out how to do this and even provide instructions on how perform these modifications if you re skillful enough I really like this product and is part of my collection now the games are not emulated as the C64 motherboard was reengineered and shrunk to the size of a small chip so you re playing the games with 100 reproduction accuracy I wish I could give it the whole five stars but I ll give it four because the joystick could be a bit more responsive or perhaps like a user mentioned it could be that I have the first version and perhaps this was addressed on the new version Overall a great fun product 
Ah the good old days Amazing how far computers have come since my old C64 was classified as a powerful machine graphically I love the new stuff but once in awhile its nice to backtrack to the good ol days of 64k memory and 5 1 4 disk drives I agree with the review about the difficulty of the games but its just once again a reminder of the changes in gaming with the times My old C64 eventually burnt up with use and its nice to see I m not the only one to miss these game treasures included on this wonderful piece of equipment Now if only somebody would do this with an apple II 
Good Collection of Commodore Games Even though my Commodore Joystick from Amazon didn t work I purchased it from other store and it s a good collection of Commodore 64 games for those who enjoy those 80 s days and nights waiting for the C 64 load games it will never be a complete collection because on C 64 we used to have hundred of them 5� Diskettes The graphics now looks rough comparing them to the current games however they did it with 64Kb only it s amazing how much they did with a little space 
A Commodore hackers dream The 30 in 1 sold thru Amazon is a real Commodore 64 computer on a single ship The NTSC Version 1 board has 128KB RAM and a 2MB ROM inside the case of the D2TV there are solder pads that will allow anyone who can solder to attach connectors for the IEC serial buss a PS2 keyboard and in some cases a second joystick and some of the wires for the user port product identification Version 1 comes in a pyramid shapped box has 128KB RAM 2MB ROM Version 2 comes in a hexagon shapped box has 2MB RAM 2MB flash Version 3 boards are in a game called Hummer of road racing 
Fan of the Xeno series You ll love it New to the game Very good game try it Simply put Xenogears + Xenosaga 1 is the absolute best storyline and best role playing experience on the PS2 to date I do strongly believe that Xenosaga 2 has the best storyline in any RPG I have ever ever played including Final Fantasy 7 Xenogears and hundreds of others Because RPGs are strongly reliant on storyline for gameplay I consider this to be the pinnacle of Role Playing on the PS2 Final Fantasy X comes close as does Star Ocean but in terms of storyline this game beats them However I did have to mark down for a few other minor flaws This game is highly a niche game only for those who enjoy the style and the sci fi setting It s also very short 20 hours if you play straight through no leveling up Maybe 38 42 hours if you take up the side quests and want a strong character Gameplay The first Xenosaga highly relied on cut scenes and narrative In fact I absolutely could not stand the battle system Xenosaga Episode 2 still relies heavily upon that storytelling through hours of cut scenes but it fixes the battle system The battle system is simply put one of the most fun turn based systems I have ever experienced While Xenosaga Episode 1 s battle system seemed slow and unwieldy Episode 2 has a fast paced action packed and highly challenging battle system You have 3 characters on the screen at just about all times these characters can be switched off in a manner much like FFX but it costs a turn in this game causing it to be more tactical Each turn you have many options you can attack more on various attacks later stock save a turn for the next turn in order to get a combo use ether read magic or change your battle party If you choose to attack there is a whole slew of options here as well Most importantly is learning the weak points of the enemy Every enemy including bosses have a certain attack combination that will be most effective against them When you attack you can press either square which is a B zone attack Triangle which is a C zone attack or circle which is another B zone attack Certain characters also have an A zone attack but this is only against flying opponents You must expierament with the enemies in order to learn the zones they are weakest in Sometimes you may be required to stock for a turn in order to attack the enemy in its weak zone What is the advantage of attacking weak zones you ask Well it allows for large scale damage pounding comboes that are absolutely essential in this game Once you have hit all of the enemy s weak zones you can do a break on them This involves the circle button Once a character is broken they can be tossed into the air or attacked while prone on the ground This can add up to tons of damage if you plan your boosting right Boosting is another integral part of the combat system Pressing the R1 button brings up a 3 slot meter which is sometimes empty but it may feature the character potraits of some of your characters If you press R1 and then the button square triangle or circle that that character s potrait is on they will boost forward and immediately after the acting unit has taken its turn this new character will have a turn Enemies however can take advantage of all of these systems as well If you do not plan well or randomly attack without comboes the enemy will break you boost ahead several times and can easily destroy one of your characters in one short brutal assault Countless times my entire party was destroyed by simple enemies that should have been no problem merely because I did not plan ahead You will get very very used to seeing the game over screen The plus side of this difficulty is that you feel real exhiliration when you win it is a great accomplishment Note that even with power levelling it won t help you much in some situations believe me I tried Finally there is Ether Ether skills are basically magic if you know anything about RPGs at all then you know basically what is present here healing ether skills attack ether skills nothing big I forgot to mention the E S units These are basically mechs and were called A G W S in Episode 1 Many points in the game involve you using these to move around and fight and now they have an independant battle system It s basically the same as the one with your characters on screen except that you only have one attack a turn no comboes or anything like that It is just an added piece of fun to an already awesome game There is a skill system in place After every battle you earn class pointss and or skill points These can be spent on getting new ether skills or new upgrades to your characters that can make them more resilient when you equip them Every character has the same skill set and this is a minor flaw that slightly brings down the gameplay score but not the overall enjoyment in the least Finally one other flaw with the gameplay is that there are no weapons and no armor Both of these are RPG standard fare and it seems kind of odd to not have either This may just be something the developers decided not to do that I disagree with but it still seems a little odd Note that this really does not detract from the game in any way In Xenosaga 2 they also opted to add a lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 had The interesting thing is that these puzzles while challenging don t take away from the gameplay expierience at all In fact I found many to be very enjoyable The storyline of this game is simply incredible But keep in mind that it is basically required that you have beaten Xenosaga episode 1 if you want to understand it at all or at least be acquainted with the story in some manner If you haven t played it the best way is to get the bonus DVD that came with the game there are probably some somewhere around maybe even on ebay that allows you to see 4 hours of cut scenes from the original This can substitute in for those who dont want to spend the 60 80 hours required on Xenosaga episode 1 to beat it Anyway I digress Xenosaga 2 s storyline is more of the space opera fun Often times I got very emotional and the game can tug on your heartstrings In the ending sequence of the game a spectacular event lasting about 15 minutes I was seriously in tears This game can do that to you the storyline is that good It is also filled with entrigue betrayal new discoveries and new secrets It is truly incredible I have seen certain reviews that say the storyline doesn t solve everything it doesn t solve all the mysteries Let me tell you something it s not supposed to Xenosaga is going to be a 4 8 part series and the storyline is continuous It makes no sense at all to have the story be complete in only episode II I see no reason why anyone could possibly complain about it Graphics The graphics of Xenosaga 2 are basically the same as they were in episode 1 No real improvements at all They are still great though and the cut scenes are gorgeous My one real complaint here is that the lip sync is sometimes off a problem with just about every RPG with voice overs and some of the environments are a little dull This is made up for in the environments that are simply breathtaking Sound The soundtrack of Xenosaga Episode 2 is godlike From the opening theme to the battle music to the catchy Japanese sounding tunes that ring in your head forever this music is INCREDIBLE The voice acting is also absolutely superb I have zero complaints this is a rarity Sound effects are also very appropriate and very well done Value The game is hurt in the value department only because of its length To put it in perspective the first playthrough took me about 28 hours but more like 30 if you count all the times I died and had to go back to the point I got killed at After you win you can use your game clear file to access even more goodies like some bonus bosses dungeons and side quests and this helps make up for the shorter length Personally I think its the best 50 I have ever spent Tilt Finally the overall enjoyment This game is simply the most enjoyable game I have played on the PS2 I completed it after several all night gaming sessions and it will most likely keep you up too The Role Playing experience here is superb the storyline is possibly the best in RPG history and the battle system is incredible and in depth There is virtually nothing not to like As an avid RPG gamer I recommend this game as highly as is possible However there are a few things to consider can you handle the challenge and do you like the Space Opera Anime feel If you answered yes to both get this game 
Not as excellent as Xenosaga I but still good Xenosaga II Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga which was released here But we European players never played Xenosaga I before so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great Special Box In this box was the game itself and a Movie DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies Back to topic in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job with his elevator music o The graphics are okay but I couldn t see anything outstanding In the end I must say that Xenosaga II is a good RPG even if it s not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga That s the reason why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_ But at last the most PAL players are happy that actually my dictionary doesn t give me the right English translation for ueberhaupt _ sorry Xenosaga II come to Europe yet So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope that this Episode will be like the first Many greets from Germany Viele Grue e aus Deutschland ^ 
My two cents As I read the previous reviews and other reviews about this games I had to agree with some and disagree with others I like the whole story line of the game It gave us insight into the history of Jr and Gaignun and Shion I was very disappointed with the overall combat system I liked changing characters in the middle combat like in FF X but I miss the ability to hit the enemies with special weapons like in the first episode I was also disappointed with the way the creators changed the way to build the characters from the first episode to the second I liked having characters with different abilities It added diversity to building a strong team I didn t care too much for the Good samaritan side quests I didn t like having to go all over the place to pick up stuff vital to the development of my characters or to advance the game The ability to have two characters attack during combat using special attacks was interesting even though I didn t use it much As far as the characters themselves I agree with another reviewer about Shion I also found her to be bossy and cold In certain scenes I found her to be too emotional Most of her lines near the end were completely out of place especially at the end after Jr s showdown with Albedo I was disappointed when my most favorite NPC Gaignun was possessed but that s just me I agree with one reviewer about the voice for MOMO although I did like some of her lines I was very happy the creator took away her wand and give her weapon It made her very useful in combat chaos was too laid back for me in this game and KOS MOS was too much on the vain side I did like how the reaction between Shion and Jin or KOS MOS before combat starts Overall the game was enjoyable to play Once I got pass the disappointing aspects of the game I found it to very entertaining 
SMALL AMMOUNT OF QUESTIONS THIS GAME LACKS QUESTIONS AND REPEATS THEM OVER AND OVER 200 QUESTIONS MORE LIKE 40 BUT REGIS IS HILARIOUS BUT THE FASTEST FINGER IS WAY OFF I HAVE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS EXCEPT THE LACK OF QUESTIONS AND THE FF ROUND 
Short Lasting Realistic and Drawn Out This game matches with the real thing quite well but has too few questions to endure If you ve never seen the show it s simply a series of fifteen each increasing in dollar amount until the last million dollar question It s drawn out There s a speech clip for each dollar amount answer and other things The infamous quot final answer quot option only appears when you take a while to answer unfortunately The lifelines are realistic minus the fact that quot phone a friend quot is really quot phone Regis s friend quot The quot fast finger quot scrambles the choices and the first correct key pressed wins The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people but only those who won t run out of questions 
ummmmmmmmm Hunny you still playing I bought this for my husband um yep he s still at it He never touched and video game until I got him GT2 then 3 came out and he showed a little more interest Now 4 well lets just say He is on it when ever he gets time Cars lots of cars Tracts that will challege even the toughest driver So much to offer in a little CD package The image quality is so realistic that at times you have to make yourself remember that they are not real The places you can see and the roads you can travel wow is all i can think of knowing it hardly touches the beauty you will we see And going by how often I hear my hubby yell at the other drivers on the field shows me just how it draws you into its reality Well worth the price I think wonder if its my turn to play now 
Excellent Game Excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales Es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar 
What did you expect Its Gran Turismo theres really nothing more to say I own all the titles in this franchise and I have never been disappointed with any one of em The series is really amazing With every new release it only gets better People should also try Tourist Trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing 
AMAZING THIS IS THE MOST COMPLETE AND MOST INTERESTING RACING GAME EVER DEVELOPED IN THE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES THE BEST GRAPHICS THE MOST CARS THE PRECISE HANDLING AND DID I MENTION THE GRAPHICS WOW THIS IS AMAZING PLAYING THIS GAME MAKES ME WONDER WHAT WOULD THE NEXT ONE WILL LOOK LIKE HOW CAN SONY MAKE ANYTHING THAT S BETTER THAN THIS IT IS ALREADY THE BEST RACING GAME IN THE WORLD IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING NO OTHER GAME COULD EVER COME CLOSE GRAN TURISMO HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMMITATED BUT NEVER DUPLICATED A FIVE OUT OF FIVE 
Xbox Forget about the brick I could care less what it does for the original Xbox what I m into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer Xbox save files over to Xbox 360 Now I won t have to start Halo all over 
OMG THIS PWNS 1337 UBER HAXXORZ in halo 2 if you make jump videos like me or like to make movies overall in halo 2 you can make the game hudless HUDLESS so you don t have to do the oddball trick any more and can keep jumping and filming with a clean result I hate cheaters and wish all of them could just be blown off of the face of the earth but making my games hudless is the the whole reason i m buying 
YOU DONT KNOW THE POWER As i read in other reveiws everybody here thinks this is a cheating program like gameshark But if you knew the true understand and wasn t an idiot who doesn t understand what PC stands for Action Replay lets you modify games and replay them on your xbox which now has come to be know as Soft Modding By downloading a special program just made for this xbox you are able to harness the power of modifying saves and even then create weapons maps and games into your xbox Which has come very handy in halo for me since I can now create maps into what i want allowing veihcles into maps where they cant be This is not a hundered percent chance of it working though if you have to many games saved on the xbox since its a large file when downloaded on for more information just type in Soft Modding and a ton of sites will come up 
More Game Functionality The Jedi additions are outstanding Better game feel and play but the flying can be challenging Not sure if I am not yet used to it but it is taking some time getting used to it to be able to fly and understand how to avoid death 
average game madden comes out again but with some stupid lead blocking controls i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls y cant they come out with something good 
Mostly unchanged from the previous year still a solid showing If you ve played one Madden game you ve played them all for the most part at least Madden 07 is almost a carbon copy of Madden 06 This incarnation contains all the essentials Franchise mode all of the NFL teams including all AFC all NFC and NFL europe and historical teams Create your own player fan or team then play single games or entire seasons All the usual Mini Games and Madden Cards are back as well as Online play for those who have the network add on for the PS2 NFL Superstar returns from 06 giving you the opportunity to create a player from a set of random genes or parents which give a wide array of player attributes determining how good your player is and what position he starts at You can also opt to load NCAA 07 Heisman players to continue their illustrious career in the NFL Within superstar you control only your player when he is on the field with the option of controlling or not controlling your team when he is not on the field After several seasons hopefully you ve gained enough statistics and cred to make it into the hall of fame Both franchise and Superstar modes allow for the use of different roles each player can aquire by meeting a certain criteria these roles increase the attributes of your player and other players on your team or decrease the stats of players on the opposing team Some of these stats can be negetive too however such as distracting players or under achievers The control scheme hasn t changed in years The truck stick is now the highlight stick and works pretty much the same way The QB Vision cone is back but this time optional for better or worse The hit stick on defense is less picky this year as moving the stick in any direction will attempt a big hit as opposed to hit sticking in the direction of the ball carrier as in previous games of course your chance for a clean hit is less than your standard diving tackle and the AI seems better at juking this year Playmaker controls and Lead Blocking controls are hangin strong and are extremely useful practically essential on the harder difficulties Before snap audible control has far more depth than previous games allowing audibles in formation plays or just individual routes Playing defense is also a little harder relying on the AI to play as your Defensive Backs will let up 3 4 big plays for TD s every game and on the harder difficulties the AI is just as useless stopping the run I gave this game a 3 because of the apparent lack of effort on EA s part to deliver a reliable product This game lags freezes on some loading screens and is buggy in all sorts of ways The graphics even seem a little choppier Credit this to all the work being done for the 360 and PS3 versions of the game both of wich are leaps and bounds ahead of this generation of madden games In one game I had played at the end of the third quarter with 1 second remaining and ticking away I snapped the ball only to have the ref blow his whistle The game froze for a second the ball was then snapped with 0 00 on the clock and I was allowed to continue playing normally however the 4th quarter never started The game would go on for eternity with 0 00 left in the 3rd quarter Overall it s the same package you come to expect from EA and Madden and probably one of the last we ll see on the current generation of consles which is a good thing in my eyes considering the lack of attention attributed to this game in favor of the new ones The customer should always get what they pay for and at standard retail price EA delivers a game which feels neglected but is still Madden at its core and contains enough of what matters to not collect any dust until 08 
PS2 Madden 2007 I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see However my major disappointment comes from the graphics I understand the ps2 doesn t not have the standards of the XBox360 but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for I just hope when the ps3 comes out Madden will rerelease the game for it to give the XBox360 owners something to whine about EA should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have 
Works fine on XP This is an enjoyable game educational as well For the price it s worth buying The puzzles aren t difficult but challenging enough to keep it interesting The game reminded me of an easier version of Myst You don t need to have prior knowledge of physics a handy reference guide is available as part of the gameplay The only drawback was that the screen was small Maybe that could have been fixed but I didn t want to mess with the setup since some games can be finicky on XP 
Final Fantasy IX Review I am a big fan of RPGs and this is one of my favorite one yet It has a great story line and it is not impossible to beat 
Amazing I just got this game on thursday and I m already on disc 2 This is my first time ever playing a Final Fantasy game and I m glad I picked number 9 I won t spoil anything by telling any of the story but I will tell you the game is amazing The graphics are great and there the best I ve ever seen for a PS1 game I love characters I d have to say that Vivi is my favorite and then next would be Zidane but really I love them all Playing Final Fantasy 9 has made me wanna buy the other games and play them too Buy this game you won t regret it 
The FINAL Final Fantasy for the PSone This is probably one of my least favorite FF games on the PSone There are some good things and some bad things about this game first the bad 1 Squaresoft Now Square Enix Goddammit was trying to get to the old roots of the SNES games To me anyway it doesn t look entirely like those games 2 Some of the characters are the worst in the FF games history Quina Eiko and Garnet I am not sexist it s just that their abilities suck and their type of combat is terrible the other characters are good not great but decent 3 I don t care too much for the character models the deformation and Final Fantasy 8 graphics mix okay for the good parts of the game 1 The Cinemas they look really good for a PSone game most of the games cinemas on the PSone don t look that great in this era of gaming and even some during that era 2 Ending I am not saying anymore 3 The battle system it s not quite FF8 and not quite FF7 but it s in between and has the Trance system thingy After this game I sadly am seeing the series not being as good as it once was I like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals and can t wait for the remake of FF3 for the DS Final Fantasy 10 isn t that legendary FF 11 which I never did and never will play because of fees reminds me too much like Phantasy Star Online I like that game though and not much of a single player expericence with no storyline and FF 12 just because it will have the FF11 battle engine looks like FFCC and FF10 mixed together and I just seem not to care that much about the newer FF games anymore So I would recommend any FF game on the PSone Including the PSone ports of the SNES games and Origins because they are so great and even if the games don t have the best graphics in the world it s gameplay and storylines that count 
Not Square s Best But Better Than Most I LOVE Final Fantasy games They are the reason that I still have my NES and SNES This really does take me back to the early days of Square Admittedly I ve gotten older and my tastes have changed in the past 15 years I think its been that long since FF1 was released but this game just makes me smile Completing the Chocobo Side Quests making sure mognet gets back online defeating Hades and Ozma power leveling like a mad man laughing at Zidane for being as bad with the ladies as I am All in all the important parts of the game are what kept me playing Now I will say there are a few annoying parts You should never sell any equipment The Synth shop is a wonderful idea but for some items at the end of the game you need weapons that you got at the beginning of Disc 1 Also some weapons disappear from the face of the planet as you switch discs That little fact causes quite an annoying problem for those of us who like to see every ability fully mastered for every character if you cant tell I was the kid that spent 3 months in the downed Shin ra plane getting everyone to 255 stat points Overall this is an outstanding game It keeps me wanting to play it makes my chronic insomnia relapse and I love just watching Vivi dance during fights and watching Zidane get shot down over and over in the interim The Graphics of this game are simply beautiful Its not something that will ooooo and ahhhh you but if you give them a second look after you get over the cartoon like feel you ll notice that they someone took their time with this production Someone made sure every single detail was perfect FFVII felt 2D and while you knew the scenery was a 3D endeavor it felt like a 2D isometric drawing rather than a fully 3D rendered scene When you look at FFIX you KNOW you are looking at a fully 3D environment It was a really great thing to see especially on the PSX even though the XBOX 360 is now out Characters what can i say about the characters I love them They all make me smile I relate completely with Zidane s social life and then his story took me off guard the first time i heard it I wasn t expecting it and it made me want to play longer Garnet is interesting She is that naive girl we all knew in high school It just seems every character has their own story and it is pretty well explored really what do you know about Yuffie Zell Quistis and Irvine Do you ever wonder how Reeve controlled Cait Sith while he was talking to Scarlet and Heidegger I really do not have a lot of unanswered questions like that with FFIX just some things that could have been elaborated on like the summoner s village but all in all i think the story was pretty perfect My only BIG complaint and is the length of the game There is a lot of stuff to do but the end of the game can be reached in UNDER 12 hours 4 months of work to get a certain sword stay with Ragnarok if you are reading this saying I got Excalibur II is not worth the heartache This game gets 4 stars because while it is a good game I just wish there was more of it There s plenty of side quest stuff just not enough story time 12 hours of story is just about as long as Aeris stays breathing in FF7 Hope this makes your purchasing decision a little easier Its definitely a great game and heck if worse comes to worse it s a good time killer for a rainy weekend 
Great Games I also am a huge monkey ball fan and also own them all and this one is just as good as not better than the others game play is awsome with the new control system and as for the old target game their are a few target games on this one if you dont like monkey target then try paraglider for a much harder and funner game This games has so many games that are fun with friends of all ages snowboarding a few racing disk golf free throw hovercraft battle boxer bowling fencing sling shot and so many more 
no boys allowed Don t let the screen name fool you I m actually a guy But getting that out of the way I m really into music and I have an Eyetoy so I got Groove It s atmosphere is extremely feminine but this is a great game There are only 23 songs to begin with and a grand total of 5 to unlock Yippie However girls this is a very good party game and guys try it out You ll feel like a pussy but you ll have fun doing it Overall this is a great rythm game but it s in the minor leagues when compared to its awesome competitors like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero 
Fun But Needs More Songs Fun game You can actually dance to play once you master the game The only thing I think it needs are more fast dance songs and more innovative dance moves although you can create your own dance chart Otherwise a fun time and the price is right Enjoy 
This game roxs my sox I bought this game a couple months ago and I absolutely love it I am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will LOVE ths it s great excerise and very challenging with cool music It s like DDR only with your hands Try it I promise you ll have a great time I could play it all day 
Fun and challenging My daughter got the Eye Toy for her birthday and we recently added the Dance Groove game to the collection She and her friends 10 yrs of age really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids She says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera 
Have You Hugged a Prinny Today Admittedly I haven t played a lot of strategy RPGs I attempted to play Final Fantasy Tactics generally considered to be a classic of the genre at one point but I found it really dry and I had serious problems with a class system that seems to really unbalance the game by making it too easy I ve never really had much motivation to seek out other examples of SRPG genre because there is Nippon Ichi s Disgaea series as unique as it is fun And long lasting too You can spend several hundred hours playing through Disgaea Hour of Darkness and Disgaea 2 Cursed Memories to beat all the bonus content beyond the main campaign Disgaea 2 shines as being a more polished version of the first Disgaea Character sprites are more vivid spell effects have more visual flare The music and dialogue has a sharper audio quality All the bonus quests from the first Disgaea have been expanded on such as the inclusion of the Dark Court in the endless dungeon of the Item World and even more stuff to do in the Dark Assembly However it is also so similar to the first game that it feels almost like an expansion pack rather than true sequel The story of Disgaea 2 is similar to first one in that it is highly character driven and told with quite a bit of humor Overlord Zenon has tranformed all the residents of the world of Veldime into monsters Adell the last remaining human embacks on a quest to slay the Overlord with Rozalin Zenon s haughty and neglected daughter Along the way they meet a colorful cast of enemies rivals and allies as they attempt to crack the mystery behind the near immortal Zenon It s an enjoyable story if a bit meandering It s one major susprise is a twist at the end that caught me off guard though it probably shouldn t have Combat like most SRPGs takes place on a series of grid like maps usually four to a chapter Characters can move around so many squares per turn and have the opportunity to attack any enemies that falls within their attack range The battlefields are littered with Geo panels multicolored pyramids that confer penalties and bonuses to certain areas of the maps There are dozens of classes both monster and human to fashion a powerful army out of Choose wisely because a grand total of 10 can be deployed at any one time Unfortunately experience points only go to the character that deals the final blow so level disparities between characters combined with a steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary to replay some of maps at times Luckily the difficulty curve is much more finely tuned in this game so you will spend less time leveling up than in the first game The main campaign in Disgaea 2 is pretty short I clocked in a little over 30 hours in my first play through granted I barely touched much of the sidequests I also found it to be a little on the easy side I didn t die once until I was on the penultimate chapter I don t know it that is because the game is easier or if it s just from spending over one hundred hours conquering the first game SPRGs are probably the hardest sub set out of the RPG genre The Disgaea series is highly recommended for experienced and inexperienced players alike Disgaea 2 has many different systems that enhance the playing experience but unlike many games doesn t force the player to learn how to work them all Players have the option of playing the game at face value or learning all the complex systems for a more enriched experience This is a very accessable game and this is a genre that definitely needs more games that strike a balance between being too hard or too easy 
Awesome I bought Disgaea when it first came out and thought it was great Fun funny and with many long hours of game play When 2 came out I was excited It didnt let me down Many features were improved from the first game The assembly is much more wieldy now The item world is more controlled And the battle are more challenging They also removed the ridiculous overpowered character aka angels and majiin that took forever to unlock and only obssesed players get em 
You ll Have Fond Memories of this Game Three years ago Disgaea hit the scene and was by far one of the best games to grace the Playstation 2 Now we have Disgaea 2 Disgaea 2 follows the If it ain t broke don t fix it path While Disgaea 2 is really familiar to the first one that s not a bad thing the first one was absolutely perfect Disgaea 2 does connect with the first one So this really is a sequel It isn t however a sequel that requires knowledge of the events in the first game You may very well run into familiar characters but on the whole Disgaea 2 is a whole new story Adell is the only human in a town full of monsters and it s all the overlord Zenon s fault He s put a curse on the town to make them all lose their memories When Adell s mom decides to perform a ritual that will bring forth the Overlord she instead brings forth Zenon s daughter Rozalin So you ll now have to venture off in search of the overlord The best thing about Disgaea 2 s storyline is the same thing that worked well with the first one It has a perfect balance between it s moments of seriousness and humor It s a well crafted story that isn t afraid to break the rules The game really plays no different from the first one You ll go into battle and be able to do a bunch of different things While it does play like your basic tactical RPG it throws in some things that make it more worthwhile Like the geopanels on the ground that if a character stands on they get special enhancements You can also do things like have one character stand on another s shoulders If you don t like the effects though you can just destroy the power source It s not as easy as it was in the first one however These power sources now get up and walk around The game is also rather complex Battling is no walk in the park If you re familiar with tactical strategy games then Disgaea 2 will be easy to learn You ll deploy ten of your characters on battle at a time They can perform team attacks or attack indivually You can use this to your advantage but your enemies also must be kept in mind They don t slouch They ll attack at the same time and can take your characters down pretty fast if you don t know what you re doing Of course Disgaea 2 also sports some rather bizarre moments in battle just like it s prequel For one thing you can order a pizza in the middle of battle This is just one of many different things you can do Items also level up and your characters levels will soar It won t take you that long to complete the main storyline but purists will find that Disgaea 2 much like the first one is almost never ending in terms of complete mastery Your characters levels will rise far into the hundreds and even thousands It s almost never ending You can also replay story missions over and over and go into optional dungeons Items also level up You can go into the item world and level up your items You can level up just about any item Your weapons armor even that pizza you ordered These moments of the game also feel never ending at times Disgaea 2 pretty much looks and feels like the first one It s simply a beautiful game It s got spectacular artwork It s 2D artwork but it s some of the most beautiful in the gaming world It also sounds really good keeping the theme of the first game in tact The voice acting is probably the best part They re so lively and vibrant and the dialogue is crafty and filled to the brim with humor Some of the humor mind you is probably not suitable for your little kid There some sexual and dirty jokes but they re really funny Disgaea 2 is just an all out blast The game for one thing is huge It may only take 40 hours or so to complete the main quest but to master the game That ll take much longer than just about any tactical RPG out there There s so much to be done and it s by far one of the most addicting games out there So if you do like tactical strategy RPGs then by all means play this game You ll love it If you loved the first Disgaea you will love this game There s no doubt about it The Good +Loveable characters +Fantastic storyline +Addictive gameplay +This game is huge +Beautiful artwork +Complex battle system +Vibrant and colorful voice acting among the best in gaming The Bad The only real bad thing about this game if you can even say it s bad is that it doesn t really go above and beyond the first Disgaea In other words there s not a whole lot of new content or anything like that However it s still a bit more original than most other tactical RPGs out ther 
Great fun casual RPG with humor Disgaea 2 is a fun cartoony combination of RPG and tactical game You are Adell a young fighter who pairs up with Rozalin in order to defeat the evil Zenon You build up a party of characters including fighters healers and pretty much any monster type you defeat in battle As you wander through the lands you often find monsters to conquer During these battles you end up on a grid Each character can move a certain distance per turn to get around and behind your enemy In some ways the game is like a typical RPG There is an evil main boss to conquer There are various smaller enemies along the way There are power ups to collect and weapons to buy The graphics are not meant to be realistic or cutting edge They are casual cute and fun Disgaea really shines in its humor It s not meant for the really little its characters joke about looking up girls skirts and there are swears such as kick their ass Still the game is generally very family friendly and has a ton of fun in it Most of the villagers have been turned into demons and have quite wild personality changes The main character Adell is still human When you go around talking to the other people one muses why Adell is still human Is it because he s the main character Rozalin Zenon s daughter is a very spoiled stuck up teen girl and her dialogue is quite funny Many flaws of other games have been taken care of here When you go into shops they have new items each time giving you a selection to choose from that you will find interesting You can customize new characters creating a party that is just perfect for your gaming style The voices are cutesy in the traditional anime style and the sounds fit in well with the world The plot is fairly involved and really draws you along Again this isn t a dark serious story of angst and power It s a fun light hearted romp through a fun fantasy world where you can play for a few hours save and pick up the story the next time you have free time Well recommended 
About time After playing Disgaea 1 I tried in vain to satisfy my srpg thirst with every game nipponicchi released afterwards La Pucelle Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom alas not a one compared to the greatness that was Disgaea But it is safe to say that Disgaea 2 is not only as good as Digaea 1 but better The graphics in this one are better the music takes you back to the good old days when rpg music was memorable There have been a few needed tweaks to the battle system here and there However there have also been some additions to Disgaea 2 that some people may or may not like such as the Item World pirates incredibly strong characters that show up randomly in the item world to make life miserable for any unfortunate to cross their path The main characters do not seem as lovable as Laharl Etna and the rest of the Disgaea 1 crew but I guess they ll grow on you after the 200+ or so hours your likely to be spending with them Speaking of which I gotta get back now those very same item pirates have just killed Adell 
Fun Improved great for strategy fans Granted Disgaea 2 won t do much for fans of the Fighting FPS or Action genres but for those who love anime and strategy will have a bundle of fun The battle system is on the outside the same as Disgaea s but there are some interesting and important improvements Here are a few One there is a lift+attack move lifting a character and then attacking like in Makai Kingdoms Two A character who was assigned to attack but was unable to because the target they were going to attack was eliminated by another character before they could attack no longer loses their move Instead they get to move again instead Three guns operate in a significantly different way than bows a problem with Disgaea 1 giving them a great utility Four Speed down Def down and other effects occur more often as a result of weapon usage and are easier to see Five Treasure chests are now a part of battle Six The item bag I m pretty sure is larger Seven Additional battle items are available one of them being cellular phones You ll have to find out what they do Eight Team attacks have become more ridiculous This is a good thing Nine Battle maps are much improved and more interesting The game now has a really spiffy intro hi res and maintains the same irreverent humor of the previous games The quality however is on par with actually better than Disgaea Hour of Darkness Voice acting manages to not be annoying in many cases its very good And it is refreshing to play a good guy again Laharl is obviously in the game he is seen in the character collage art and there are numerous references from La Pucelle Tactics Disgaea Hour of Darkness Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdoms The manual lacks clarity in some places and a lot of the graphics are still very pixely Overall though its hard to beat this game for fun But be warned it takes a LONG time to play 
A preliminary review Having picked up the game only today perhaps I shouldn t review it JUST yet since I ve only played it for a couple of hours But initial response is d mn good The fact is Disgaea 2 seems to improve in all ways on its predecessor The story seems quite deep I ll spoil none of what I ve discovered although you can pretty much find it all out by reading around The graphics are better but still not up to snuff it s the reason I dropped the game a star There is an incredible number of extras to the game and the voices are much better at least in my opinion No there is no Laharl as the main character although I haven t given up on seeing him or the main character of Phantom Brave in the almost assuredly present end dungeons but this game at least early on is pretty good nonetheless I ll try to uhhh review my review as I play more but initial observations point to many more hours wasted on this series Addendum Now having completed the main game and embarked on the subplots I can confidently say that this game trumps the last Disgaea and that is about the highest praise I can give it This is an INCREDIBLE game with layers of strategy and plenty of power levelling if you so desire I only wish I could change from 4 to 5 stars overall You cannot go wrong with this one if only for the optional dungeons alone which include the Dark Worlds the Land of Carnage a trip to Laharl a date with Mid Boss and even an opening extra Nippon Ichi my hat is off to you You have made one of the best games ever 
THE FFVII UNIVERSE RETURNS WITH A VENGEANCE I honestly don t know why everybody is so negative regarding this game I think it s phenominal Great missions great story and game play and the variety in the weapon customization feature makes for fun little side quests Overall it s a great addition to the FFVII universe and I definitely hope to see more games with these characters coming out soon Even a remake of the original FFVII would be grand On the whole Vincent Valentine is one bad dude The bosses are interesting and cool and the links to the original game are awesome If you re a fan buy this game If you re not a fan and want to have an interesting gaming experience the please consider this title The Timewarrior has spoken 
A Different Perspective on the Final Fantasy Franchise The game was quite fun to play though it has little to really offer in the way of replay value Unless you are a fan of both the Final Fantasy series of games and their elaborate storylines as well as a fan of FPS First Person Shooter types of a games I would probably warn you that this particular offering may not be your cup of tea It is nice to get a bit more of the backstory and continuation of the Final Fantasy VII game one of best overall in the series but the gameplay does sometime get a bit two dimensional and stale All in all it was a short but exciting romp through a familiar world it could have been more but it was okay for what it was 
Not quite what I d hoped for but I m an avid Final Fantasy FF fan When I found out they were making a game devoted to my favorite male character Vincent Valentine I was stoked After pre ordering this game and waiting FOREVER to get it I was expecting the usual action packed fighting and detailed storyline that can be seen in almost all FF games Sadly though I was to be a little disappointed Dirge of Cerberus is a first person shooter just you armed enemies and a lotta guns based on the Final Fantasy VII character Vincent The gameplay s pretty decent with a multitude of different enemies and fast paced gameplay at times The graphics however are a biiiiiiig let down after the initial FMV sequence The guns are pretty basic as far as usage but the equiptment system can be confusing and the materia system is just plain weird at first I m not even going to start on the item limits The game isn t overly difficult or overly easy and offers a few different modes of gameplay easy hard for the unexperienced and veteran players The voice acting is pretty decent and I personally thought the voices matched most characters well Now on to the story Any FF fan should know how much of a let down these last few FF VII sequels have been movie and games They re not bad in the sense of game development or outward beauty but in the sense of storyline Dirge of Cerberus takes the story on a complete tangent Lucrecia and Vincent s past is given in a series of cut scenes and chance encounters while new completely out of the blue characters come to make difficult the process of finding out Vincent s dark history Though it has the casual flare of any FF storyline it more so resembles the two FF movies in its science fiction wannabe horror elements Old characters are brought back new frustrations are raised with hinted love interests and nothing can ever seem to go right on the planet once again Overall this game isn t bad It isn t great but it isn t bad Avid very avid fans of the series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened though they should watch carefully for the things that didn t match the first game If you re a player new to the series play FF VII first or you won t get the full impact of the game If you don t really care and are just checking this out for the heck of it don t buy it Your money is better spent on a good first person shooter like Metal Gear Solid 
Not much new here but great gameplay I originally put off playing this game because I feared that it would ruin the integrity of FFVII for me i also had heard many bad reviews from all over the place about it However i found it was a very fun game At first i had a few gripes about the camera and the voices It s clumsy unfocused and generally all over the place an some of the voices are just wrong but luckily Vincent s is okay However the story was engaging enough that I adjusted to the camera after a while While it s pretty much like every other shooter you shoot things run around get items and shoot things some more it has some familliar and interesting things that sets it aside First it fills in some things about Vincents story in FFVII that people may recall Then there are the familliar settings One of these settings which completely freaked me out is a burned out version of the shinra building Another good thing is the use of materia It can be equipped with weapons and used And then there are the returning characters which it is always an enjoyment to see The gameplay is fast and chaotic but in a fun way And there s even a special boss at the end Overall a pretty fun game 
Fun game just a really bad game I read poor reviews for this game in PSM magazine yet failed to believe them seeing I am a hardcore Final Fantasy fan I ran to the store and picked this up popped it in my PS2 and awaited to review it myself I seem to speak for myself when saying this but I just think simple games that are easy are just fun This game was amazingly fun just not worth 50 I highly suggest renting this game unless you re a FF collecter like myself The length is also dissapointing seeing I beat it in one sitting only about a 4 6 hour game Ok now for the more technical review There are only three guns the majority of the entire game is spent watching cut scenes rather than playing I m not exagerrating Dungeon design is poor and predictable pretty much just walk forward the action consists of repeatedly pressing one single button no fancy combos even though they tease you by showing Vincent pull them off in cut scenes there is a jump command by pressing X in yet only few things can actually be jumped over or upon lacks story etc however the music is pretty good even without Uematsu the CG is great Advent Children quality and the characterization of Vincent is a plus If you re looking for a good game don t play this if you re looking for a fun meaning easy and simple game or a variation on the Final Fantasy we all know and love then I suggest RENTING this Unless of course as I ve said before you simply want to buy it for its title or to add to your FF collection 
GREAT I bought 2 of these controllers for my kids because I didn t want cables in the middle of our Family Room nor did I want them sitting too close to the TV when they played This controllers are excellent They work perfectly they are easy to store because of the lack of cables the weight is fine for small children the range of the signal is more than enough and they aren t battery eaters I use them as well and they are wonderful They are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations 
A Ruler and I got the earlier design of this controller It was bigger and felt better than the regular dual shock The only down side to it was the analog sticks The top curves in like a bowl and not like a knob and has no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off This new controller does away with that problem and goes back to the old knob style analog sticks with more grip BUT it s the size of a regular controller now but rounded It does fit well in the hand and uses only 2 AA batteries This controller is great but if and when it does stop working like the other reviewers say I will swap out the analog sticks to my old logitech controllers a little altering needed 
The best game ever It has buttons and no cord I can press the buttons with my thumbs The sticks go round and round and round and round 
PS2 Cordless Controller My son loves this controller It fits well in his hands and has a similar feel to the regular corded PS2 Sony controller It doesn t have the same rumble feature but has a button to turn the rumble feature on and off Overall it s the best cordless that he s used yet 
Fast and great the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin 
Innovative gameplay and music that sticks in your brain Two ingredients for a classic game Much like Katamari Damacy this game makes you play in a new way As opposed to games that really require additional fingers to play properly this one uses only three buttons the L and R shoulder buttons and the O With the shoulders you tilt the world so you can roll back and forth along the brightly colored landscape and with the O you spilt into little blobs and join back up again The levels are works of art each one unique It s a shame there s no hint book for the game poster size copies of each level would be a delight to see In Japan they actually posted the entire first level as a mural sized ad in subways The obstacles are as cute as they come not since the Mega Man series have villains been so cute and infuriating And the music oh god the music All gibberish so they didn t have to be translated and all adorable you ll be humming them for days This little diversion will dominate your life The replay value is infinite you ll spend days trying to get that last berry Mui Mui 
A lot better than The Duke When ever I go to LAN Parties everyone there prefers this controller Theres only one person who used the bulky original Duke controller When he does it often dissconnects on him for no reason The S controller is a lot better in my perspective Its what I ve always used and what the majority of the population uses They should just call it the Xbox Controller without the S suffix 
the s controller the s controller is a auesome buy i have three and my big controller is horrible i let my dad use it and i always win but when he uses the s controller he wins so if u want to buy a controller the s controller is the very one to buy and if u only have two or one buy two or three 
Sleek Although I don t own my own Xbox I always play someone else s because I already own a PS2 I never the less feel obligated to add my thoughts on the matter The new Xbox controller S is one sleek piece of equipment FAR superior to that original monstrousity of a controller those idiots at Microsoft initially came up with it was that super ugly gigantic and clunky original controller that turned me off from buying the Xbox when it came out The new controller S is visually appealing to the eyes Although the PS2 controller is still slightly more attractive the controller S is an extremely close second The controller s is smaller and handier than the original has easier to use controls and is VERY comfortable to grip Just compare the different controllers of Xbox PS2 and Gamecube by holding them in your hands and fiddling around with the controls You will see that the Xbox controller S has the nicest fit of them all on the palms of your hands the Gamecube is the least comfortable Ironically the controller S was originally designed for the Xbox release in Japan because the original controller was deemed too big for Japanese players I really think those folks at Microsoft should plan things a little better before jumping in to the game 
HEE HEE Needs more shoulder buttons Other than that is good 
WOW I loved Xenogears and when it was known that they were going to bring out xenosaga I was so looking forward to it Well 1 didn t disapoint which led to 2 Then there was 2 well talk about a letdown Then the talk of 3 started At first I was unsure if I wanted to lay down any more money and be disapointed yet again But WOW am I glad I did It was a beauty to watch and play Many of the answers from games 1 and 2 can be found it breath taking cut scenes Im not going to spoil things for you but just to say WOW isnt enough to discribe the CGI s and twist and turns I just hope you enjoy this game as much as I have 
The most beautiful game on the market The game has a LOT of plot development and cutscenes If you are into it then that s great I find I scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue That being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen I find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is The action is good and the plot does suck you in Nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it s predecessors Completely worth your while 
With a story as detailed and absorbing as Xenosaga III s it s nearly impossible to not be hooked Xenosaga Episode I remains a type of paragon for a story and character driven RPG There was so much to tell in the game that players looking to sink their teeth into a 40 or so hour cinematic RPG wouldn t need to look any further and would also be very satisfied Episode II was a bit shorter and not quite as good as the first installment However Xenosaga III is as good as an RPG can get I love to watch films with solid plots and memorable meaningful characters It is a pleasure to experience a video game that can achieve that kind of involvement through a long period of 40+ hours Episode III throughout its duration constantly engrosses the player with the many plot developments flashbacks and insights into the many characters Every primary characater is respected with deep explorations into their own motives and agendas Everything about the game is meticulously crafted Every bit of plot and dialogue builds upon itself from the intro all the way to the conculsion and still there is room for much more to be pondered There are some very memorable music pieces in the game which really accecntuate the current mood They really serve to bring the emotional weight of the characters to life The voice acting is great all around There never is a moment when the acting sounds forced or laughable The difficulty is for the most part quite easy It is only until the near end of the game where some bosses may cause you to see the Game Over screen a few too many times I actually spent three days stuck on one boss The solution to this was to stay driven and continue to try different strategies The good thing is that your characters can be switched out at any time and even though the battle parties only consist of three members the rest of your comrades whether they are in battle or not will also receive experience points from fighting and will stay leveled with your main battle members This way you can use them later for crucial battles when they are needed without having to take the trouble to level them I enjoyed Xenosaga III from beginning to end A game like this is especially a treat to a player who appreciates an in depth character driven plot heavy game The philosophical and theological themes explored within in it raise many questions about human beings and the world There are characters who fight and give their lives for ideals There are also individuals who struggle to find the meaning in their own lives and what path they should take The role of destinty and fate are strong components in the game There is always something brewing throughout this adventure There is always something that captivates you and makes you think twice about setting the controller down 
A good conclusion to an underdeveloped premise Xenosaga Episode 1 took us in Although the flaws in that game were many the story was sufficiently entertaining and interesting to warrant the praise that was given to the game and the clunky play mechanics Xenosaga Episode 2 was awful Plain and simple it was awful Any of the interesting cliff hangers from episode 1 were either answered stupidly or not at all The game not only possessed a lackluster storyline with extra characters introduced merely for confusion s sake but I have NEVER seen a battle system more user unfriendly and more monotonous and clunky than that of episode 2 At times I wanted to throw my PS2 against the wall particularly when fighting the patriarch A terrible game which seemed to kill the series until Episode 3 which is a throwback to simpler RPG fare and works quite well In Episode 3 the battles are actually interesting to fight at least early on I enjoy the use of the boost counter for once No more will you guess at whether Shion s attack is useful against enemy A or whether you should switch to say chaos Instead characters are divided into three classes attackers defenders and supporters healers It s a pretty simple system no Also the story kicks back into high gear I won t spoil anything except to say that finally the Testaments which were alluded to in Episode 1 but completely ignored other than tangential referral in episode 2 have returned and let s face it Wilhelm is a much more compelling character than say a young Albedo Finally the wheels which began spinning in episode 1 come full circle In fact it seems as if episode 2 could have been skipped entirely with no loss of continuity There are numerous nods to Xenogears in this game and by the way the gear sequences are actually quite fun the character battles in episode two were only trumped in boredom by the gear battles In any case Xenosaga 3 is a worthy addition to the library It has flaws again it would be nice to have action sequences and movie sequences move more seamlessly although it s infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 but it s a fun game 
Might as well For newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it However if you ve already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable A few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore The story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game So if you ve been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you I however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line 
Best Game in the Series In my opinion this is the best game in the Xenosaga series The first game received a lot of well deserved praise and recognition However I believe this third game is better in just about every aspect The battle system is new and introduces the concept of Break The idea is to place your opponent in that state and avoiding it for your characters The turn based battle system is also very quick You don t have to wait 30 seconds for your characters to execute their battle moves The playable characters respond and attack as soon as you choose the type of attack that you want to perform As in the previous games you either fight on foot or aboard the giant E S humanoid machines Item and Equipment shops are back as well as the ability to customize your characters to a fine level You won t have as much options to choose as the first game but the ability is very close The best part of this game though is the story I am forty years old and have read many novels watched many great movies and played lots of video games In my opinion the story being told in this game surpasses anything that I have ever come across The plot is that good The characters are very well developed and seem to take on life as you play the game and watch the plot unfold There s action drama and revelations in just about every scene Each of the main plot from the previous episodes are brought to conclusion This is truly a masterpiece of story telling I can only hope that one day this very moving thought provoking captivating and uplifting story will be more accessible to people who don t play video games A lot of people will find it spiritual and philosophical Yes the theme is very serious and dramatic Unlike the more common whimsical theme of most games But trust me you will play for many hours non stop just to watch the plot unfold The concepts of destiny purpose free will choices life afterlife beliefs love despair and consequences are constantly present in the story The central character is Shion Uzuki the designer of the amazing android KOS MOS Allen and the rest of the supporting cast are back This time they are out to uncover a plot by Vector that could put the future of the universe in danger The mini game is there in case you want to take a break from the main story and enjoy a fun game of Hackox Ofcourse you have The Professor Jr and Allen to lighten things up just a bit also 
A brilliant addition and finish to the Xenosaga series Xenosaga Episode 3 Also sprach Zarathustra brings back the magic of Episode 1 and fixes the vast majority of the problems that occurred in Episode 2 The story here as rich and complex as ever is brought to an appropriate and moving close as Shion and company battle to uncover a deep seated conspiracy unlike anything else they ve ever encountered The fabric of the story itself the voice acting and the cutscenes are all truly superb it s remarkable that the makers at Namco Bandai managed to pull all of the loose ends together to make the story finally make sense To boot it s a pleasure to watch and listen to who could ask for more As for the battle system it finally regains its fun in Episode 3 I simply wasn t a fan of Episode 2 s system so the return to basics was a blessing in my mind The characters still do battle in their unique ways as each has his her own customizable skills to obtain but long gone are the days of ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies Here in both ground and E S mech battles your ability to strengthen and customize your party shines through and you are always rewarded for your hard work Replay value is moderate to high as well since your party consists of all the familiar players for most of the game if you have a habit of using the same three or four people like me yay for chaos you can always play through again with a different group Shops return in this Episode making buying and selling your merchandise once again possible The only thing lacking is this game is a little more in the extras side quests department of which this game only offers a handful While some of these take longer than others a few more side quests would have been nice particularly since this is the last in the series I can t rave enough about how impressed I was with this title It rivals Episode 1 in every way possible and the trilogy s epic story outstrips other RPG competition without question If you re looking for fun battles a fantastic story and beautiful graphics then look no further Xenosaga Episode 3 is for you I can only hope that someone changes their mind and decides to make another one after this exceptional closing Episode it s hard not to wish for another game to come along in the future Very highly recommended Summary Story A+ Cutscenes A Graphics Rendering A Battle Skill System A Extras Side Quests A Replay Value Moderate to Hig 
A Great Game Too bad its the last one This unfortunatly was the last Xenosaga Much inproved from Xenosaga II The game is playable once again It is nice to have some of the original actors and actreses back once again Momo was not fortunate enough to regain her original voice A few people are not happy about some of the scene editting from the Japanese to keep the rating of Teen in the united states but the ending was enough to make up for that For those fans who really liked the first and were disappointed with the secound that they did not finish it the game comes with a recap as long as your willing to read and you only lose Shion s Vector uniform for not having a cleared data file from Xenosaga II The only let down is that as a player we never get a chance to use Kos Mos Tertiary Weapons Those are the wings with the huge cannon seen in one She uses that cannon in one scene rather early on and then after that it is lost Like the first and secound this one has not only really strong biblical links but the resolution comes from people in the new testment No not Jesus All in all it is a great game and Shion s Speach at the end if your a sappy emotional person like me will leave you crying and that was more than enough to play through this game 
Xenosaga did it right this time The first Xenosaga was amazing to me I thought it had a wonderful storyline good battle system and other mechanics were good Episode II kind of felt like a really unpolished not yet ready for release Xenosaga Xenosaga III however does not disappoint While the game does have a lower budget and one can see this this gave the programmers the ability to focus on what really matters the gameplay and the storyline The storyline in this is awesome and what one comes to expect when dealing with a Xenosaga game The gameplay like the other Xenosagas is a little weak but still much better than Episode II Also since this game was kind of forced to be the last game in the series before its time the story has absolutely NO FILLER Its one exciting story after another Trust me for Xenosaga fans Sci Fi RPG fans you will love this game for RPG fans that also tend to focus on storyline rather than gameplay will love this also If you love dungeons and skip cutscenes than this game probably isnt for you Awesome game pick it up you wont be disappointed also its only 40 bucks so what do you have to lose 
Sony Playstation 2 Dualshock Controller Blue This controller is very nice and probably the best It works with big and small hands it feals non greasy unless you have greasy hands it has a nice vibration if you notice on some of the other controllers the vibration is too big Now I own a PlayStation 2 and i have played with a lot of other controllers but they dont last the buttons get pushed in the analog is too sensitive etc Although with this controler ive had it for 2 years and it has yet to break on me and people this is a sensitive object dont slam it it will work well as long as you take care of it Also the button reaction on this is the quickest I have seen with those big bulky ones the reaction is very bad and sometimes the analogs dont work properly You may have also seen this controller in black and teal there all the same price and all have the same durability the only differene is the color I rate this item 5 stars because its the best controller out there 
Great pad but Start and Select should ve been moved up a lil Playstation s Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it and they usually don t do a very good job Their d pads are always too awkward or their construction is too lightweight The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last I m an emulation gamer and thanks to SmartJoy s USB adapter I can use a real PS1 PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem My only gripes with the pad A The Start Select buttons really should ve been moved up after the addition of analog sticks I m always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select B While the d pad is very sturdy it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows 
always get the original 3rd party controllers tend to suck so buy this one instead It s light weight comfortable symmetrical great for fighting games an rather durable Plus the blue color is a rather good thing If you already own four working controllers there s no need to get this thing but if you don t I d recomend a pickup 
Perfect Blue Anybody out there with a controller hog who perhaps gets your controller sticky or messy or does something to it you don t even want to know about Different colored controllers are the key to solving this problem Mr Messy has his and you have yours It works out awesome I love my teal green controller and he loves his blue one You also get a year warranty which comes in the box with this controller in between the yellow cardboard so if there is a problem with in a year they will fix your controller Anyway it is the same size as the ones that come with your original PS2 The buttons are the same they move the same and feel the same The only difference is the color but still it s worth it to get a nice new non sticky controller and to get your self some distance from that controller hog I love this one they also make a teal colored one and I have seen a sponge bob controller out there as well but if its not made by Sony its probably not that reliable Stick with the best get a Sony controller and get in the game 
The original This is the original Playstation controller and it is the best It feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy If you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling I strongly reccommend do not buy the big Mad Catz controller It does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks Just stick with the Sony controler it is the best of the best 
PS2 DVD Remote by Sony This is an exceptional value Plug in the reciever and wa la Use the remote Personal experience says it can be used to play some games even 
final fantasy rpg finally to be honest I lost confident on squresoft after playing ffVIII and they pick up a little on ffIX then they mess the rpg formula on ffX ffXI and ffX 2 wherever they called those rpg games now they star fresh on ffXII very good game I just remenber when I played my first rpg s game ffII then ffIII on the snes not mention the clasic like chrono trigger secre of mana ff tactic s ffvII ogre tactic s for mhont s this game has the rpg root s and the music a clasic from ffII and some from fftactic s the graphi s are fantastic the new engine is a little pro and con since they are place s where you need to turn off the gamblic icom to finish a sequense and continous with the game very cleaver but good hope now on squre enix keep up the good work on keeping the francise fresh as this one exellent game recommended to any harcore rpg player 10 out 10 
Reminds me of Final Fantasy XI online Wow this game is a blend of Final Fantasy XI + Vagrant Story Some of the armor and creatures are from FFXI This is the perfect game for me since I miss the graphics and gameplay of FFXI online but I dont have 300+ hours of my life to sink into it so FFXII is the perfect alternative for Ex FFXI online players who have a life The battle system and graphics are amazing The skill development is a more complex than usual FF games so a young teenager might not be able to build their characters to their full potentials The only bad thing i can see with this game is the new Moogles design they look like rabbits now Who s idea was it to dump the pudgy fat hamster design 
A pretty good game I ve been playing Final Fantasy games since the beginning Having to buy spells weapons and everything reminds me of many of the early games which is good in my opinion Of course it s odd to have to also pay License Points for them It s not really a bad system there though The voice acting though not the worst is still not that great Then again I prefer the Japanese language tracks The way I see it they can subtitle these games and if someone is too lazy to read they shouldn t be playing an RPG to begin with since that has always been a big part of any RPG Now for the worst part about this game The camera Sometimes it seems to jump anywhere except for where it would be useful in smaller areas Plus when you try to pan left the camera pans right and when you try to pan right the camera pans left I talked to someone who played FFXI and they say it s similar except that the camera pans the way you press I think it was meant to be like that but someone miscoded and rather than take the time to fix it they decided to just release the game The plot though I have not gone far in the game yet seems to be a rather decent plot though still rathr generic Of course it s diffcult to create a nongeneric plot these days since most plots have already been used Favorite RPG Chrono Trigger Favorite Final Fantasy Final Fantasy IX Least Favorite Final Fantasy Final Fantasy VIII Least Favorite RPG Sailor Moon RPG 
A very fun game I think this might be one of my favorites from the FF series I think all of the characters are awesome And their overdrives are very cool too 
Finally thank you After the long wait I m glad to say that this game is as consuming and distracting as previous titles have been There are some great tweaks to the gameplay such as active battle mode more along the lines of KOTOR than previous FF games Overall the story is classic FF as are the characters with superb graphics for PS2 and most importantly the gameplay and strategy are fantastic As with previous FF games excluding XI there are several different things to pursue at one time with varying side quests instead of the straightforward linear forceful approach that some games employ 
The Best Thus Far Though many hardcore FFVII or FFX gamers may disagree FFXII is simply the BEST of the Final Fantasy games It is the best reviewed game of the PS2 and one of the best of all time Addressing the obvious the graphics music and voiceovers are the best though the soundtrack for FFVII is about equal The movie cutscenes will make you do a double take thinking you re playing a PS3 game What really set this game apart is the in game control systems First off NO MORE FIXED CAMERA ANGLES Seriously that is one of the best parts of the game Second the battle system I was reluctant at first when I saw the previews but it is the best battle system yet It s fully real time battles BUT it pauses when you re making choices through the menu a GREAT feature you can even go into your main menu during battles to buy use things called license points to power up your character or switch out characters for better strategies It seems the most controversial new game system is the license system Basically you have to buy using license points lp the license to use a type of weapon or magick or other type of power up But you get at least one LP for each creature you kill so it goes by fast In many ways it s like the grid system in FFX however it vastly improves on this encompassing COMPLETE CUSTOMABILITY of characters Everything from weapon type choice to health and magick powerups are up to you Frankly no other system can beat this sorry to the materia lovers Buy it The LAST GREAT GAME of the Playstation 2 
THE game to own on Wii I picked up a wii with this game on launch day after much research Let me just say that I own NES i got used N64 Dreamcast GC and now Wii I was getting tired of gaming I am definitely not a hardcore gamer and in my precious free hours when I come home from work I don t want to sit around and get fat that s what TV is for Anyway this game really gets you moving The mini games are often hilarious you WILL randomly LOL while playing and fun The shooting levels that end each set of mini games utilize the wii controller in the most natural way and it is immersive and intuitive I played this game to about 33 completion the first day I had it This is unusual for me I figure I ll get about ten hours of gameplay out of story mode if things continue at the present pace The game gives you an objective early on and this motivates you to progress through the mini games I like them so much that I have gone back and beaten the optional 4th mini game in each level I ve passed I can t speak for any of the other launch titles but I haven t had this much fun in single player gaming on a console ever And all of the mini games and shooting games you shoot plungers by the way are available for multiplayer after they have been beaten although some of them cannot be played concurrently by multiple players On a final note some of the mini games will physically wear you out Some of the games involving rapid movement running cow milking cow tossing carrot juice pumping may require you to catch your breath If you can t handle this then you ll be glad to know you can skip one of the mini games in each level But this physical exertion makes beating a mini game much more gratifying I cannot recommend this strongly enough Get this game 
Bunny s Dont Dissapoint This game is simply amazing The mini games are addictive and hilarious This was my first game for the wii and its been sitting patiently next to me FOREVER really only 1 day If you are a fan of comedy adventures if there were ever any before you have GOT to pick this game up Its not a quick fix this game will keep you busy for a great while Its simply hilarious and fun to play simple as that The life is extended through multiplayer Deffiantly Buy this Game It will own you AaarrrghhhhhH 
Fun Game INTRO I know that some people if I may quote the other reveiwer Mr B think this game is not easy for normal humans but seriously it is a good game Don t base it on whether a level or two is challenging Would you like it better if it was a piece of cake I sure as heck wouldn t To be fair I did have some trouble with levels Rift River some parts of the Planetarium etc GAMEPLAY Tak 2 plays very nicely as far as games go Environments and animals and people are so nicely done and the levels are varied not like you re in one area for the whole game The music is easily listenable to not like some other obnoxious video game music example being Kingdom Hearts Traverse Town music Forigve me The fighting system is basically button mashing at the beginning but it develops as you get new juju powers and learn combo attacks I also enjoyed the animal changing parts of the game true some parts were unbeliveably annoying like when you re a flying squirrel juju runs out and you plummet to your death kind annoying but I still liked the idea of being able to change into bears squirrels frogs and boars This game s graphics do the animators credit It s awesome how Tak s moves look so realistic when he s in water or in mud or tipetoeing or jumping or whatever PROS AND CONS Pros 1 Amazing animation 2 Funny dialouge 3 For once a game with good music 4 Nice fighting system 5 Awsome animal changes 6 Just darn fun to play and beat Cons 1 Some really hard killer levels I had a ton of trouble with the darts in Gloomleaf Swamp bleh 2 A few glitches and bugs in this game 3 Augh Loading times OVERALL I d definitely say buy it if not rent it It s really fun and has a ton of replay value 
Ok but not great I went the bargain route and I got what I paid for It works fine but it looks cheap sitting next to my high end receiver remote I ended up using my wireless controller for movie playback 
Does the trick I ve had DVD players come and go so its kinda cool to have a gaming console that plays dvd s too Yeah I know the PS2 has that capability without a remote I have one of those too But one of the cool things I noticed about the X Box playback kit is that the remote looks just like the ones made by RCA I tried a few of the controls on the DVD funtion of my RCA universal remote low and behold it worked Kinda a hand thing I ve got to many remotes floting around as it is so that part was nice Mine works great I use it instead of having to re arrange my already overpacked entertainment center to put in my other DVD player 
Very good I found this product good i have no problems with it what so ever some people say just buy a dvd player but then you have more wires in the back of your tv Also if you want your x box and dvd player to go into one suround sound or stereo the is great cause you get to have a dvd player and a x box in one wire going into the speakers this is also great if you dont want to spend any more money on buying another dvd player and you already have a xbox i have my xbox upstairs with the dvd adapter and a dvd player down stairs so if i want a change of secnery i love my xbox and it s adapter i have no problem with the remote either 
Fun fun and more fun Awesome game loads of fun All a guy needs Women Money Cars Power not necessarily in that order 
Incredible City Cludgy Controls At first glance the average person might assume that the appeal of Grand Theft Auto is in the graphic violence swearing and mature content but the truth is the GTA series is revolutionary technological achievement and remains one of the most impressive experiences you can find in gaming The first time I ever tried GTA Liberty City I was absolutely blown away by the size and scope of the fully realized living city It was the same feeling I got the first time I played Mario 64 in that I recognized that I was witnessing a major leap forward Now almost 10 years later Rockstar has treated us with their latest effort GTA San Andreas Liberty City was the prototypical big east coast city while Vice City was a combination of Vegas and southern Florida San Andreas takes gamers to the west coast with shades of San Francisco LA and points in between As always the city is gigantic and fully realized in a way that the True Crime series could only dream of In fact I noticed a billboard in San Andreas mocking True Crime GTA has always been about freedom the freedom to walk drive or bicycle wherever you want the freedom to walk up and pop someone in the mouth if you want Sure it s violent but consider it wish fulfillment for those of us with an inner anarchist who desires expression without the messiness of accountability The only other game that even approached GTA s scale was Mafia but Mafia was saddled by unforgiving law enforcement that wouldn t even allow players to run red lights Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and palm trees in San Andreas The vehicles are extremely difficult to control The problem is that the vehicle movement and camera angle work independently which means that when you make a turn using the keyboard you have to quickly swing the camera around using the mouse to realign yourself Even after considerable practice I still found it very challenging and awkward Shooting is likewise rather challenging to perform and I just don t remember it being this hard in the two previous games The other surprise was how taxing the game is on my PC I played the first two GTA on a significantly weaker machine and was surprised that I couldn t max out all settings on San Andreas I had to pull in the drawing distance significantly to keep the frame rate up while using a P4 3 0 GHz with 1 Gig of memory and an ATI RADEON X600 graphics card I have to knock one star off because of the awkward controls but GTA is one of those games you could spend a month on and never get board Just exploring the city is worth the price of admission 
Are this cables gonna work for the PS3 I ve read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the PS3 Since the PS3 originally only comes with the traditional wires AV cables im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal hd pic quality Or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones 
Just what the doctor ordered Very good cable Get it if you have a PS2 and a component input on your TV Much better picture than composite cables 
Definate improvement over the standard composite cable This component cable offers a clearer crisper picture on my LG LCD HDTV than the composite cable However it does have a downside The clearer picture exposes the edges of the polygons that make up the figures in games which you don t see on the composite cable It makes them appear a little rough but overall it is a better picture 
not bad using a 21inch sony crt tv wega definitely improves clarity of fonts text colors are brighter as well as vivid and some graphical elements are crisper newer generation games tekken 5 benefit from this and have immediately noticeable improvements but for older games the improvements are not as noticeable but the graphics do seem crisper and cleaner as compared to before 
Finally enjoying my HDTV to its full extent When I first got my HDTV I tried my PS2 on it and although the widescreen feature was nice the picture was grainy I was disappointed but I knew I must have missed something That something is these cables If you want your games to look good on your HDTV you NEED these cables Such a difference I can t believe I got such an improvement for this price Seriously if you spent the money on the tv spend on the money on the cables cause you re only as strong as your weakest link 
Don t bother with any other brand Don t waste your money on Monster Cable or better componenet cables This one has a razor sharp image and no rf interference And the best thing about going with the sony brand is that the PS2 side plug fits perfectly unlike others which their own mold and jiggles Makes my 56 Pioneer Elite TV look like a computer monitor go to hdtvarcade website for a complete listing of PS2 games video resolutions and sound 
WOW Greatest Star Wars Game Ever Period I got this game the day it came out and I still can t stop playing it This game has everything that the original one didn t The new levels are awesome and the heroes are great Oh and it helps that the heroes aren t immortal anymore like in Battlefront 1 Unfortunately some of the best levels from 1 are missing in 2 such as Bespin and Tatooine But if you have xbox live you can get them + 2 heroes for just 4 99 A MUST HAVE FOR ALL STAR WARS FANS AND GAMERS ALIKE 
hours of fun My 8 and 10 year old LOVE this I highly recommed it to anyone It helps teach kids how to sing with pitches and tones The kids love to dress up their characters Even the boys in the neighborhood get invovled I see this lasting for years to come 
GREAT FUN but limited This game is very fun because you are able to change and or create your own characters in many different ways there s different games you can play than just plain karaoke and it has ways of encouraging you to do better Each location you can choose from has fun things that happen when you sing more in tune like if you sing on the rooftop of a building and you re doing AWESOME a helicopter comes by and starts filming you on live cam It s a lot like American Idol in how you re glamourized The only thing I don t like about it is that the song choice is limited There s ways you can earn new songs by doing well but I wish there was a way you could add more songs to the songlist that we personally could choose 
Karaoke Revolution Party Volume IV This game is so much fun I don t own it but my friend does and I want to get it for my birthday But I think I should tell you why exactly anyone needs to own this game First of all there are 50 songs to sing Some you have to unlock but all you have to do is sing an already available song You re rated on the notes you are supposed to sing and if you don t exactly know the lyrics you can just hum along if you want to There is a character editor where you can make your name characteristics and clothing for a character Or you can pick an already made character The thing which is totally descriptive is that you can pick the body type of your character muscular curvy skinny the works There are unlockables too Over the course of the game you unlock songs outfits and accessories You can also do medly and sing off activities Medly is when you pick 5 songs and sing individual parts of each of them Sing off I can t remember if that is the actual name is when you do different types of styles of the game So you can do short song medly and all kinds of other things Then you can see who will be named champion of karaoke This game is incredibly fun and enjoyable as you can see If you do buy it I suggest you buy two microphones then you can sing duets also incredibly fun This game is perfect for all ages my neighbors have children at the age of 7 and he loves singing his heart out to some of his favorite songs So take my word for it and you will be thankful you did 
This game ROCKS Santa brought this game and I don t think we ve stopped playing since It is such a blast and really brings the family together We were all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum on Brick House it was our last one left that wasn t platinum the other day It has a great variety of songs new and old Another reviewer said there weren t enough new songs and I disagree My friends daughters 21 and 16 even commented on how many new ones there were but they still chose to sing Take On Me from the 80 s My 8 year old and my husband have gotten perfect scores on Material Girl In fact my daughter loves all the old 80 s tunes The only problem we ve had with this game is that the arrows don t show up for the dancing We don t have a mat but we tried it at someone else s house Anyway I m sure we ll get that squared away by the time we get a mat I cannot recommend this game enough Don t get the headset the regular mics are better be sure to get two for duets 
Karaoke Revolution Party Volume 4 for the PS2 I recieved this as a gift for Christmas day as a surprise However there was a mishap at Wal Mart I guess and the mic they told my parents would work actually didn t so I hadn t been able to play until yesterday However now that it s all sorted out I was finally able to play using the USB PS2 head set And the game is actually so much fun First time I tried I went to familiar songs so I selected Pieces of Me I did so bad for the first time it was laughable it failed me just as I started the second verse But the game gets so much better after your first few tries After a while I was easily getting Gold on expert judging I immidiately like the challenge myself I was breezing through songs I grew up loving such as Irene Cara s Fame Wild Cherry s Play That Funky Music and Vicki Sue Robinson s Turn The Beat Around Then I was going through songs that were dominating my CD player not too long ago such as Ashlee Simpson s Pieces of Me Incubus Drive Beyonce s Crazy in Love and Hilary Duff s Fly And it s even better with classics such as Madonna s Material Girl Blondie s Call Me The Commodores Brick House and Whitney Houston I Will Always Love You one of the many I haven t quite nailed yet Now in order to make platinum from Beyonce do you have to actually sing like her No which makes the game very accessable However it doesn t hurt to be familiar with your singing voice Over all this is a very fun game with only one problem While the songs may be fun it s very VERY diverse Sometimes too diverse for it s own good Take for example that when me and my Mom want to play the songs we personally know are from two different erras I m wanting to bust out with Call Me and she s wanting to do I Left My Heart In San Francisco This can creates the only problem that unless your an all around music know it all which I m not quite there yet you ll end up doing the same songs over and over again But this really doesn t bring the game down If you ve been around and listened to a wide variety of songs then you should be able to cover a good 30 songs And not to mention it would make a great party game I would suggest getting this game if you re into having fun while not being afraid to make a fool of yourself 
Okami Review I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12 and she has had a ball playing it Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese that doesn t take away from the game s adventures The instructions given are very clear and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks it really is quite enjoyabl 
Zelda for the PS2 Okami is a fantastic game perhaps the last great game released on the PS2 Stylish fun and packed with a good bit of humor this game kept me occupied for over a week Although it can certainly be played a good bit faster most people will probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through the first time The action adventure style gameplay owes quite a bit to the Zelda series but the celestial brush adds a nice and original gameplay element Okami is not overly difficult I found it a bit on the easy side The camera can also be a bit troublesome in a few places as well but I would be hard pressed to find many other faults with this game Unless you have a real dislike for cel shaded graphics I would heartily recommend this game for any PS2 owner 
Innovative and beautiful This is the most unique game in recent years Okami is a mixture of different gameplay Prior to buying this game I was expecting more combat You control a reincarnated god wolf and travel thru many beautiful scenaries You will talk to people solve simple fun puzzles do some platforming collect weapons play mini games and fight cool enemies Your goal is to save ancient Japan from demons The setting is very unique Its Japanese mythology with cell shaded graphic which resembles Ancient Japanese water oil painting There are cool Japanese style towns cherry blossoms trees beautiful environment and mythological enemies beast with a Japanese twist A visual pleasing game You will want to see what the next level looks like its like traveling The bosses are really cool too The characters are zany and funny One disappointment is the lack of voice acting you have to read text Minus 0 5 points for overall score The combat portion does not happen during the normal game there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined border A unique aspect of this game is the celestrial brush Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush There are many different brush powers You can draw and fill missing bridge gap draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day These are few examples The game difficulty is pretty easy Overall a fun adventure ride for everyone all ages and players Graphics 4 5 5 Music Sound 5 5 Story 5 5 Gameplay 4 5 Design 5 5 Fun 4 5 5 Value 5 5 Overall 4 5 
You don t have this game yet I will keep this review short The game is a very addictive entertaining RPG Great story great gameplay best game I played all year Only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies Took me about 45 hours to complete the Main story and almost all of the side missions If you buy this game you WILL play it to the end 
I thought there could be more I thought that there could have been more to some of the story line I v been playing GTA Vice City San Andreais and like the stoury line But overall I was pleased with the game 
This IS a Classic I ve owned this game since 3 weeks after it first came out and I have nothing but praise for this masterpiece of a game After two equally as amazing sequels that feature so much more than GTA 3 one would think that my opinion of this game has diminished but it hasn t I still remember playing this game for the first time I d just sit in my room for hours staring with my mouth hanging open just taken back by everything such as the very fun missions the enormous environment or the fact I could just run around and do whatever I wanted WHENEVER I wanted Another fabulous part of this game is the radio Surprisingly alot of these songs are actually good I ve never heard of any of the people who sing them but stations like Head radio and Flashback feature some surprisingly catchy tracks that add an additional lightness to this already darkly humorous game However Chatterbox is probably the best which features a ton of dry sarcastic and often hilarious humour For such an enormous environment one would have to give the graphics a bit of recognition Obviously their not perfect and there are many games with MUCH better graphics than this game but these graphics are still pretty damn good The cars look really awesome and all the characters including the pedestrians are surprisingly well detailed However the main thing about this game is that its fun ALOT of fun There is so much more that you can do rather than just missions You can do a variety of sub missions which include becoming a taxi driver a law enforcer an ambulance driver and even a firefighter all of which allow you to earn a bit of money The guns are also really cool and you can have alot of fun with them especially weapons like the grenades and rocket launcher Another thing to note is that this particular game has ALOT of glitches but they aren t evident For example at the beginning of the game you see yourself robbing a bank in an unidentified part of some city Well later on if you manage to figure out the irritating Dodo plane that s right there is a flyable plane you can actually find that section of city Overall this is one of the best games for Playstation 2 Pretty much any person who isn t jaded when it comes to video games and just wants to have alot fun for a very long time should buy this game There isn t much of a story but who cares This game KICKS ASS and any gamer should buy this Don t rent this game just go and buy it RIGHT NOW You won t regret it I promise One thing to note however is that it is very violent and there is a fair bit of cursing You can also solicit prostitutes and if you drive to a quiet place your car will start bouncing just so the parents know With that in mind the game still kicks alot of ass 
Review in retrospect Several years and several sequels have passed now so is GTA III really worth the time I d definitely say so This game continues to be incredibly fun years later You can pick it up and just have a play or you can advance through the stories Each is engaging and creative just like the sequels When it comes down to it this is a great game and it still holds its weight against the sequels and the knock off games It s a definite buy 
An undeniably exciting RPG Fable has reached the point where all RPGs dream of going It s absolutely the pinnacle of the Adventure criteria The creators put you in the game they make it fun and they make it interesting Fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side dark side thing Because no other game concentrates on the subtle small important details and leisures quite like Fable does People will learn to adore you and people will learn to fear you you have a life you re not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do You hear that Fable is life It s adventure With a hint of unrealism just to the point to make you eternally amused to never decease until the fat lady sings Battle System 9 It s not guns it s not shoot em up blowing their brains out It s classic swordsplay and acrobatics blocking stabbing leaping lunging ducking dodging running away nothing to say except die Not to mention you can eat pie And it s all realistic hitting someone in the back the head the torso all cause different amounts of damage there s decapitations if you re lucky And the game even keeps track of your decapititations how cool is that There s archery shoot someone with and arrow the further you pull back your arrow the more damage it does but the less accurate it is You see Realism Plain clear and simple just like the drive thru guy ordered Leisure and life 9 Flirt with chicks flirt with guys Eww Flirt with chickens Whatever Flirt with anything with a face Get a special haircut facial hair tatoos some chicks find them attractive some scary Some may think you re Michael Jackson with a sword and get the heck away from you Hey that s life right One of the first games ever to allow you to get married to any woman or man and actually have sexual intercourse with them Yep you heard me sex Don t get cought up on the kinkiness boys it lasts for 5 seconds when the screen goes blank it s only for crickets and giggles Buy a house rent out your house live in your house steal from anyone kill anyone picklock doors fish dig kick chickens abuse your wife whatever you wanna do you can probably do it in Fable Main adventure 10 Yes this game is not all just chicken kicking There is a plot Filled with with surprises cliff hangers and ultimate rewards Gameplay 4 Quite possibly the only downside to this game It s TOO EASY I completed the game naked and didn t die once There is no way to change your difficulty This does however make the game much more fun as you don t have to reload and just get lucky in order to defeat an enemy But in all sincerity you may very well just whiz your way past this game in mere hours if you put your mind to it But then again that is why I am thankful for all the bonus material in the game because the actual game itself can go by pretty fast It may seem confusing and hard to get at first but all RPGs do so just stick with it 
Fable An incredible game it has very in depth graphics and a great story line The beauty of the game is that there is a lot of freedom in character development You can choose to be good or evil depending on every action you take The game was a little too short but the gameplay and graphics make up for it This is a must buy for anybody with an xbox 
I Thought I Knew Fable was a much anticipated RPG that promised 40 50 hours of gamer action in the storyline and complete control over the life of the protagonist We waited for this game for what seemed like a LIFETIME and the build up for the game to finally arrive was almost more than RPG lovers could take but did it live up to the hype No my fellow gamers And it hurts me so to say it While the game promised to deliver several hours of stoyline play I was shocked when I completed the main storyline in less than 20 hours Now I m not one to doubt the sacred words of Lionhead Studios so I dedicated another 20 hours of my life to uncover different aspects of gameplay such as getting married changing outfits and body types becoming divinely evil or majestically good ect but it was all just so linear The paths were set the storyline already thought out and the character chosen you weren t given enough to keep the interest going I later dragged myself back to the game to play the storyline through again and though I admit that I enjoyed the game much more the second time through I just found myself not caring about it all Too many options were closed and the darn story was just too short The darker elements of the game were simply addicting such as the colleseum the prison which I played over and over and over and the story of your sister but it seems as though the people in charge of developing such side stories which we all SO LOVE got a little case of A D D Now I m not saying to avoid this game It s got just what some gamers may need to get into RPG s but for those of us who were expecting a game to completely pwn Morrowind well let s just move on or wait for a better thought our sequal crosses fingers 
A very good RPG with some flaws I have played through Fable and The Lost Chapters several times All in all this is a very fun game The classic RPG elements of leveling up buying or finding new and better weapons and armor choosing to focus on magic use or hack and slash and choosing to be good or evil are all included in Fable The graphics are superb for its time and the voice acting is top notch In addition the storyline is quite good and is more complex than the average RPG save the world tale I have heard some complaints of Fable being too short but if you take all the quests and max out all levels the game length should be just fine unless you are expecting a 50+ hours Morrowind experience Where Fable loses some points is the controller setup The button configuration can be overwhelmingly complex so much so that finding yourself using an item you did not mean to use can be a frequent occurance In addition you may find yourself using magic at an inopportune time simply because you pressed the R trigger by mistake The bow aiming feature might pop on at a bad time like when you are being attacked by 4 creatures and while rotating the camera view the map pop up might fill your screen as you are in the midst of battle thus obscuring your view Also Fable does tend to have some save problems You may complete some quests and save and upon reloading the quests may have to be recompleted or worse may not have been saved and will not be offered again Still these are rather minor complaints While Fable really doesn t live up to its advertising of being an all immersive RPG it is quite good and a blast to play if you like D D styled RPG s If you like Zelda games but wish they were more adult definitely check out Fable 
One of the few good RPG s out there When I first started playing fable I was amazed how much possibility there was to forge your own destiny Where one simple decision could alter your destiny for good or evil forever When you start out as a young boy who s village is burned plundered and the entire town murdered you feel sorry for the boy as his life has been taken from him From then on he is to become a hero As you embark on a long journey and make choices along the way you will forge you own personal destiny With a well written storyline to back it up this game amplifies your freedom to forge your destiny 
AND 1 Streetball Great game made by basketball fans for basketball nuts Like how easy is to alley oop to self and player It s fast and responsive I had no problem with my copy on the slim PS2 as reported Most be a bad PS2 that kid has 
A great Launch game For those of you who played Trauma Center on the DS this game is the same old same old but still worth the buy for you can play it on a full size tv For those of you who have not played the game the game is one of the most unique and challenging games i have ever played As one can tell from the pictures you are a surgeon who does everything from remove glass to fighting wierd bug things that live inside people The game is a great port from the DS and the Wiimote controls great in this game I highly recommend this game 
energetic My kids 11 and 7 2nd and 6th graders first played this game at a friend s house They both begged for it They have not stopped playing with it The thing is that we live in Texas and sometimes it is just way too hot to play outside There are always news reports about kids just sitting around This game makes you MOVE They played so hard the first day that they got it that they were both so sore the next day I recommend this toy for several people First if you need to get your kid moving this is great If you have hyper children that need an outlet this is great If you need to exercise more this is great If the weather doesn t permit your active kid to go outsice this toy is great If your kid wants to see him or herself on TV this is great If your kid is afraid to try new things in front of others this is great This toy got my boy to sign up for little league Both of my kids are already active so they play hard but it is an irresistable temptation for even inactive kids Everyone in the neighborhood loves it 
Great fun My son 11 years old and I have played this together and had a blast It is fun to watch him play alone too When his cousins come over they all take turns playing together and seem to really like it Great fun for rainy days 
Eye Toy Gets you moving With a hot summer I found my kids 7 10 playing more and more video games we purchased the eye toy and they had a blast getting up and moving the interaction was alot of fun 
All 4 my son I ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store Little did I know that I actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here He loves it He actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well It was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own We are very pleased with this purchase 
Karaoke on your schedule When I heard about this game at first I was stunned DDR and Guitar Hero are both games that focus on dance like and guitar like motions but they do not rely on the actual ability to dance or the actual ability to play guitar merely on combinations of responses through specialized controllers Karaoke Revolution however actually guages the accuracy of your singing Your performance is based on how closely to the original song you sing your version measured by pitch of the voice I would have expected as in the tradition of DDR and Guitar Hero that Karaoke Revolution would be simplified singing hitting certain buttons on a controller to produce certain singing notes on the screen But no this game uses a real microphone and your real voice The game also uses popular karaoke songs that are universally singable It may not be entirely of my genre of music that I would sing at a karaoke bar but almost all of the songs I have heard of and can make a passable attempt at singing and there is a wide spread across genres and across eras so that most genres are represented and there is both older and very modern music I have only used this game by myself to sing and practice songs for actual karaoke but I can imagine this game being incredibly fun with a party as well It uses the actual versions of the songs and is essentially like competitive karaoke And beyond that it also has a straightforward Karaoke feature that plays the karaoke versions of the songs complete with words for straight up karaoke for parties and such This game is one of several of this genre and I am personally looking forward to playing all of them My only critique is that there are limited numbers of songs and thus for me at least limited playing time If there was an on line version of this game that could access a much larger database of songs to play much like at a karaoke bar I would gladly pay a monthly fee to play such a game Let s hope such a thing is in the works 
This game is Fantabulous Of all the Karaoke games we have used this is by far the best It s fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters It has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have THere are the are different options like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score Hours of FUN FUN FUN 
It s Grrrrreat My daughter and her friends can play for hours They love it 
Awsome I never want to leave my freinds houses I dont have this games but my freind had a party and we played it nonstop It is a awsome game but the only place i can find that noncountry ones are at carcut city And when I went theresomeone had baught it before me I am so happy i found it on Amazon I love it and it I have to say is one of the only reasons why I want to leave with my freinds Juat Kidding If you love to sing and want to be a famous singer this is the game 4 you I think it helps you sing better because it tells you the pich and if you dont get the right pitch it comes of your score 
FAMILY FUN This is our 2nd Karaoke Revolution as we have the original one as well It was amazing to see how they evolved With a family of 7 there is not too many games that allow us to play as individuals Well this game delivers that and more The boys love the minigames the girls love to change their characters clothes based on how they feel and all of us love to sing We are not the Von Trapp family by any means but we can certainly have fun That s what the game delivers After a long week of stress work and school we have a Saturday night of Karaoke The kids love it This by far is the best investment into family time that we have ever made 
My Kids Love This This is so wonderful I have a 7yr old boy and a 9yr old girl and they cannot get enough of this My 9yr old had a sleep over and the other girls now want to come over all the time to play I even have had some of the parents inquiring about it This is so much fun even my husband and I have a great time playing The kids love that you can creat your own characters and change their outfits anytime and when you do well you can unlock new songs and outfits We can t wait to get another microphone so we can do more 
Final Fantasy III Old School but well worth it I honestly don t see why Square Enix hasn t thought of doing this to all their older Final Fantasy games really It would definitely appeal to the newer Final Fantasy audiences who s grownup on all the 3 D games all the while giving them a good history lesson on the FF games yet appeal to us older Final Fantasy fans with its old school style I liked it better when the stories were simpler to follow That s not to say I dislike the newer Final Fantasy games though Things change through the years as do I and I love those games just as much The game starts off with you Luneth assembling a team of heroes Arc Refia and Ingus to restore balance to the world To do this you must choose jobs 23 in all to help aid you in your quest Every battle you play through will add to each of the character s job level so you ll want to use thought in building not only your characters main level but also their job proficiency as well Although Final Fantasy III is a Very challenging game it s also an entertaining one I wish the Nintendo DS had more RPGs done in this style I simply couldn t get enough of the game and kept on finding myself fighting one more battle whatnot before putting it down You ll explore the lands man a boat pilot an airship ride a chocobo find treasure and more Not only that but the game is simply beautiful I agree it s simply a better overall experience in 3 D All in all you re looking at an RPG that clocks in around the 50 60 hour mark depending on how you play With new side quests and moogle mail you ll have a bit more to play Final Fantasy III is a DS gem that shouldn t be missed 
great game well i ve played this for a few hours since it just came yesterday but i m already very impressed the graphics are incredible i didn t think the ds was capable of such pretty 3 d with zoom graphics there are 23 different job classes in the game ex white wizard knight sage etc which fans of final fantasy tactics will recognize being able to shift jobs and work towards more powerful ones melds the best of rpg and tactics in other words crazy awesome good will probably be the handheld game of the year and will probably be the biggest rpg of the christmas season 
Complete the Final Fantasy Collection After sixteen long years Final Fantasy III finally sees an official release outside of Japan However unlike previous games Final Fantasy III has been completely reworked This is more than just a port with enhanced graphics Final Fantasy III includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul Final Fantasy III may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans but was the wait really worth it Well yes but the game isn t perfect The storyline of Final Fantasy III is entirely too simple The crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness Sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story but when compared to your average RPG today and current Final Fantasy games the storyline to Final Fantasy III is a joke There s nothing in this story that screams epic and the characters involved aren t developed very well Luckily we can let it slide because its sixteen years old Gameplay wise Final Fantasy III is pretty similar to most RPGs of today You ll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles There are a few quirks to the game that the DS utilizes You ll find moments where you ll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine It should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game Using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to by gliding it across the screen Taping on things makes your character examine it and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people It works out but it feels really clumbsy at times If you re looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle just stick to the directional buttons To its credit though using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster but for the most part the stylus controls just feel tacked on Combat is traditional turn based combat There s no ATB gauge like in later Final Fantasy games In each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do and then watch a round of battle take place It s simple but isn t always fun Mainly because Final Fantasy III is a challenge If you began with some of the later Final Fantasy games then this installment may be a little too difficult Sometimes combat is unforgiving especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn and have the power to take out a character in a single shot Even worse the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you ll fail so many times trying to do so You ll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times There are several moments when you ll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up This is fine for those used to old school RPGs but many RPGs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up and it may try your patience after a while It s great for people looking for a challenge at least but for some it may be a bit too steep The job system is interesting As you go through the game you ll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs Each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it For example White mages specialize in the healing arts black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both You ve also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members thieves who can steal and much more There are 23 jobs in all and the possibilities are nearly endless The jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats Mages for example don t have a lot of strength but they excel in magic Also as you gain levels you ll also gain job levels So it s not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level but also at a good job level The game looks absolutely stunning at least for the Nintendo DS It is by far one of the best looking out there There are some moments where it looks pixilated but you can t deny that the game just looks good regardless The movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well In battle is also fantastic Your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle On the whole the game just looks good Perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat Your characters won t physically go up and strike an enemy Rather they just step forward and swing Very similar to how the Final Fantasy games of the NES worked It s strange to see but you ll quickly get used to it Another thing that seems kind of strange though is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank All the action takes place on the bottom screen There are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything You ll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you re in towns There are certain moments where the top screen has text or shows an important story sequence but that s usually about it Other than that when trumping through dungeons as you do often and in battle as you also do often the top screen remains blank There s nothing wrong with it but it feels very awkward to play a Nintendo DS game where the top screen is blank They could ve used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something The top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever The music in the game is pretty good though It s not as good as other games in the series and there are some tunes that just aren t great but the music is by no means bad There s no voice acting in the game really but we can let that slide Audio wise the game is good Final Fantasy III is a pretty satisfying experience for any Final Fantasy fan looking for a good challenge and to see how far the series has come However it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas particularly its unforgiving challenge Still it s worth it for Final Fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come The Good +Finally a chance to play Final Fantasy III +Great visual look +Good music +The job system is interesting +It provides a good challenge +A fair amount of secrets and sidequests The Bad The story is not all that great For some the game might provide too much of a challenge to the point of frustration High random encounter rate Throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just blank for a Nintendo DS game this just feels awkwar 
Great game The only problem I had with this game I use a steering wheel and it keeps locking up but with the game pad it doesn t This is a very fun and hard game to play I m not done with it yet but I love the cars and the graphics and the races This is really a great game There are parts of the game where you can race for money or for fun and all the races are fun to play When I need to race I normally pick this game most of the time 
Patience required The only faults I can find in this otherwise great game are the horribly long load times and how long it takes to get a decent car to race with The game is very addictive especially when it comes to tuning your hard won new car Customization of your car is extremely detailed and is almost as fun as racing The computer cars give you a real challenge in certain types of races but you can change the difficulty level if you find it to be a little too hard at first The scenery is gorgeous Being able to drive anywhere you want is really fun too I actually prefer this game over EA s newer release Most Wanted I would recommend this game but patience is needed for your first few hours of gameplay 
Great fun if you like driving from shop to shop and from race to race Pros Almost unlimited customization for your car s in depth tuning can be great fun to play sometimes when you are actually racing some of the in game effects like weather are done well graphics are good but not nearly as good as GT4 Cons unrealistic but I suppose that s not the point of this game can t some combine the realistic driving engine from Gran Turismo and the customization from a game like this the possiblities would be amazing you have to drive EVERYWHERE I want to f ing race not spend five minutes driving from the performance shop to the graphics shop before driving another five minutes to the actual race to progress in the game you need to raise your car s rating and the only way to get the really high ratings is to put gawding looking crap on your car like spinners massive hood scoops and huge wings that make your car look like its being attacked by a UFO please some of us actually have taste and like our cars to look tastefully done Overall an OK arcadish game that anyone who likes to drive around not racing and putting terribly ugly crap on your cars will probably have a lot of fun with but I think I ll stick with the Gran Turismo series 
I dont play racers much but this game IS GOOD I liked SSX series sequel 3 being the best but I didn t play racers I bought first NFSU and disliked choppy animation I got part two just out of curiosity and I liked it so much I beat the game Basically you are newbie in Bayview City and you race different type of races and build rep and your car You must tune your car for each type of race and you must check shops frequently There are various shops from visual effect and paint shops to ones which improve your car speed handling etc Races are also different you have races on isolated tracks races in live trafic Street X races in confined and cramped space without nitro option with lot dirty driving and hitting short tracks in which you win if you shift the gear in time and my favorites drift races in which you win if you get most points not if you pass the line first Drift races are won by breaking and steering in order to make long trail I used automatic shifting and I set game difficulty to easy since I don t play racers I was about 93 percent and I got into race which was unmarked on map It was 6 circuit race against boss and that was final one SOME ADVICE FOR BEGINNGERS If you can t find races on map go to garage and check out world map option and you ll get list of all races per level If you beat them and can t find any more races upgrade your car or get some stars on visual rating by getting cosmetics new parts like spoilers lights new paint and you ll get an offer for magazine cover or DVD If you are still stuck cruise the town to find unmarked races 
Great Game This is one of the best racing games I have ever played You can do so many modifications to your car 
Need for Speed This game is a blast I am a female addicted to cars Being a girl we like to modify things like in sims such as paint and pick and choose so it is great for girls in this aspect But to be able to modify a car it is great in general Most of us dont have money to put all these mods on our vehicles so its great to just play around with the ideas As far as racing I had a blast I however did find it difficult to maneuver the cars in certain situations but eventually you get the hang of it This is a high addictive game I would recommend to any car lover

I like them They re nice cards I never had a problem Since I had 3 PS2s in my house at the time we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine then my boyfriend bought me these and I always had my own memory cards no one else could say they were theirs or anything else The only problem I can think of is that they are a little expensive 
My daughter loves it My 9 year old daughter loves PS2 so buying the cards were worth the cost 
Memory Cards As you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same 
Jesus Christ this is a fantastic game In the days where people play games to shoot random people and other stuff It s nice to know there s still art in videogames I loved this game My brother heard about it and I rented it soon after Wow Graphics 10 10 Lovely LOVELY BEAUTIFUL Enough said Sound 20 10 Music is so pretty I love the orchestral going on Story 7 10 The average Save the princess game Controls 8 10 Hard to deal with the horse Easy when walking Overall 9 10 This is a beautiful game but it s upsetting it s so short I can easily say this game introduced me into full on puzzle games It does have something to do with Ico but no one really knows if it s a prequel a sequel or anything 
Time well spent I have played this game up through the 6th Colossus The game just keeps drawing me in I want to see the next colossus find out what happens next As other reviewers have said these colossi are ENOURMOUS Finding out how to kill them can be a challange but the game will give you hints if you get stuck I can t say it s a terribly difficult game but for me spending TONS of time to figure out how to advance in a game is a turn off Definately worth buying 
Great Unusual Game I ve played lots of different genres of games and this one is difficult to classify other than it s a great game Most games cycle through my library but this one s a keeper The control is simple and natural the gameplay is hypnotizing and the music is perfect Hopefully there s a Shadow of the Colossus 2 in the works 
Shadow of the Colossus I rarely rate or write reviews about video games CDs or movies but I feel that this game deserves all the props it can get Honestly when I first saw an ad for it I thought it looked interesting but none of my friends or family had heard of it so I was reluctant to buy at first However my roomate and I decided to buy this game and play it through together and it ended up being even better than my favorite Final Fantasy video game series SotC has a unique story line decent music but most of all the most beautiful and innovative gameplay I have encountered The idea of just fighting giant creatures throughout a free roaming world is amazing being able to climb up them and use the terrain to the best of your advantage Having no trash mobs between each colossus was a relief too because I feel as though it would have made the game more cliche and unenjoyable I could talk all day about this but for the sake of listening to me rant go buy this gam 
Good Game Disappointing Climax Okay I ll have to start by saying that I don t play many Role Playing computer games I m a fan of the genre but I tend to play strategy command and conquer style games So when I picked this one up I didn t have a lot to compare my experience to I was immediately sucked into the game and the controls WERE NOT hard to learn despite what another review said Character progression is cool giving a fair bit of control over how you develop both skillwise and alignmentwise do you want to be good or evil It s your choice and effects how the game plays out The optional quests and main story quests are all cool but I have to warn you all the final battle is WAY TOO EASY I beat the whole game without maxing most of skills without having most of the really cool legendary weapons and without doing a lot of side quests But you can continue in the game world after it ends just let the credits roll for aprox 10 minutes Though there are no new quests you can run around and tie up loose ends like opening Demon Doors and Silver Key Chests 
Fun but too buggy Okay the game very fun the different powers were easy to use and I like the Morrowind esque game mechanics This feels like a smaller scaled down version of Morrowind honest The graphics are nice and the engine is not a hog you can run them at fairly high res even on the clunker that I m playing on So what s the problem The freezes I reckon it happens about every twenty minutes while playing Without being able to save when you re on a quest it becomes annoying I don t have any sound card issues any fancy visual themes running like windows blinds bottomline these freezes should not be happening yet they are This should already have been solved by now but there are no patches or updates for the game That was arrogant of the game designers to presume that they would not encounter any problems that they would have to patch post release There s not even an option on the menu of the game to search for updates The freezes cripple the playability of the game so overall it s not worth paying for and playing in my opinion 
Not sure 5 or 3 stars Good Gameplay overall the combinations of enemies vs weapons spells is well done You can buy every weapon go back to easier parts and see how each weapon fights You have light heavy short long with different damage You also have the option of using different spells This is for those like me who want to prolong the game I can t block roll physically disabled so I go the best defense is a good offense strategy You have many options how to win = you can thus make the game more difficult or easy based on your decisions Weapons many choices Light Heavy Short Long low damage high damage Augmentstions etc You can try differnet weapons out per whatever part of the game if you want to proplong the the adventure Some weapons just plain look cool Spells well I have my favorites but tried them all Some work much better than others vs certain enemies You can pick and choose I believe you can beat the game with only 3 but I used my favorite 6 = to spice things up Story well thought out Battles many major fights XP Gem runs I can think of 3 spots where you can increase these important categories Nice when added to a game Bugs only a few desktop crashes XP SP2 All in all you are not overwhelmed with too many options Just get in there and fight Bad Voiceovers sounded like 1 2 people did all the voices Women Villagers basically the same model Romance well one giggles and talk the other actually seems to enjoy you The third option for a wife is a special NPC and seems to be reading from a poor romance novel Ok you can hit the ESC button If they wanted to go down this path the designers should have put more variety work into this option Why no romance with Whisper would have fit the story + changed the same ness Why no romamce with Briar Rose as as above Why no romance with a Bordello lady same as above Wouldn t fit with the story but changed the same ness If you decide to give them a refuge shouldn t the ladies talk to you be open to romance They just stood there and posed Why can t I buy clothes for my wives could buy a dress for myself Maps I liked the trek from the Guild to Oakvale much to do and fight I would go back and forth several times Hoped to run into Nymphs Seems once you get to Knothole Glade you really don t feel the need to go roaming and look for something to fight do Ok you have the Arena lots of fun here = unless you hero save you do it once Hook Coast just part path of the final showdown Snowspire well it s it if you do the last soul What was the point of talking to villagers getting married etc you spent no time in these places There could have been a cave or forrest or swamp or a combination to give one something to do while in these villages Seems the final 1 3 of the game is just rushed upon you you feel like might as well and just keep questing and get this over with I would have liked to slow down wander around etc If you didn t have the equipment spells by now you won t get them by coming to Hook Coast Snowspire All I can remember of value would be some xp or boosting potions If they were just quest driven locals then only the map would be needed = I saw no reason to get a wife buy anything at this point Hero Save ok if you want to do xp key runs I ve heard of crashing problems if you over do it But in those longer tougher quests do you really want to redo several hours if you die or want to stop I m on my 6th replay = about 240hrs So I obviously like this game Just I see room for improvement by adding or subtracting = taking the middle I feel the designers weakend the overall experience BTW Fable 2 is in the works for Xbox = I hope they don t go crazy with the system requirements once it comes to the PC Afterall how much better does a game have to look = Fable TLC is easy on the eyes I found myself just wandering and looking on the first few plays 
I want more This is a fun game I rarely play games last two I really played was Dungeon keeper and Final Fantasy 7 Very enjoyable really not at all difficult if you have a pulse and the story was really cool My gripes are it was too easy evil mode is rather boring you age and everyone else does not too short Too short is the major gripe The only difficult part is the prison sequence which was also the best drama of the story in my opinion I actually got angry and then saddend by the events They need to make a sequal which is much longer actually has a point in evil mode and gives some simbalance of in game time with character age Buy it anywa 
great communicator this communicator is the best i have ever used i own a game center and play video games for extended amounts of time it remains comfortable tha phoeni 
Best Headset Headset is awesome Fits very snug on your ear and does not irritate over time Has crystal clear 2 4ghz channel 9 Hours of game time and only takes at the most 1 5 hours to charge Gaming is a lot more fun 
Really Great Really nice headset except for the fact that if your a gamer that spends alot of time on Xbox Live with this headset on it can start to hurt a little bit You can adjust the volume from barely being able to hear the person or basically to making it seem like they are yelling Very small and it does plug into the charger very well if someone says that they have to hold it in with a rubber band or tape then they messed it up somehow because the headset stays in nice and firm This is a MUST for people that cannot stand a cord getting in their way for their headset on xbox live or XB Connect Xlink It has VERY good range i can walk outside with the door closed about 50 or so steps away and i still get reception Overall if you have a Xbox and want to talk to other people online get this headset it is very nice 
Good Deal for the money I ve had this headset for about a month and a half and so far things have been working good It is a little staticky but for the price of 25 bucks you cant really go wrong If it comes down to a little static or being restricted by a lame cord then I d rather endure a little static The battery life is probaly a little over 4 hrs which is pretty good for the size of the unit The miscomfort that the other reviewers wrote about isnt really as bad as they ve made it sound Once again it is a LITTLE unconfortable for a long length of time 3 hrs + or maybe a little less for others but I dont think I ve worn any kind of ear piece that was very comfortable regardless of what it was designed for cell phone xbox ect One thing to keep in mind before you purchase manufacture is Logitech so I felt good about the reliability of the product Tacoma W 
A solid continuation from vice city until GTA 4 comes out This game is way more like vice city than san andreas so anyone expecting to see a character who has to eat go to the gym and etc will be disappointed San Andreas was a revolution in the history of all gaming this is a solid game too but minus the revolution You get all the fun of vice city basically which means cop bribing law breaking pedestrian harming havoc The sad fact is you can not climb swim or fly and there is no jetpack D oh The graphics are poor and the storyline is not as good as I would hope but remember this is a psp port It is also only 20 bucks so give it a try if you liked vice city a lot then you will like this one 
Lots of fun Square Enix is the best rpg developer on the planet Valkyrie is as much fun as ffs 1 10 graphics sound control and fun are all present in Valkyrie Profile 2 I highly recommend this title 
A Good Follow Up to a Fantastic Game Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic No matter how you look at it It was one of those games you either loved or hated Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square Enix to re release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2 The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original Despite what it looks like Valkyrie Profile 2 Silmeria is not a sequel to Valkyrie Profile but a prequel This means if you ve never played the first one fear not you aren t missing anything The story centers on Silmeria She s a Valkyrie trapped in the body of Princess Alicia Because of this it seems like Alicia has a split personality and that she s got to be crazy or something As a result Alice doesn t have very many friends if any at all Silmeria has been exiled by Odin the leader of the Gods She now wants revenge for what he has done to her and since Alice has no friends she agrees to help It s an interesting story but much like the first one gets off to a really slow start and takes a while to pick up The game s story is told through beautiful cinematics Not quite the best looking game on the PS2 but beautiful enough The backgrounds characters and monsters are all detailed Especially in some of the games cutscenes The voice acting is also suitable enough for the game The game also sounds really good The good news about Valkyrie Profile 2 is that there is no time limit Fans of the first will remember that there was a time limit before the battle at the end of the game Valkyrie Profile 2 does away with that and thank goodness it does This gives you far more time to explore and do everything the game has to offer and the dungeons are quite interesting Most Dungeons are pretty simple It sort of plays out in an action adventure style You have photons you can fire at your enemies and certain objects Your photon also reflects off some objects and it s actually vital to use this in some dungeons So the photon isn t just there it s essential Even more interesting in Valkyrie Profile is the battle system Battles are contact based In battle you ve got your characters on one side and your enemies on the other At first it seems like battles take place in real time but in reality the enemy only moves when you move This gives you more than enough time to plan out a strategy Each enemy has an attack zone If you re in it you ll be attacked In most RPGs getting attacked is no big deal In Valkyrie Profile 2 it s much more than just a big deal The difficulty of this game escalates really fast You ll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by some of your enemies Luckily there is a solution Most battles have a leader If you defeat the leader you win automatically without having to worry about defeating the others It helps if you want to end the battle quickly and especially helps when your party is being decimated Still the battle system calls for complete strategy on your part They say it takes about 40 hours to complete Valkyrie Profile 2 However you ll find yourself spending most of these hours leveling up to take on new challenges As I mentioned the difficulty level rises fast Meaning you ll probably do a lot of battling in a dungeon before moving on to the next Even worse you ll have to backtrack out of a dungeon once you complete it Even worse than that enemies respawn when you reenter a room The good thing about this at least is that the dungeons aren t overly long Again however you ll spend quite some time leveling up In addition to inside battle outside battle is just as interesting in dungeons You ll often come across sealstones When you pick them up they grant enhancements to your party They can be either positive or negative For example your strength could go up by grabbing one and go down by grabbing another Carrying it puts the effect on your party However you can also put the effect on your enemies by setting the stone on a dais Needless to say you ll want to put the negative effects on your enemies unless you re looking for a harder challenge than the game already is Outside of dungeons and battles you can learn plenty of skills throughout the game When you buy equipment you can link it together to give your characters special skills This is a lot of fun to play around with Although it should be said it gets tedious to set it up after a while The game shows you which skills you ve created through your equipment but there s no way for it to auto equip with the stuff that gives you that skill At first this is no problem but then as your characters start to build up and your list gets longer it becomes a pain to set up all these skills again It comes down to way too much time in the menu when there shouldn t have to be Valkyrie Profile 2 is overall a pretty satisfying game If you can get past the sluggish story which really does turn out to be really good in the end then you ll find yourself in love with this game It s different from the first one but not so much that old fans will find themselves disappointed Actually it s quite the opposite If you liked the first game then by all means pick up this one The Good +An interesting story +Beautiful graphics +Excellent music score +Good voice acting +Large cast of playable characters +Interesting skill system +Just all out fun to play The Bad The story is slow Really steep difficulty level a lot of the game will no doubt come from you spending time leveling up in dungeons before moving on The skill system is interesting but not being able to have your equipment auto equip is really annoying when you ve got a lot of characters and a lot of items in your inventory equipping your characters shouldn t be a tedious chor 
A MUST Play for RPG fans PS2 is far from dead Square Enix has done it again First off I am going to say I love this game I m a big turn based stategy RPG fan But I would say this gamefs battle system is semi real time with strategy elements and I love it I would have to compare the battle system to the likes of Parasite eve and Vagrant Story With the same elements still present from the original Valkyrie Profile This is probably the best RPG I have played all year I strongly recommend this game to any RPG fan and will definitely satisfy until FFXII Now for the review Graphics 5 out 0f 5 Simply amazing I knew the old PS2 still had it in her This game has some of the best graphics you are going to see on the PS2 you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it The detail in the characters background and dungeons are amazing I really get taken back to Vagrant story when I play this game And OMG the special attacks look ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Perform a special attack and your jaw will drop I canft say anything negative about the graphics in this game what so ever especially being last generation Sound 4 5 out 5 The game sounds great The voice over are well done Battle cries are wonderful and will take you back to the original Valkyrie Profile unless of course you purchased it on the PSP then it wont take you back very farcLOL Controls 5 out of 5 Okay I donft thing I have played an RPG with better controls You play on a 2D screen side scrolling with outward and inward exits and entrances press up or down accordingly to access them Anyone who has played the first one knows exactly how it works The first new thing you will notice is the new battle control scheme The old is you still have to press X O or to correspond to the character you have assigned to that button still works great The new is that now you are able to roam in 3D once you are in battle mode and this works great I explain in the Gameplay section L2 lets you find and switch targets and then you just analog to get there Gameplay 5 out of 5 Dare I say umm perfect First I will address the two things I loved about the original Valkyrie Profile that you will find in this sequel prequel 1st thing I began to get really annoyed by RPGfs now a days that make you have to talk to nearly every single person in a town to move the story along This is never a worry in the Valkyrie Profile series You go to a town if there is something of importance there CG or AI takes over all you have to do is listen read and then go shopping or if you really want talk to the limited amount of people in that town but it is normally just random talk nothing of real importance to the story Or you may have to talk to some people to fnd side quest maybe Many of the RPGfs I have tried to play lately suffered from thiscI mean who has the time to sit and play a game for hours only to be left feeling like you barely accomplished anything cause you couldnft find the right person to move the story along 2nd thing is the battle system being able to press a certain button numerous times and watch that character spring in to action was always a joy Lets you feel more involved in battle instead of just letting you sitting and watching The new additions are GREAT additionscfirst the free roaming in battle You can move anywhere on the 3D battle screen you want within the parameters of course Since you are able move anywhere on the battle screen Square Enix thought it would be a good idea to allow you to split up your party and they were right Basically you have a party of 4 but you can split them up into 2 teams Imagine this if you willcyou send one team to either fight a separate group of enemies or you can send one group to draw attention and use the other group to attack from behind taking the enemy by surprise and normally causing more damage Strategy has been added Other notable mentions Special attacks are Stellar Enemy Bosses are huge and characters are very likable Also while in a dungeon you can still turn foes to crystal and use them to aide you in reaching different areas but dig this Now you can turn a foe to crystal then shoot that foe a second time to transport yourself to its position Ex You see an enemy on the ledge in front above you but you cannot reach him or the ledge by simply jumping So you shoot diagonally at him freeze him shoot a second time and you are immediately transported to his position on the ledge and he is transported to your old position How cool is that Story So Far 4 out of 5 the story so far is great and from what I can tell takes place before the original Valkyrie Profile I am only about 40 in to it but so far I am really drawn in to it I cant go in to more detail for the sake of spoiling it but it is intriguing Bottom Line If you are an RPG fan you MUST have this title in your library of games it will not disappoint With the combination of the GREAT original gameplay stellar graphics intriguing story and innovative new features this is one not to be missed Even if you are not an RPG fan I would still recommend this as a rental 
A good follow up to the original I have now played VP2 for a few days now and I have to say that I like it It has its problems but overall it is a very fun game VP2 takes place 100 or so years before the original VP I won t spoil any of the plot except to say that many of the ruins visited in the original game appear as beautiful cities in VP2 and one gets the sense that we will see why these cities became ruins in the course of the game Graphically the game is beautiful The movies are nice if stiff at times and the sound is great Mechanically however there are some issues VP2 attempts to keep the essence of the battle system from the original intact while adding a 3 D wrinkle Unfortunately the controls are so gummy at times that you will be frustrated as often as you are pleased by the results of the new system All in all though the game is excellent I drop it a star because of control issues 
Lives up to the original and pretty to boot Beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the Valkyrie Epic The storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists Valkyrie Profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the PS2 making it a must buy On a personal note this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so I highly recommend playing VP1 through before starting VP2 
Decent but not Fantastic The art is quite simply the most amazing part of this game However the story is thin and the gameplay can be repetitive I beat it in less than 12 hours and I did every sidequest 
Best Game Ever This is the best game made for the Xbox Well worth the money 
Fate may have placed us as foes but this ring will make us brothers As I finished the original Halo game for the X Box I found myself completely unimpressed With as much hype this game found upon its release I thought that it could have had more depth to it The characters story fight sequences and weaponry all seemed stale Once you passed the first level you pretty much saw everything there could be to see with the game It became repetitive over time with an ending that left you feverish for more It did not deserve the cult like status that it received Hesitantly I began playing the sequel in hopes that I could continue to trash this series as being nothing more than premature over hype by fanboys that didn t grow up in the Goldeneye generation Outstandingly this sequel impressed me Let me state that again this sequel was by far at least 100 better than the original so much in fact that I found myself asking why this wasn t the first in the series It drew me in for continuous play with engaging characters an extremely strong story and voices that made you proud to be fighting as either Master Chief or one of the downtrodden Covenant Halo 2 takes huge steps forward from nearly every facet of the original After playing Halo 2 the original seems like a modified version of Pong To begin with the weaponry is outstanding One of the major complaints that I had with the original was that the arsenal of weapons seemed minimal at best leaving a whole world of new weapons unopened Well in this game these worlds were opened and fully explored There were so many new and detailed weapons in this game I had trouble finding my favorite Thankfully the team at Bungie understood that I couldn t pick just one and finally encouraged Master Chief to use two weapons at once That s right boys we can double fist the Needler like it is going out of business This small change created so much more enjoyment for me because I could really wreak havoc from around the corner and there was plenty of havoc to reek This sequel not just gave you a game where you could sit back and create the explosions at any given time but also developed a structured story with amazing cut sequences that transformed the world of Halo into more than just a one dimensional game While Halo 2 boasts a shorter play time what appealed to me was the depth of the characters and the spectrum of what was happening to Earth during this apparent war In the original game I felt that my sole purpose was to destroy destroy destroy without any questions or answers That is not the case here where the missions seem intense the purpose is forthright and the unknown lurks deeper than imagined There were places we traveled in this game that I didn t think existed on the Halo playing field In my eyes Bungie took a small somewhat simple game and grew the playing field immensely The detail focused on the graphics were intense the introduction to this supernatural world was exciting and the deception of evil made me push further more than I did in the original This sequel was a game that you could turn the volume up on your surround system and fully enjoy the explosions the swooping of incoming enemy ships as well as the appropriately placed voice moments For anyone that loves to hear the illustrious voice of David Cross yelling quips and quandaries at you as you destroy any Elite than this is the perfect game for you It just felt like more icing on an already sweet cake Weapons voices a compelling story this is exactly what I expected from the original game but alas did not see it If this was the original release of the game than I would see the hype surrounding it Halo 2 was nearly flawless with the clear images the veracity of the A I as well as the compelling and detailed storyline Why couldn t you steal a vehicle from the enemy in the original I experienced enjoyment with this game as I made it to the next level unlike in the original where I knew that it was just going to be a similar fight with aged weapons This sequel compelled me to move forward into a deeper unknown But again it wasn t perfect While I will attest to everyone that Halo 2 was a million times better than the pathetic original there were still some small issues that need to be addressed The ending was horrid For a person that does not have nor does he plan to get at this time the infamous 360 I will be left with an open ended ending that really questions your loyalty to the finale The same issue happened with the first game with so much dedication and integrity to the meat of the game why not dedicate a spectacular ending The choice of armor for Master Chief seemed weaker than the original I dare not run into a fight this time but instead had to make me think about my attacks A bit annoying when you wanted to just run a suicide mission I also hated the fact that you could not throw grenades when you were dual wielding your weapons Master Chief is a strong man machine I strongly believe that he could do both which put me into some tougher situations sometimes Finally why was there a timed limit for the Arbiter to remain cloaked These may seem like small things to the big gamer but for me they could have been strengthened to create a tighter game Overall I cannot speak higher of this sequel For those that yell that the original is always better than any sequels then I would have to say Halo 2 is the exception Bungie took the opportunity to grow this empire and give us a view of this war from a dual angle making the universal terror greater and more relevant I enjoyed this game from the beginning to the struggled ending with all the excitement and enjoyment that I was hoping for with the original I highly suggest this game to those that were unimpressed with the first and do somewhat look forward to what the trilogy will encounter if we can get it without the 360 Grade out of 
A boomer loves it I m a 40 something guy and can t recall how many multi hour sessions were spent playing this game Simply lots of fun and I enjoy thoroughly the story line The Flood freak me out 
the best shooting game ever i love this game i have bought this game 3 times 
Great game but bad product Though I admit this game title is old that does not mean the product should be damaged 1 of the discs were probably damaged in storage and the game system is having trouble reading the disc This was my second attempt at getting the game the first time all the discs were broken so I returned them But this time only 1 was broken and I found that out too late Final Fantasy VIII is a great game but if only the discs were not broken 
Great Game I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok 
A Fantasy Unlike Any Other When I think of an entire series such as Final Fantasy this game always seems to be the odd one out FFVIII does not take the medieval or archaic look that others in the series do I hardly agree with the gamers who do not see the potential this game has FF8 takes on a lot of unique elements that are more noticeable than other FF games One of the elements is the very unusual storyline In my opinion the storyline is rather impressive Though it overshadows on the blossoming love of the 2 main characters there is not a lot of predictability in the storyline No hidden characters and no actual villain remains the same throughout the game Another element is the gameplay Characters being able to draw and distribute elements is a little more refreshing to use than the Materia and Junction systems from previous FFs Graphics in Final Fantasy 8 are very exquisite The cutscenes are enough to illustrate the game without drawing away from the gameplay I especially enjoy the soundtrack to the game I mix all the video game music on my Ipod and often am confused about which game it comes from FF8 has a distinguished composition that makes it stand out from other video games As a lot of gamers know FF8 takes the series in a direction that other games did not take The lack of mini games is definitely an issue While Triple Triad is fun and addictive to take on it is a hassle to reload or restart the game if you lose valuable cards Also trading some of these valuable cards for items is a hassle too I found myself in desperate need of Invincibles for use as defense against the final boss The Guardian Forces almost forgot about them are exciting to acquire too Spending numerous time on sidequests should not be a requirement to beat the game though Also FF8 spends little interest in developing secondary characters but I do have to praise the excellence in overall dialogue writing Give FF8 a shot as a favor to yourself for the gamers who feel like it is a definite miss 
A great game for people who want something a little different I still remember getting this game on 9 9 99 the day it came out I love this game because of it s junction system and some of the other cool features in this game Unfortunatly from all of the people that I knew people either hated the game most of those people are on this side of the love hate group and a few people loved it Extremly Hardcore RPG fans seem to love it I love the game but this is the Final Fantasy game that a whole lot of people just can t stand It is a long game especially if you get stuck so a guide internet or actual guide i don t care will really help It is the easiest game to literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you a level up but using the junction system is also an important role in the game because it can raise your stats as well This is a game that you will have to play for yourself before you agree with the haters give it a spin please 
Nothing Like It Before Or Since Then Okay so there are tons of reviews on FFVIII with intense hatred and love on both ends of the spectrum So what to do if your indesicive about purchasing this game Here are some simple facts Whether or not you enjoy this game will hinge on the fact that you A Like Squall Leonhart B Enjoy sci fi based RPG as opposed to strict High Fantasy and finally C Have the patience to understand the Draw Junction system I loved this game very much because all three points were never an issue with me There were some weaknesses of the game but most just come from scripting and plot The primary one being a Lone Wolf Introvert leading an entire team of high spirited extroverts That would drive anyone up the wall though I think many people didn t like Squall because they knew someone like him in real life The only other real plot weakness is that the major big bad villans Edea Adel and Ultimecia seem to take a complete backseat to all of Squall s personal problems getting to know Rinoa learning more about his family I d rather have more of a balance between the two plot forces but that s about it The Draw Junction system which powers up the PC s requires a lot more thought than the other systems that FF is used to but if you can remember what stats are used for like Vit for defense and Spr for Magic Defense it will go a lot smoother If you like RPG s like Xenosaga or Phantasy Star or even Knights of the Old Republic then by all means get this in your collection just keep in mind the points I made before 
A Gem I have all the Final Fantasy Games except for VIII I just never got around to getting it I purchased VIII two months ago and I have currently beat it I though it was well worth playing The storyline was great Each charcter brought something spectacular to the game I never put it down The ending alone was worth it 10 of 10 for the best story and gfs Trinity 
One of the Best Video Games Ever Made Katamari Damacy is one of the best games ever made It s also the freshest game Don t let the kiddie theme deter you this is extremely playable for anyone The music has very good genre recordings some of them are accoustic jazz studio recordings in Japanese but the jazz sound is there especially in Gin Tonic Red Red Roses which is a noir ish 15 minute scat vocal swing track with percussion piano double bass and flute The game has a two player mode which is set in an arena as a competition to see who s better The one player mode is the story driven mode about the King of the Cosmos father of your protagonist who is a little green guy that looks similar to a Teletubby The objective is to use the two analog sticks to make the character push around a small ball inside a garden or the rooms in a house or both into objects normally found in those three dimensional environments such as pairs of scissors mice golf balls flowers paperclips dining chairs spoons anything and everything The rolling of the ball has a snowball effect which means the more things your character rolls up into the ball the larger the ball becomes There s a big transition moment in the game where after rolling the ball around the rooms of a house the character breaks out of the house down the driveway to a farmer s market on the other side of the street where he starts rolling in watermelons until the ball gets even larger and rolls in bicycles little kids and then adults The game play is a surreal fantasy but it all comes together in its finale with an abstract epiphany that the world is a small enough place to understand each other when replacing the unnecessary with the meaningful The more I played this game the hungrier I got and the ending surprised me with an epiphany It s by Namco who as you know is the Japanese company that produced the original Pac Man arcade game Since then it has produced several genre games for Sony s Playstation including the Soul Edge series Soul Blade and Soul Calibur the Tekken series the Ridge Racer Rage Racer series and the Ace Combat Air Combat series all of which has been prime landmarks in that console s history This game is so fresh it struck a blow to me Strangely it is one of those Japanese releases that almost didn t make it over to America When it was brand new its list price was only 20 most games are 50 upon release The raving critical success and the sleeper hit popularity of this game garnered a sequel but I haven t played it yet At any rate it just may continue on as one of Namco s great series if it maintains the inertia of this original one 
Very Fun What can you say for Katamari Damcy except for it s exciting original fun edgy I totally recommend this for any video game fan that love games on the edge of something different new P S Don t delete this game when you are done because you will need to convert your progress to We Love Katamari 
Fun Game But Some Parts Take Too Long This is a pretty cool game that kills off the lonely boring hours of my life but I feel that some of the levels have too long of a time limit Not that I can finish them that quickly but I think they should be designed to be shorter levels For instance I think the Make the Moon level gives you 25 minutes to complete it Well that s just great if I have 25 minutes to kill but that s quite a bit of time to just sit down and space out the world while I roll junk up into a ball So like 10 tries on that level kills off 4 hours of my life which gets me closer to my sweet sweet death but sometimes I like to have my playtimes in shorter fixes For those times I play Zuma but I wish I could play a shorter version of Katamari 
good times Well i first played this game at my friends house and thought it was quite adddicting even though my friend had hated it When i started to play it shows you how to get started and is very simple for just about anyone who knows how to read i put this game up right beside kingdom hearts 2 for its gameplay not the graphhics it also has a great soundtrack 5 thumbs up eat your cheesemuffins everyday = 
Almost as weird as a Japanese Vending Machine Specifically recommended by X Play on TV ABSOLUTELY agree that the recommendation was good I rolled my eyes at my wife when she wanted to spend 19 bucks on this game and I think I actually called it totally retarded She let me play it first and within 3 minutes I was hooked She s not allowed to play it because it s MINE ALL MINE Yes I m 29 years old and she STILL can t have it I d recommend this game to anyone NOT looking for an advanced game requiring weeks of play and advanced storyline If you like Tetris but want a little more variety and just a little more skill requirement and a good laugh this game is for you There s something oddly satisfying by rolling over the dog and seeing his legs twitter in the air when 5 minutes earlier he was pushing you around WEIRD Yes FUN Yes I d say good for 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won t appreciate how strange and cool this game really is 
Absolutely Wonderful Experience Katamari Damacy is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale gaming world It is a title you will likely never get tired of and it s odd but simple gameplay draws you back again and again The music in the background is especially catchy and fun to listen to and makes me smile whenever I hear it The entire game experience is not unlike the pleasant feelings you experience after hours of prolonged zen meditation and I would recommend the game to anyone looking for something new The game s only flaw is that it is a little short I wish it were twice or three times as long as it is 
awesome game Don t listen to the other reviewers This game is great By far beats out Sim city 4 and I have that game It s challenging to make everybody happy but if the game was easy it wouldn t be fun 
Starforce This game is great it definitely beats out SimCity4 in almost every department Graphics are nice the social subcultures are nice and the game is great overall I only miss the region overview but I m pretty sure if they copied THAT many elements then EA would have had pretty good grounds for a lawsuit cease and desist order Now onto the reason I rated this game a one overall I just paid the price of a full game so I could have Starforce installed on my computer Just the other day I was deleting Starforce because it came on another game of mine This form of copy protection is nothing short of malware and I ve already had one dual layer lightscribe DVD drive reduced to a worthless piece of scrap metal thanks to it I m getting tired of having to find cracks for Starforce games I buy legally just to avoid severe hardware damage To the point where I ve decided that I m not going to buy Starforce protected products anymore 
City Life Sim City 4 But Better I had saw an ad for City Life and I clicked it I read about it and thought it sounded so much better than Sim City 4 which I currently own that I decided to download and try the demo The demo was so much fun and it had many features What gives this game a unique twist is the social cliques You have to meet the needs of each cliques for example the different types of jobs they need What makes it realistic is it is just like real life The blue collars dont want to live next to the fringes whereas the rich don t want to live next to the poor or homeless What supprised me the most about this game though was the 3d graphics You can zoom in and out and get eye level with the people You can see them reading the paper on their picnic table in their backyard or walking down the street or taking the trash out Another neat feature is how easy it is to zone The zoning is such an improvement over SC4 This game makes you auctually have to get involved with your community making it your perfect town Now all I am waiting for is my copy of the game to come in 1 least 10 best Graphics 8 Simplicity 9 Fun 10 Realistic 9 Overall a great game for those who are tired of waiting for SC5 or for those who are just starting out with city simulation games 
Eye Toy is the Kix of video games There used to be a cereal called Kix that had a jingle Kids like Kix for what Kix has got Mom s like Kix for what Kix is not Eye Toy with Play2 is the Kix of video games I am the parent of a six year old girl Like many parents I was worried about getting a video game system for my daughter given the prevalent headlines about kids not getting enough exercise Then I saw Eye Toy advertised and I thought it could serve as a means to keep my daugther active but still allow her to participate in video game activities which kids love I bought Eye Toy with the Play 2 video game and I couldn t be happier with the results My daughter loves the games They are very inventive and if you ve seen the advertising you already realize that the Eye Toy camera puts the player s image right in the middle of the action The system doesn t work perfectly but close enough to simiulate activities from cooking to kung fu The game format also allows for fun head to head competition which is great for kids parties etc The best part is my daughter works up a real sweat when she plays the games The games have her jumping diving dancing punching and kicking She gets great exercise and has a lot more fun than if she was just sitting there The games aren t just for young kids either Kids up to young teen age years seem to enjoy them too For that matter I enjoy them but I m not worried about appearing cool We also bought my daughter the Sega Superstars disc for Eye Toy Those games are geared for older children but there are a couple which my daughter loves too Overall I couldn t be happier with how this experiment turned out I really hope more people become aware of Eye Toy s benefits because I think they are a great solution to a vexing problem Maybe Eye Toy should buy that old Kix gingle P S One thing the Eye Toy should come with is a lamp Buy one of your own we use a desk lamp with flexible neck to make sure the area the player is in is very well lit If not the camera has a difficult time seeing the player and the results aren t as good 
Great fun for me and my kids I got this for my 8 year old son He had a blast moving jumping waving his hands playing the game My 4 year old daughter easily picked up the games too Bubble Pop is her favorite I love the Anti grav demo game and intend on getting the actual game later on It is amazing technology at work This is not a passive PS2 game at all and you can break a sweat while playing That s what I call fun We can even make funny videos of ourselves and see ourselves perform on TV That is cool 
great video game this video game was recommended to me by my 19 yr old son for my 7 yr old son it is a great hit my 7 yr old loves it and my other sons ages 19 and 22 enjoy it also very entertaining well worth the money 
MUCH better than the first Eye Toy Play 2 is much better than the first While the first had limits on what you could actually do this one has very few There is a much larger variety of games and different activities Such as running during a baseball game dodging searchlights while collecting items chopping pickles and smashing tomatoes defeating a three headed hydra and so much more During multiplayer mode you get to take a picture of your face which is then placed in the head of a robot monkey which is a hilarious touch Also during multi player mode when a tie occurs the players get to do a tie breaker in the form of a fun little mini game The downside to this is that if you want to play the minigames at anytime you have to force a tie which can be a pain Downsides to Eye Toy Play 2 Some of the games are more frustrating than challenging and the instrutions in the booklet aren t very clear Like most Eye Toy games you have to turn on all the lights nearby and open the curtains to get decent enough lighting Even when the camera is set to Dim Room The video messaging is terrible You don t get to choose a background like in the original Eye Toy and the image is small and distorted The Playroom is difficult to find and there is a limited ammount of games some of which make no sense Like when it asks you to put a brightly coloured image in front of the camera It s just weird Overall Eye Toy Play 2 is completely worth the buy It s hours of endless fun and the games never seem to get old 
Great Game This is a great game However I can only play it at a friend s house Even though I pre ordered it from Toys R Us in July it somehow is not getting shipped to me until November I wish I could play it at my own home 
Run Don t Walk This game did what the prequels couldn t for me it drew me back into the Star Wars universe with a vengence I am not a real big gamer and really don t like console games but this game is a must have for any fan casual or hardcore Knights also comes in a PC version for those who don t have access to a console or like me don t really care for them In fact the PC version has more Mods available for it I believe so I would probably recommend it first Knights or Kotor as it is known in the fan community is set 4000 years before A New Hope It s the sweeping tale of a talented Padawan who comes late to the Force and holds the fate of the galaxy in their hands Since this is an RPG the best part is the Jedi is YOU What really drew me to this game was the well developed storyline and the flushed out characters The other members of you party have backstorys that play directly into the plot in the form of sidequests during the course of the game You almost feel like they are real and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to the party memebers as the story progressed Their responses are also influenced by your dialog choices and can even affect the main character s relationships with the other party members This is a Bioware game as well so there is the option to romance one of the other party members You can also choose which side of the Force to follow The player can either be the quintessential Light Jedi evil as Palpatine or somewhere inbetween Your choices throughout the game affect your alignment in the Force and also what powers are less exhausting to use The dialog is fantastic and rarely comes off as cheesy unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless and the voice actors who portray the other characters are wonderful Even the dialog for the main character has the option to be funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment The game gives you the choice to play as a male or female character which actually influences what side quests you can pick up as well as having a minor effect on the main story Personally I thought this was the most gratifying aspect of the game I got to play as a kickin female Jedi who holds the fate of the galaxy in her hands Due to this as well as the ability to choose your alignment there are four possible endings to this game Knights has been able to hold an excellent replay factor as well due to the number of Mods available for the game from other fans LucasArts actually encourages and even supports fan mad mods on thier website When you get bored with the main storyline there are mods out there that change everything from looks to clothes to Force Powers and even dialog There s even a Mod out there that restores the cut fifth ending that was only available as a female character The game mechanics are pretty easy to get a handle on The combat options give you the ability to either choose what attacks each character in your party use or leave them automated Those who aren t real familiar with computer games should be able to pick up the basics fairly fast Those who like first person shooters may find it a little frustrating as the attacks themselves are automated For me this was a plus as I m not a fan of button smashers A work of advice to someone who hasn t played the game or isn t familiar with it s storyline avoid searching on the internet for info on it as much as possible This may be frustrating if you are someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me the storyline s twist is not something you want to spoil You ll enjoy the game storyline much more if you don t spoil the surprise There are gaming sites where you can get cheats and only cheats if your a cheater like me Not only will teen players enjoy it but I know plenty of 20 and 30 somethings who adore this game It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Original Trilogy If you like Star Wars at all run don t walk and buy this game 
The Force is strong with this one After playing this game for 16 days I finally finished it after 91 hours of game play I now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards it is just that good Try not to breeze your way right through it though or you ll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience Take your time and enjoy it Not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy this game requires you to think befor you do things It really is a fun game to play And overall that s what playing games are all about having fun 
Forget the movies This game defines Star Wars greatness Story 10 10 Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic puts you in a world of complete bliss and utterly fantastic awe This is not just a shoot em up game for within the millions of pixelated characters lies a story A story with jaw dropping mind blowing twists and turns and conclusions awaiting Choose your path for the first time you can choose your own destiny rather than the creators This game is not just one plot nor is it a mindless adventure trekking the whereabouts of the middle of nowhere looking for purpose No this game is many a quests and riddles illusions and games inside to keep the gamers on their tippy toes at all times Starting out as a mysterious rebel who does not know his her own past fight or peacefully sneak your way through the depths of several planets each carrying many people with many stories You may help these people you may be there savior and deny a reward or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls to create your path to the dark side All the while making the venture across native lands toward beoming a Jedi encounter friends enounter foes and convert them to friends if you ever so wish It doesn t matter because in the end it s only you facing the evil sith lord toe to toe lightsaber to lightsaber Gameplay 9 10 The fighting system is somewhat random but not entirely you can choose to create a concrete combat fighter or a wizard casting spells such as lighting wind life draining lightsaber throwing etc Many different various skills such as stealth persuasion even computer hacking and lockpicking Sort of You can stay close using lightsabers one in each hand or a double bladed one Or you stray afar using blaster rifles and pistols You have many compainions droids jedis dark side mercenaries and wookies each with a charming dramatic or brutal life story which will only be concluded as the game furthers on Very impressive dialogue and screenwriting graphics and realism are also mediocre I can guarantee with the low 20 price this game will give you hours of fun each day for at least a month And trust me when that month is up you will not want to get rid of it you will get the urge to play it again because once you start this game you are hooked on a long term engagement The only thing I find wrong with this game is it s sequel Pros Excellent sound effects dialogue screenplay scenery designing and story writing Hundreds of weapons armor with belts gloves arm bands implants and masks to further increase skills Hundreds of side quests with extravagant rewards and conclusions that will keep you in awe all day long No wondering from world to world in search of plots they are usually easy to find but challenging not boring to accomplish No matter what you can always play the game a different way so you would be just beginning your quest as soon as you beat the game Neat little area from xbox live downloadable content which can open up another plot and give you VERY nice weapons and two new lightsaber colors Turquoise orange You can change the overall game difficulty it s default setting is medium Cons No type of multiplayer games in any circumstance It s surprising they didn t make a co operative option Sometimes annoying loading transitions can take maybe 10 15 seconds at most I d advise having some music handy if it s your 2nd or 3rd time through the game 
Choose your path I ve seen people love this game and hate this game either there not a star wars fan or they hate the battle system I myself love star wars and the battle sysetm in this game The battle system is simple yet fun at the same time You and however many party members you have attack then your enemy attacks At first you will hate it or think it s slow but as the game progresses you get many mmore attacks and defenses and will get more involved The music is Star Wars New and old music that everyone will love The story as someone said in their review is worthy of being the script of a film The story is what won this game awards It also completely changes weather you follow the dark or light The characters your with you come to love and you can talk to them whenever and they have a large wealth and background info to uncover The voice acting is also well put together and ingages you more down the path of realism I would overall rate this game a 9 7 out of 10 When adding the flaws and good side This would be on my top 3 games of all time Pros Engaging and very great story Great voice work Splended music Star Wars fans will fall in love Large explorable worlds Great combat many weapons and custamizable weapons Long story game ranges from 20 35 hours long It took me 26 my first time and my longest 33 depending on all the side missions you do Cons Graphics most of the time are fuzzy unless your playing it on 360 Very very very slow load times I have beat the game 12 times 5 dark 7 light and after you have played through the story on both sides at least twice 4 total it will get old after you know the story People say that it freezes often mine hasn t ever but the framerate has slowed down during a large battle Overall I hope my review was helpfull and I believe the game is 20 now and thats great for a game this good 
Ups the ante on Star Wars games One thing about KOTOR 2 that greatly impressed me is how Obsidian taking the KOTOR franchise over from BioWare did not mess with a winning formula They faithfully carried over the first game s visual style presentation and atmosphere which means those who played KOTOR 1 can jump right in Just like KOTOR 1 the game hinges on its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features KOTOR 2 s storyline runs parallel to KOTOR 1 s and introduces a new protagonist whose only tie to the first game is that he she fought in the Mandalorian Wars Again the characters can be a bit flat stereotypical and will do most of the talking throughout the game you mostly choose how you ll respond to others through your dialogue choices The main reason why I would actually rate this game higher yes higher than KOTOR 1 is the intelligence of the script What I mean by that is how the game s characters challenge you both the main character and the person playing the game to think long and hard about some things that are regarded as truths Yes I m talking some serious philosophy here For example Kreia one of your allies challenges you to think about how a random act of kindness actually robs the person that s being helped of the chance to struggle fight and become stronger for it And a Jedi Master will challenge you to think about what to do if a cause you believed in strongly ends up doing just as much harm as it prevents In another instance the game shows the dangers of both blind allegiance AND independent thought yes the latter also has dangers And the best part is that all of this is presented within the context of the game s various scenarios without ever sounding preachy As far as the gameplay mechanics are concerned Obsidian spiced up the battle interface with new Force powers and feats which open up a new dimension to strategizing and outfitting your party Unfortunately it seems all the bugs and glitches from the first game were carried over as well such as the doorway bug and the menu bug And playing Pazaak is still just as hard As a nod to those who played the first game Obsidian decided to insert many references to KOTOR 1 here and there For example KOTOR 2 recycles two planets from the first game Dantooine and Korriban The maps are identical to the ones from the first game but this time you explore slightly different parts of the planets And people in the game are constantly referring to the Mandalorian Wars the war that was fought five years before KOTOR 1 s timeline and the Jedi Civil War the events of KOTOR 1 In fact you ll find that the Jedi Civil War casts a very large shadow over the lives of many people you ll encounter in the game including most of your allies You ll find that having played the first game certainly enriches this one although it s not crucial So in summary if you re suffering from post KOTOR withdrawal symptoms your prayer has been answered go buy this game NOW 
Left me wishing for more There are three things that matter to me when I sit down to play a game 1 Playability 2 The Story and 3 Graphics This game excelled in all three The ease of directing my character about and choosing his moves were so prominent and felt so natural that I just sort of fell into my character s role As in few other RPG games I didn t doubt for a second what I was supposed to do to move forward The story of the game is deep and riveting but more importantly sensible This is not just another action game with annoying throw away characters and subplots that go nowhere You actually care about the characters involved and you take a keen interest in what their future holds even the characters that you only get to see for a moment The ending is especially well done for it left me thinking about where my character would go next what he would do what path he would follow Even though I made his decisions throughout the entire game he was still his own character I simply shaped him a bit When I finally put the controller down and watched the credits roll up the screen I was heartbroken that it was over But then I realized that I could simply start all over again with a completely different character and end up in a completely different place A whole new experience If you re anything like me trust me when I say that this game is one of a kind And last but certainly not the least the graphics are fantastic and at times breath taking The graphics only work to bring out the story and characters and make the universe that the game is set in all the more believable They never fail to set the tone for whatever setting you find yourself in As with its predecessor The Sith Lords raised the bar for role playing games Role playing games such as Final Fantasy while still enjoyable in their own right tend to allow the player almost no freedom at all Sith Lords allows an astounding amount of freedom You can literally go where you want do you what you want however you want to do it Granted it s not Grand Theft Auto but then GTA is not a role playing game But while I am quick to point out the great aspects of the game I most also point out the bad The first major annoyance is that the game continually froze and I was forced to reset the system and start over To counter this problem you ll be forced to save often and on different slots the game even warns you to do so It s not really a big deal but it did get to me a little The second major annoyance was my inability to control all the members of my party proficiently the AI continally got me into trouble I could have avoided This is one of the problems the first Knights of the Old Republic had Other than that there s nothing else worth mentioning As with its predecessor I hold this game in the highest esteem and eagerly look foward to the next if there is one installment Enjoy the game 
KOTOR II It s a fun game whether you are a star wars fan or not It has good story and good game play The game play is very much like the first There are a few problems when to select and object and your character gets stuck trying to run to it And the game becomes rather easy once you start getting into the higher levels Other than that it is a solid RPG 
aws good as the first one as i said about the first game kotor 2 is still one of the best rgp games for the xbox the bew story is close to episode 3 from the movies the jedi are in shamble and the sith are in power but you are the last of jedi so they thought you do find some familier faces from the first game like master vrook tmo4 revans battle droid bastila carth and thats about it only the droids are in your party though what is new about the game that you can influence your party members so you can bring them to the light or the dark but be warned if your going to get them on yopur side you have to do things they think is right some charitable acts will influence some but others will want to be brute force also you can influence them when your talking to them influenceing them does pay off by getting them to trust you more they will tell you things this will also bring more force points ect this one other then the first had that you can train some members of you party to becom jedi or sith depend on your path also the new classes have changed for the path of the light has 3 classes jedi master gives you better influence on you rparty members and have more force power and also can give party members stronger by using force points be advised it onlys last for a limited amount of time jedi weapons master lets you upgrade your 2 weapons fighting and upgrades on other fighting states the jedi watchmen is for the stealth types the sith marauder can enter afury inflicting more damage then before it almost like the jedi weapons master buy better the sith lord does just about the same but can weaken you foes by using force points i can t rember what the other one is but its the same as the jedi watchmen the sith lords are sheer amazing the one has cracks through all his body because he thrives on pain the other leeches on planets to feed his hunger for the force and the last one is a surprise well the game is great and the twists are perfect a must have like the other 
One of the best classics period Let me say that yes this game is too violent for kids but beyond that it is totally awesome The graphics are better than those found in San Andreas and I enjoy robbing the stores greatly You will also notice that your health and armor will decline more rapidly in this game than in SA Ok so it does not have three super detailed cities but it has one nearly perfect city Vice City is the perfect parody of 1980s Miami and the missions seem to be pretty reflective The storyline is about what you would expect but the voice over acting is exceptional for a videogame The two main characters Tommy and Lance sound better than the characters in most major motion pictures I started my adventures with GTA San Andreas but in fact I am enjoying this game even more For anyone who liked either GTA III or San Andreas pick this up and by the way avoid Lib City Stories it is just too dull after a while 
The GREATEST GTA installment This is my First introduction to the Wolrd of GTA and I Loved it I ve played GTA 3 but it was not as fun as Vice City due to the Voice Actors included in the game which gives the game life I wasn t a VERY big fan of American Music since I only listen to Japanese but this game made me like them bit by bit Even though it has some glitches in the game I still prefer this over ALL GTA series 
Ah the moonlight I feel romantic driving through the city in the rain with the moon in view Emotion on the dial I m ashamed to admit I spend most of my evenings helping the coppers chase down wannabe s in front of the mall 50 bucks a pop for a citizen s arrest and I just keep kicking em while they re down cha ching I ve bought all the properties with just the results of my do gooder vigilantism See this game rewards a higher sense of morality 
What you need to know about this game I loved this game It was well made and insanely broad in what you could do with it If you aren t phased by fantasy violence then you ll probably think the game is a lot of fun too But I will never let my children come within 10 feet of this game and you probably shouldnt either Here s why I fitting retitle of this game would be Scarface the Game because that s what a great deal of this game is modeled after an extremely violent movie about being a drug lord The game takes place in a realistic coastal city There are restaurants beaches hospitals hotels police depts grocery stores bars gas stations In fact the game was modeled after the locations and sights found in the movie Scarface The city is populated with pedestrians golfers shoppers people waiting to get on buses in cabs hookers gang members strippers drug dealers policemen emergency medical technicians bums store cashiers etc You can kill any one of these people You can solicit a prostitute and then run over her with your car as she gets out and leaves then take the money back that you paid her You can watch a strip show then shoot the stripper You can hack a pedestrian up with a chainsaw Throw a cab driver out of his cab then run him over with it You can perform drive by shootings You can start a gang war You can walk up to a car aim a rifle at an innocent driver and shoot them directly in the head and watch them fall out of the driver s seat You can drive around inside a shopping center and run over the shoppers You can distribute flyers for adult films that you re producing You can even start a massacre shooting then as the EMT s come to help people blow them up with a rocket launcher or simply beat them to death with a baseball bat You can become such a threat to the city that the National guard may appear with tanks helicopters and infantry Yes you can kill them too You don t have to do all this stuff In fact almost none of it is necessary in completing the main point of the game You simply have the freedom to do it if you desire to Or you could simply go through the basic missions of the game that involve an ex con s rise to power as a leader of a powerful mafia type drug cartel a la you guessed it Scarface Your kid will probably love it All in all for what it is it s extremely well made Of course if you are worried that violence etc found in video games could negatively affect your child then you should by no means let them anywhere near it 
Simply the best I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas He loves it and he s got me hooked The game is everything they say and more You will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like The only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered 
Two words LIGHT GUN This game is FUN especially if you are a twitch gamer who has a few anger issues me The game is basically suped up duck hunt but I don t know why it is SO MUCH FUN The story mode is great fun and can be finished in a manner of hours if you are good the challenge mode is very challenging the unlockable crisis mode is probably the most fun I have ever had sniping in my entire life and to top it all off if you have another guncon Can you say MULTIPLAYER Also if you aren t aquainted with time crisis but are with other light gun games there is one BIIIIIIG difference Instead of desperately plugging everything that moves and preying you get it before it gets you you can hit one of the buttons on the guncon or release depending on your control style and take cover behind an object nearby But as with every game there are drawbacks For one if you don t have a guncon and don t have the money for the version w the guncon then you have to play with an awkward blue reticle that is INCREDIBLY slow If you have a larger TV then you cannot hit enemies on the sides at least I couldn t You have to calibrate the darn guncon every time you boot up the game and if you calibrate it wrong then you have to reset the ps2 and try again The graphics aren t the best on earth The storyline is wierd and hard to follow But no where near as bad as kingdom hearts SHEESH There is the incredibly tedious hookup process and if you have a smaller TV Let s just say you are gonna have to be three inches away from the screen to spot some enemies PLUS the multiplayer split screen is TINY VERY VERY TINY and if you want to play like the arcade you need a ps2 serial link cable From what I ve seen you cannot link two PS2s Via network adapter sowwy TWO guncons TWO TVs TWO Ps2s and TWO copies of time crisis 3 If you ain t got the dough you ain t gonna go Although it seems like the bad outweighs the good there s just something about nailing terrorists right in the head with a stream of lead that just feels oh so good This deserves a definate 5 out of 5 
Great Shooter Game Not Worth 60 This is one of the best shooter games ever but at 60 it is okay maybe worth 40 but still a great game overall It comes with a free gun which really cool but is really fragile hope this helps 
Not the Best in the Series but Still Good The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package Now the game is where it belongs On a handheld system The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series but it is for the most part an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim Final Fantasy V begins with a character named Bartz witnessing a meteorite come hurdling to the ground When he goes to investigate he meets up with Lenna Lenna is searching for her father who has gone off to the wind shrine to check on the wind crystal Lately the wind has been weak and it can only be because something is wrong with the wind crystal In addition to meeting Lenna Bartz also meets Galuf a man who has lost his memory in light of the meteorite crashing All he can remember is his name and that he too must also go to the wind shrine Eventually Bartz decides to travel with them and so your adventure begins In truth Final Fantasy V doesn t have a good storyline at least when compared to Final Fantasy IV and all the Final Fantasy games that appeared after the fifth installment It s pretty basic and generic This is obvious by how fast you ll meet your main party and how much more emphasis is put on gameplay These characters are not well developed nor is the story full of unbelievable plot twists Except Final Fantasy V was not meant to be about storyline It s all about the gameplay and that s where Final Fantasy V excels the most As with Final Fantasy IV before it Final Fantasy V uses the ATB battle system All your characters stand on one side of the screen while all the enemies stand on the other When a character s ATB gauge fills up you ll be able to issue commands The game then plays out in turn based fashion Final Fantasy V is simple yet it s a lot of fun and it also provides a challenge The gameplay is enhanced even more by the games complex job system The job system is extremely complex even by todays standards As you progress through the game you ll obtain job classes for your characters There are plenty of jobs Monks thieves white mages black mages and plenty more Each of them learn several different abilities all of which can and will be useful to you on your journey When you select a job with a certain character you ll have to battle to earn ability points so that they can learn all the abilities they can Some abilities are more useful than others and the possibilities are endless Also once a character learns an ability you can change jobs and have them equip it So a black mage could in fact use white magic provided he s learned the ability to do it You ll spend a lot of time on the field battling to get ability points The more abilities you learn the more ability points you ll need for the next This is fine and all but most enemies don t give up loads of ability points So the game puts a huge emphasis on battling This is also seen by the low amounts of experience enemies also give off Leveling up is a slow process The good news is battling is fun especially with the job system in place Unless everyone s jobs are the same there s a nearly endless possibility of commands you can give in the middle of battle Final Fantasy V Advance sports the same extras as all the previous Final Fantasy re releases on the GBA do An extra dungeons and some extra bosses and that s about it Nothing too big but worth the price nonetheless It ll probably take you 20 30 hours to complete Final Fantasy V It s not filled to the brim with secrets like future Final Fantasy titles but mastering all the jobs will really keep you busy for several hours alone It s also cool because along with the extra dungeons and bosses you ll get four new job classes This only adds more to the already complex gameplay Graphically Final Fantasy V is a little dated even by GBA standards It looks far better than it did in Final Fantasy Anthology It s much smoother and does have a little bit of an update but it doesn t go the extra mile it could ve Enemies still only flash to attack your characters and they re hardly animated At least the game has a great soundtrack Final Fantasy V goes on to show why the Super Nintendo era for Final Fantasy music was one of the best in the series The game just sounds really good Final Fantasy V is a golden treat for Final Fantasy fans It may have a weak storyline but what it lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay It s not the best in the series but it s still a really fun game The Good +It s a lot of fun to play +The job system makes for a lot of variety in your party +Great music +The minor graphic updates are welcome +Bonus dungeons and bosses +There s a huge emphasis on gameplay The Bad Not enough of a graphical update Weak story and character 
Yeah baby Even though other people doubt the gameplay of this game it is still cool Yeah it should be quot leashed quot Well I don t care what he says I m an AFL fan and I say this deserves 5 golden stars Go Red Dogs 
NOT ARENA NFL When I played Kurt Warner Arena Football for the first time I was dissapointed because at first I thought It was going to be like a real arena football game like madden or gameday but to my suprise it was like blitz and nfl extreme so if you want to buy a real football game buy madden 2001 
Arena Football should be leashed I am a fan of Arena Football I enjoy watching it because it is exciting but this game doesn t live up to the real game The game is very similiar to NFL Blitz except NFL Blitz is better What makes Unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass The most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up If you are thinking of buying this game rent it first to see if it is really worth the money

A really really really fun game Bully isn t game for kids I mean since it s a bad example for them I mean can cause trouble in school by throwing stink bombs or eggs at people Plus you get missions like having to still panties from the girls dorm for the gym teacher lol It also doesn t teach you to go by school rules Infect you get many missions to break school rules As someone old enough to not to do what I see on the game though it s a blast I mean I thought it was a game where you are in school the time But no you can even get out to town eventually and even have missions there The school stuff is fun but you can get tired of only being there Without doing the missions you just have class or can flirt with girls or start random fights or pick locks to lockers Plus you can start fights with those hallway geeks who chase you around if you are even a second late for class They then bring you to class if they catch you With all the Grand Theft Auto games basically all seeming exactly the same despite different missions it s nice to see fresh game from Rock Star Games I wouldn t recommed this to any parent to pick for their kid though Well unless they are in their 20 s lol and mature enough to do what they see in the game 
Fun and entertaining but a little too easy I enjoyed most aspects of this game and it quickly becaming addicting There was great satisfaction is beating people up and plenty of opportunity to fine tune my skills Overall though this game was definately on the easy side Compared to the Grand Theft Auto games of which I was never able to complete I finished this one in just over a week The final challenge was particularly simple and I really expected more Still I d recommened this game however rent it don t buy 
School Days Aren t Always Fun and Happy People can pick on the Rockstar group for their Grand Theft Auto series but I actually found the Bully game much more redeeming You re a schoolboy taking on the stereotypical cliques It s pretty clear why you re a depressed teenage boy when the game starts Apparently your dad has died and your mom has remarried an elderly grumpy old man who wants you out of the picture Your mom is more than happy to dump you off at a stay all year school while she goes off with Mr Moneybucks On top of that the school officials are pretty nasty to you right from the start Hogwarts this is not Then as you go into the run down dorm other kids start beating up on you It s time for you to stand up for yourself and make a stand There are various groups of kids in this school the nerds the jocks the greasers and the preppies Activities you do raise or lower your respect level with each group You have to go to class too and be there on time If you re able to manage your schedule properly you can participate in some pretty fun mini games the word scramble can be challenging to earn you new skills There are girls to court and usually they want a specific item So you have numerous quests to go on The bully activities range from escorting a nerd safely to his locker to running races and protecting yourself from attacks You get clothing along the way and can customize your look within school regulations of course It s a bit depressing sometimes to see how these mid teen guys treat each other but this does actually happen in many schools I m sure pretty much every person who was once a teen can name the cliques that existed in their school The graphics are rather good for a PS2 and the sounds while again a bit depressing for a teen environment work well with the game too On one hand I can not really like the swearing in the game but certain teens do in fact swear far worse than this game does I d even say this is more like Fable than other Grand Theft Autos with some of the ways that you can choose how you react in situations This game won t be enjoyed by people who are squeamish about violence it does after all involve teen guys all bashing each other for very inane reasons It also involves a lot of bullying as you might imagine Still if you can deal with those issues you ll find a really involving game that might actually make you think about how to treat others well 
An interactive twist for the Law Order crowd This is unique game that takes a keen eye and the ability to remember small details Many times whether or not you re successful will depend on how good you are at finding inconsistencies in testimony or things that just don t sound right The animation is very lo tech where each scene is just a stationary backdrop If there is a character you are interacting with they will cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states as it suits the dialog There is a LOT of reading and unfortunately some of the characters love to talk The music is simple and infectious the interface is easy to navigate either via touch stylus or buttons and you can save your state in the game at any time so you can take the cases at your own pace It s a unique game that is just a rewarding as it is frustrating The characters are interesting and if you own a DS this game is worth having 
Take That I was a little late to the booming cult following that Phoenix Wright has acquired having just bought the game this month However it did not dissapoint I was always a fan of the point and click adventures on the PC but was dissapointed with Trace Memory not so much that it was a bad game but it was soo short I was hesitant to spend the money again on a game I could beat in about 10 hours time but luckily I did Phoenix Wright is one of those games that has enough challenge to it that you don t feel like you are breezing effortlessly through it yet is open enough for younger players to be able to play and enjoy it as well The length of the game is fairly long with five cases to solve each one becoming longer and more difficult as you play I must say you really get into the characters in this game as each case is connected in some way to the others and I really liked the last case that added the use of luminol and finger printing tools makes you feel all CSI and stuff I look forward to the second one coming out soon and definately recommend this as one of the best on the DS right now 
There should be more games like this for the DS I finally got a DS and one of the first older games I tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was Phoenix Wright I ve been Jonesing for this game for awhile now It s unique and entertaining The choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it s too much fun to not love this title This is the type of game that makes the DS so unique and proud to say that I own this system More games should take note and follow in it s footsteps This is a must buy for any DS library Other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are Trauma Center and Trace Memory This system was made for these types of games These games are why I will always trust in Nintendo for high quality and interesting games Game on 
An Ace for Phoenix Wright One of the best DS games I ever had It does not take to be a lawyer to get fully satisfied with this game Although this is a heavily text based game I mean really heavy you won t get tired of reading the storylines and following the details I know you won t find this in any stores nowadays so try to order here at Amazon This game s one of the best 
Original fun I ordered this game based on reviews alone It s great Will not disappoint The only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected Other than that a great game Hope to see a sequel 
One of the best for the Nintendo DS This game is a lot of fun From the start to the end you will be sucked into this game and will not be able to put it down Interviewing witness s finding clues cross examinations in court There is a lot to do and it is fun and invigorating Buying this game will not leave you dissapointed only wishing for more 
Bigger Is Better With Nintendo riding very high on the handheld gaming market with the Game Boy Advance they ve also shown their stuff with the success of the Nintendo DS as well and a newer recently redesigned version of the DS called the DS Lite These stylus pens are specifically for the Nintendo DS Lite only and work very well for all gamers They are simple to control and play around with for games like Magnetica New Super Mario Bros Tetris DS and many others The control of these pens are easy to use and handle for all gamers This is a absolute must for DS Lite owners Price A Convience A Overall 
Good is a sonym its the original Nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price 
playstation 2 black dualshock controller Bought a few months ago and It is brand new in company package works great smooth black 
Good quality controller Since i bought my PS2 I ve never got to buy aditional controllers but everything has an end so i had to buy new ones The first thing i did was to buy one of those controls in a store of my country i don t know where they where manufactured i guess they were copies i m not sure but they did t work one month after So i took the decision to buy this ones they are perfect i strongly recommend this product 
help needed can somebody tell me if a PS1 DUAL SHOCK controller works on a PS2 thank 
PS2 controller Ok I ve had this controller for 3 years and nothing happend to it It has fallen maney times and nothing happend Some kid wrote that it s a rip off for 24 bucks Well thats the best deal you ll get IT s way better than the stupid bulky xbox controllers xbox may have better grathics but the games stink and xbox s can catch on fire 
Best football game I like the football games Especially the good ones This one is no exception In fact it may be the best I ve played I had Madden 2003 and I was pretty addicted to it but 2006 changed that So many improvements have been made like the new QB Vision That s a pretty neat thing to use but it takes a while to get the hang of it You can turn it off and play old style if you want though The franchise mode has been well improved and I think i ve gotten to where I spend more time dealing with the owner things than actually playing football It s pretty cool The only thing about that though is you can no longer turn the salary cap off so you have to contract players within the means of a budget which can teach you a lot about how owners operate The new superstar mode is cool too and you can become an NFL legend I haven t yet played the online mode yet but I hear it is good too 
Great game except for This is a fun game the only thig i can say is that i wish PS2 or sony could have a web site where you can download the current rosters and the next seasons games It kinda sucks if i want to play next season i guess i will have to go out and buy madden 2007 with updated rosters 
Lemony Snickets Series of Unfortunate events Ecellent best game ever Educational but fun Scary and enoyable graphics perfect and has a long lasting story line 
If you like to get down This game is great My 4 year old enjoys trying to keep up and gets super excited whenever she gets an A I love to do this when I don t feel like going to the gym It s great fun and a quick sweat Thirty minutes of this and your done My workout buddy came over for dinner last week and my daughter wanted her to play I told her to play for her workout she didn t think it would make her sweat But oh boy was she sweating quickly The only con to this is the controllers if I could just get good enough to not land on the wire box I am shopping around for a new one right now 
Good exercise This is a fun game for young and older folks It is also a great way to exercise without the monotony of scrunches etc It is a little awkward at first to navigate the set up procedure but once you catch on the fun begins even for 50 somethings like me 
Variety and fun too I have the first version of this game but got the newer one which is even more fun It has several more challenges levels styles and variety I haven t yet tried them all but it s worth the because of the different games and players you get Plus you can unlock different musi and play with your hands too Both my 13 yr old son and I are enjoying the exercise we get with it and this version is very similar to the arcade one so we practice and then go to the arcade and can get our monies worth 
Fun and Addicting DDR Extreme 2 is a very fun game I just bought it yesterday and I am already used to it It is very easy to catch on to You simply press the arrows on a dance mat when they reach the arrows on the top of the screen On free play the levels are from easiest to hardest Beginner Light Standard and Heavy I after a day of use am already working on some songs on the light level The higher the level the faster and more complicated footwork Some of my favorite songs are Butterfly upswing My My My Boom Boom Dollar Captain Jack and Get Busy If you have two dance mats you can connect them and compete against a friend or even harder yet dance by yourself using two mats I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 to anyone who would like some highly addictive fun while getting into shape 
Xbox Version is better The Xbox version of this game is way better For one the graphics are enhanced not crappy like the PS2 version And second of all loading time and processing time is is literally cut in half SO DONT BUY THIS VERSION SUCK IT UP AND BUY AN XBOX oh and if this game bores you you either weren t using cheats or u havent played the missions atleast through los santos 
Killing people never gets old How do you follow up a runaway success like 2001 s Grand Theft Auto III Rockstar North responded a year later with GTA Vice City a game that took the gameplay of its predecessor and expanded it considerably At the same time Vice City gave the series an extensive and amazing stylistic makeover drenching the experience in the sights sounds and attitude of Miami Florida from the mid 80s So where do you go from there You take it statewide Grand Theft Auto San Andreas expands the series concept to encompass three entire cities as well as the countryside between them The gameplay similarly expands packing in some explosive set pieces and amazing action movie like thrills while maintaining that same remarkably fun freefom GTA feel In short Rockstar has done it again San Andreas definitely lives up to the Grand Theft Auto name In fact it s arguably the best game in the series Just when you think you re getting used to gang warfare everything goes sour We re certainly not interested in spoiling the game s many interesting plot twists so we ll leave out the details but it should suffice to say that you ll eventually need to get the heck out of Los Santos You wind up in the country outside the city where you ll encounter many more great characters and officially embark on your quest to put right what s gone wrong Once you get out of Los Santos you won t really have to worry about gang warfare for a while and the game settles down into a more GTA like feel Like the previous games in the series San Andreas features a fairly linear story that takes you through the game s areas You ll start off restricted to Los Santos something the story justifies by claiming that an earthquake has taken out the bridges and roads that link Los Santos to the surrounding area but it doesn t take long to unlock the other two areas The game also throws in some pretty great surprises in the form of characters from previous entries in the series These characters tie the GTA games together really nicely so while San Andreas feels pretty different from the other games in the series it still feels like you re playing in the same universe The game also tracks a lot of other statistics Respect is a big one as it s what you ll be earning the most of as you complete missions Not all missions earn you money but almost all of them are good for a slight respect bonus A higher respect rating lets you recruit more and more gang members to follow you around and shoot at rival gangs which is another new addition and a nice perk but not something that comes in handy very often You re also rated in a lot of different vehicle categories like driving riding motorcycles bicycling and piloting aircraft As you use a vehicle your skill with it slowly increases which seems to tighten up the controls a bit In the case of motorcycles it also makes it less likely that you ll fly off the bike in a wreck Your bicycling skills translate into higher bunny hops Similarly you re given stats for every type of firearm in the game You ll start with poor skills with all weapons but don t let the tag of poor fool you CJ s skills feel roughly the same as Tommy Vercetti s when you first squeeze the trigger After getting in some time with a weapon you ll upgrade it to gangster level which extends your lock on range with the weapon speeds up reloading and in some cases lets you walk around while locked on Upgrading your skill with a weapon to the highest level hitman takes a relatively long time but it extends the lock on range and speeds up reloading even further and it also opens up the ability to dual wield some one handed weapons Unloading two full clips of submachine gun ammo is extremely satisfying here Just like in all GTA games the thing that makes GTA go up and over the freedom to walk around a huge map doing whatever the hell you want to do You dont just have to do the missions half of the fun is wandering around and killing people Usually when a game tries to do a million different things it s an overambitious hodge podge that can t manage to get its different parts down cold Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has you doing many many more things than any previous GTA game and while some of them do work a little better than others the strength of all these different gameplay elements too many to count makes for a powerful package that does not disappoint despite the extremely high standards that Grand Theft Auto established and that San Andreas needed to live up to With its strong story well written dialogue terrific voice cast impressive graphics great in game sound and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn t be missed 
THE BEST GAME EVER This is the best game in the world Its really cool you can make him fat by eating food over and over again And the missions are very challenging but fun I really do recommend this game and i really recommend you to buy it The game is really lifelike And the graphics are very good This is the best game i own and i own ALOT OF PS2 GAMES There are 100s of cool fun things you can do in this game The cars are very cool You can go shopping you can buys houses get jobs and even have girlfriends you can even take karate and loose weight or gain weight or work and stuff they have San francisco san ferro las vegas las venturas las angeles los satos etc And many more towns they have lots of cool things to do in this game and you will have to buy it to find out I REALLY RECOMMEND GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS GET THE GAME TODAY I PROMIS YOU WILL LOVE IT 
Most real time entertaining game to hit PS2 This game has been out for a while And I have been playing it for a long time now Have I ever had a boring moment while playing GTA SA No I honestly have cherished every moment of gameplay Why Because this game has so much content and capability that it is not possible to dislike this game if you have actually sat down to play and appreciate it People giving GTA SA low ratings must be joking CONTROL Superb When I want my character to do something he does it no questions asked If I want to fire a gun at an enemy I get to fire the gun without having to put up with errors or jams If I want to hop in a car and take off I get to do just that CONTENT This game is a vast improvement over even GTA III There is so much to do that it is impossible to ever get bored Every second is entertaining there is always something to work on and or improve Challenging missions are everywhere and if you don t want to do missions you can go lift weights build up your muscles or you can go put some neat features colors on your personal cars RADIO Good stations that have songs that cover just about any genre GRAPHICS Of course there is always room to make graphics better but the graphics on this game were very good despite there being so much on the disk This game covers everything and there is never really a let down If you haven t bought played this game I suggest that you do It is worth every penny and will keep you entertained for accumulated weeks at a time Good luck 
Great system but Yes the Xbox has to be the best video game system I have ever bought I own also a GameCube me being a big Mario fan Sierously who isnt I ve had my Xbox for oh two years But recently it has died I m not sure what went wrong The cords are fine I ve even bought replacement cords but it just wont come to life I was thinking of buying an Xbox 360 until I read all the bad reviews Apperently the 360 has some kinks in it So I plan on buying another Xbox If I were you I would purchase an Xbox not a 360 Ups Great graphics Sound = awesome Game genre is awesome No need for memory cards You can use the consol as a DVD player and a music player Downs Controllers are a bit bulkish A bit faulty Obviously more ups than downs 
Great Buy I have owned an XBOX for over 3 years now and it was really the best gaming machine of the last generation Mine has worked perfectly I love the music soundtracks where you can load your own CDs unto the hard drive and play them instead of certian game sountracks The game selection is much better on the xbox as are the graphics You get Halo Project Gotham Racing 2 Midtown Madness 3 a must have fun game and Xbox Live I have used my xbox to play DVDs and as a Media Center Extender with purchase of 25 Kit that comes with the Remote and it works well no fumbling with your controller like on the PS2 just a simple remote 
Great Game Hello my name is Zachary I am really enjoying The Series of Unfortunate Events video game as it is very fun It has mini games within the game itself You can invent things from pieces and parts that you find in the game Sometimes you have to deafeat Count Olaf s henchmen with either Klaus or Violet Also if there are small holes Sunny can crawl through them The only flaw I found with the game is that the overall game is too short 
Great game based upon the movie I very much enjoyed this game and I think it may be my favorite X BOX game I own I Kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better One funny part about this game is the part where you are Sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off I reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable 
Great but Short Great game to rent Fun inventions as well as mini games only problem I rented it monday morning and after about 4 1 2 hours of game play i had beat it Rent don t buy it 
I disagree The books are awsome I have read almost ALL of them and really wanna play the game thanks for all the great reviews I just wanna say the books are not stupid They are all very very good You just have to actually READ the 
A fun game for all ages I enjoyed this game quite a bit I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one You play as the three Baudelaire kids The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely as you must first escape Count Olaf s decrepit mansion then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty s herpetology paradise Aunt Josephine s seaside town and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death The environments are attractive and fun to explore and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating For most of the game as you explore environments solve puzzles search for secret rooms and such you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please For many important events such as boss fights you must play as one or the other as they each have different skills and weapons For some sequences those that are basically 2D platformer sections the entire game has some platformer aspects but it s usually loosely employed and 3D you must play as Sunny the baby Baudelaire and this is the only time you can play as her The various puzzles and challenges they almost amount to a series of mini games are varied and mostly non repetitive helping retain your interest Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform but some are appropriately more challenging both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller and take many tries to complete A couple first person shooter sequences the game is mostly in a third person mode are especially challenging particularly the end but that s the final boss fight so that s to be expected Like most games winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern which takes both brains and manual dexterity There are a couple negatives with the game but they are minor Games like this released in response to the success of a film are often rushed through production That becomes evident here in the cut scenes which are not very exciting they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us But I d rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play and that s just what was done here Also although the graphics are wonderful for the most part the visuals are a bit dark overall I found it best to play with the lights off With a bright overhead light on the glare was too much to see important information in the game Finally I would have preferred a different save game scheme as you can only save when the game asks if you want to and the save points seem almost random Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task Sometimes you have to do long sequences and sometimes a number of challenging ones before you can save again The game isn t quite as funny as the film and doesn t have exactly the same magical atmosphere but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world The soundtrack by Jeremy and Julian Soule and inspired by Thomas Newman s great soundtrack for the film is also a major asset I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else 
Just pay the extra money The truth is that these memory cards do not have all that much space on them so you will certainly want to buy two I ve made thousands of saves on these cards and only ever had ONE go corrupt so to say these cards work extremely well has to be an understatement Plus they come in a variety of different colors There are many cheaper memory cards made by various manufacturers but almost all of them seem to have issues of some variety some have problems where data magically disappears some has issues with saves failing just avoid that hassle altogether The cost value ratio may seem poor at first but just surf around the web and find 2 for 29 99 you won t regret it in the long run 
Best PS2 Memory Card This is the best memory card you can get for the PS2 Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 2PK Memory Cards Rumors spread that non Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards 
A must have for any PS2 owner period Without this memory card there is no fun When you re playing a game for a few hours and get really far you will definitely wanna save it Without the memory card you will have to do everything all over again With the memory card you can save up and continue playing later Really that s all the information you need Pick it up today 
Necessity Anyone witha PS2 has one It s that simple It s not exactly great because because it s annoying in the first place that the feature of memory wasnt on the PS2 in the first place

A Great Game completely engaging and challenging FarCry rates as great with my other most memorable gaming titles see below FarCry was a true step forward in visual quality and the intelligence of the adversaries FarCry is great mix of indoor levels and also large outdoor landscapes to travel over A great game really takes you in and you feel like you have been in the game s world after playing for an hour or so Other games I rate as great Unreal Quake II Halflife I and II MDK Descent II Hitman Ghost Recon Splinter Cell Max Payne Deus Ex Myst 
arguably the best shooter ever made I recently picked this game up because the laptop I had purchased for college was finally a computer powerful enough to run it It is easily one of the best computer games I ve ever played The playing world is massive you can literally walk to any mountain or monument you see in the distance and there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal and or solve a mission The basic plot is this you are Jack Carver who has accompanied a woman to a part of Micronesia for undisclosed reasons she turns out to be a CIA agent and before long she is kidnapped and you are fighting for your life against an army of well trained mercenaries It s a fairly generic shooter plot but it gets the point across and ties everything together well The enemy AI is unbelievably good The soldiers work together to take you down all the while dropping hilariously bad one liners like HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE APPLES RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES MOFO I M GONNA TEAR YOU A NEW ONE The shootouts that result in this game are a blast you really have to get good cover and strategize your fight It s the first shooter I ve played that makes me feel like I m actually in an action movie The vehicles are one of the game s biggest highlights If you want to move quicker downstream you can snipe at occupants of the frequent patrol boats on the water and steal their ride You can often obtain RVs and ATVs and at one point in the game a forklift for reasons unknown These are a blast as you can drive right through the enemies firing at you One thing I enjoy doing is driving full speed at an enemy and bailing out at the last second Always good fun The game is also a great challenge I just completed the game on the Medium setting and it was still almost impossible in places Fighting the trigens the small monkey like creatures with claws is a nightmare on any diffculty as they can outrun and outJUMP you and kill you with often a single hit I strongly suggest using the sniper rifle or a powerful machine gun other than the M4 on them at long distance before they really mess you up In short this is the best FPS I have ever played and probably one of the best computer games ever made overall Highly recommended on a side note not that it matters to me but I m personally surprised this game got a Mature rating there is barely any blood at all and none of it sticks on the floor And when shot with a rocket launcher people don t explode like normally in Mature rated shooters This game SHOULD have been rated TEEN 
Great gaming experience It s a great game featuring an awesome engine The single player campaign is really good and the multiplayer is ok totally recomended 
This is an Awesome game should be played by WAYYY more people I ve played Half Life 2 and Battlefield 2 and this is more enjoyable for what it is Now for multiplayer BF2 is better by far too For detailed graphics HL 2 is better But for a single player experience with open ended routes to your objectives good graphics engaging AI HUGE open environments different types of opponents guns maps and so on this is a great game I have replayed the whole thing once and many levels many many times I would recommend this over any other first person shooter I ve played For multiplayer BF2 CS or Desert Combat which I think I liked best maybe of those but for stand alone Far Cry I hope Crytek hurries up and makes some new PC game with their engine which blows BF2 out of the water someone should and can even though BF2 is a great game 
Great Great Game I m not a huge FPS fan but every once in a while I need to fulfill my animalistic urges to blow something up and lay waste to others FarCry is a beautiful game topped only by its playability The AI is smart and will sneak around and flank call for backup sound alarms etc instead of just barrleing straight at you A couple of times I ve made the mistake of focusing on one guy or area and had another enemy pop up right in my face from the side The graphics are amazing My comp isn t a beast it s pretty standard by today s means but I have put in a 256MB GeForce graphics card Standing on top of a hill everything miles away is still crystal clear and detailing hasn t diminished at all it s absolutely gorgeous Physics of the game are great and operate realistically Get this game you won t be disappointed 
The best FPS of all time Even though there are several good reviews already here and this game is already a couple of years old I still feel compelled to put my two cents in about my favorite game I ve played a number of other first person shooters but no other game comes even close In fact I have trouble playing other FPS s now because they lack so many of the things that make Far Cry exceptional This game is definitely not for everyone though If you are more interested in shoot em up alien games like Doom or story driven puzzle solving shooters like Half Life then you may not like Far Cry If however you are like me and prefer strategic calculated shooters without too much fluff then Far Cry is definitely the game for you So what makes Far Cry unique On a large scale the graphics level design and balance come to mind I still have not seen a game with better overall graphics The levels are huge and open ended giving you the freedom to plan your approach This gives the game plenty of replayability there are numerous effective strategies for each level as well as enabling each individual player to use his or her own style The game is hard and it uses a checkpoint system so there is little margin for error Normally I d like the option to quicksave but in Far Cry the checkpoint system works very well A quicksave system would ruin the open endedness of the game On the more difficult levels exposing yourself to enemy fire spells rapid death The game is as close to realistic in this regard as any I ve seen Even on the easiest level however Far Cry is no walk in the park The AI is smart and uses strategy It doesn t just rush you blindly unless the odds are in its favor The first level is anything but a tutorial and the action starts quickly The game is long but contrary to what another reviewer said I have never found it to be repetitive and I ve replayed it twice The levels are distinct and each has its unique challenges This brings us to the gameplay what separates Far Cry from every other shooter on the market In may opinion Far Cry is perfect in this aspect of the game First of all vehicles play an important role in the game Unlike in many games if you see something you can use it There are multiple boats trucks a hang glider even a forklift and each has its place and its benefits Then there is the weapons system All of the guns in Far Cry are useful and well balanced You can carry four weapons which again to me is the perfect number Just enough to add variety but not so many as to make the game totally unrealistic or so few that it becomes annoying This brings me to the controls This area is where Far Cry beats out every other FPS in my opinion You come equipped with binoculars which track your enemies and are essential component of gameplay You have a stealth meter so you know when enemies are becoming aware of your movements Instead of just always running you will find yourself stealthily crouching to avoid enemies And last but definitely not least you can crawl I have no idea why this isn t implemented in more games Crawling provides you with the most stealth and steadies your aim considerably Since there are only a few places in the game where you can run in with guns blazing and expect to stay alive crawling is vital to your survival You can lean and fire at the same time I have also never seen these two combined in a game I think all games should have this feature So in conclusion this is by far my favorite shooter and if you like any of the same kinds of things I do then you should buy this game immediately Its only weakness is that it requires a fairly good system to run smoothly and does have a number of large patches If you like exploring beautiful environments spending time planning your approach and making full use of your range of controls on a regular basis then I highly recommend this game It is intricate and very challenging Just writing this review makes me look forward to playing it a fourth time 
Exciting tactical FPS Game I was hearing and reading all the rave over this game and I finally got it myself As you can tell by my giving it a high star rating I really like it so I m a raver now However if you ve not played it but are used to First Person Shooter FPS games you may find this one somewhat unique The main difference between Far Cry and other popular FPS games like the Halo and Doom series is this game is not as fast paced Far Cry requires more sneaking around use of cover diversions etc All in all it requires more of a tactical approach rather than a bust in the room and mow em down with the shotgun approach But still there are certainly intense moments on just about every stage where the action is hot On the technical side This game is very robust and requires an array of strong computing components to run it The install requires 4GB I have a Dell w a 2 6 GHz processor 512 MB of Ram and a 64 MB GEForce 4 MX video card It runs the game no problem but I had to do one little code modification regarding DirectX 9 0 but that was easy I would highly recommend a 128 MB video card so you can run the game on richer graphic settings If you are like me and you prefer using a game pad rather than the keyboard mouse you re out of luck There s just no option for any other method of control However as much as I prefer my Logitech Rumble Pad I ve found that the keyboard mouse is just fine for this game actually the precision of a good mouse is probably preferable So if you haven t got it yet check it out 
Most PC s do not run the game as is It used to be and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new that as long as your PC was not too old you could run any game on it No so with Oblivion and some other new games I believe To run Oblivion as is you need a machine with a high end graphics card So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming or specifically updated the graphics card Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen without telling you why While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC a dual core with 1G of RAM And no it still does not run if you install the manufacturer s patch However all is not completely lost I was able to install Oldblivion just Google for it to find the site and another patch from the Oldblivion site and now it runs acceptably With Oldblivion and the other patch the graphics are still pretty good better than Morrowind though understandably not nearly as good as the screenshots online however it tends to crash every so often its unclear whether or not this is due to graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs in the game Nonetheless if have a high end graphics card or have the patience to apply all the unofficial online patches the game is pretty cool I was not a big fan of Morrowind but Oblivion has a number of improvements over Morrowind in my opinion 1 You can fast travel just open up a map and click to all cities and any sites that you have been to before And even when you cannot fast travel to a new place you can usually walk in a nearly straight line there in Morrowind it was maddening to go someplace since I often would end up running into mountains that I could not climb 2 Oblivion is not so dark and gloomy like Morrowind was 3 NPC speak this to me is a huge benefit in Morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would have to to through pages of text dialouge if I wanted to read I would pick up a book not play a computer game 4 There is a quest arrow that points towards the person you need to see In Morrowind it was incredibly tedious to track people down 5 And finally a minor point the names of people do not look like the programmers mashed the hand on the keyboard in Morrowind there were quests like go see ERAJGUKADFHS and ask about SAKDFHSLKDJF I just don t need that when I am playing a computer game One thing that I do not care for about Oblivion is the way the monsters level with you The first character I had I got up to level 15 and found myself being beaten up by goblins Unless you powergame that is stragically plan your leveling to maximize stats and combat skills or turn the difficulty way down the leveling of monsters makes the game a real pain combat related quests such as with the painted trolls should not get harder the more you level All in all it is a pretty fun game but before you buy make sure you have a high end graphics card or a lot of patience 
Excellent but I still miss Morrowind The title doesn t imply anything negative I just really liked morrowind s exotic cities and cultural clashes This game makes you move your virtual life from Morrowind to the Imperial Province which is more similar to an earthly historical place Now that the sentimental stuff is out of the way on to the good stuff The graphics are much much better than Morrowind My system isn t over the recommended settings but I still play smoothly by choosing my settings correctly and it looks very good The models are much more detailed to the effect that you ll sometimes even gasp when you run into an attractive female who got her clothes stolen Sound is just as good as Morrowind and the main theme is a tribute to the Morrowind main theme There are a lot of voices in this game and it is possible to not have to read any of the conversions and just listen to the NPCs You can thankfully skip over lines that you don t want to hear if you are a fast reader Just like Morrowind you can also add new songs to the music folder if you want to use a custom soundtrack Control is improved Blocking is so much better that even if you aren t a warrior you can hold your own in melee against the common enemies The new magic casting does take some getting used to and so does the unified menus Controls do feel more like a console game and Oblivion s battles are a lot more action based than Morrowind s As for gameplay most of the changes are for the better The cities were improved seemingly using a Gothic 2 like model It seems to me they also took hunting and the radiant AI from playing that game It fits TES very nicely Enemies level up now so leveling up the wrong skills may get you into trouble at the higher levels but so far it hasn t bothered me Trading is different and I m not sure it s improved that much Lockpicking gives you the option to do a minigame but you can also do it the Morrowind way Speechcraft is thankfully much more improved Stealing is also more elaborate Steal from a store and hang around and the guards will come looking for you even if nobody actually saw you stealing The missions are now more elaborate and even the most trivial ones may surprise you with some funny emotional and even sensual topics Travel is different with no more stilt riders boats or guild guides Now you have a horse option they actually fight too and a fast travel option to places you ve been to before or major sites you haven t been to yet But in the end this is still TES All you re old Morrowind tricks like repairing bound armor shooting arrows while levitating beating people to a pulp with your bare hands and gaining magicka by fighting your own creatures is still possible On a personal note I m glad the Atronach birthsign now gives you 50 spell absortion along with stunted magicka If you liked Morrowind you ll most likely like this one as well Players who were put off by Morrowind s low level combat should try Oblivion Players who traditionally don like deep RPGs should give it a chance Like hack and slash games Create a stereotypical warrior and join the fighters guild Like stealth games Create a stereotypical thief and join the thieves guild You may just like it enough to try out new things 
Oblivion de lo mejor No solo para los RPG Fans Se que hay muchos que no gustan de los RPG s de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos Asi que al empezar a jugar Oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas y el gameplay Al principio no me pareci� gran cosa pero cuando sales la primera vez a campo abierto Incre�ble te quita el aliento Una vez empiezas a recorrer todo el reino de Tamriel el juego te atrapa y cr�anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar y seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos y maravillas Cuando pienses en Oblivion no imagines un juego tipo las Final Fantasy o los t�picos RPG s japoneses este es un RPG que apela a un publico mucho m�s amplio Aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda o aventuras como Enclave e incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como Splinter Cell encontraran aqu� algo para ellos Camino a la gloria ES4 Oblivion te coloca en el Rol de un prisionero que por alguna raz�n fuiste parte de un sue�o del Emperador Uriel Septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar a Tamriel de un oscuro grupo Daedra conocido como Mythic Dawn De esta forma empiezas a vagar por las catacumbas ayudando a los guardias a proteger al emperador sin embargo el emperador es asesinado y tu eres la unica esperanza de detener a este culto y cerrar las puertas de Oblivion y as� detener la invasi�n de los Daedra a Tamriel Es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaci�n de tu personaje que habilidades deseas cuales ser�n tus fortalezas y debilidades Dependiendo te tus elecciones podr�s ser un guerrero un mago un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer a cualquier raza que desees Conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia �Como hacerlo eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste hay toda una gama de habilidades a desarrollar Empaca tus cosas Oblivion posee infinidad de misiones a realizar aproximadamente 500 horas de juego claro esta hay una misi�n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador y cerrar la puertas de oblivion sin embargo si as� lo deseas puedes ignorarla y tomar otras b�squedas como unirte a la Hermandad de los magos � a la de los Luchadores pelear en la arena ganar fama y fortuna o simplemente explorar y ayudar a los diferentes habitantes de Tamriel en sus vidas diarias Cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras ahora estaremos hablando de Oblivion El reino de Tamriel es enorme hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra los personajes parecen tener vida propia sus problemas discusiones mitos etc Ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas y mazmorras donde explor�ndolas descubrir�s toda clase de Items que te ayudar�n completar las tareas que hayas escogido Lo bueno lo malo y lo caro En el apartado grafico Oblivion realmente te quita el aliento los paisajes las monta�as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes Los �rboles se mueven con el viento igual que el follaje Los atardeceres y amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares esto agregado a que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace a Oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio a fin si es que hay fin Sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca etc sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece Y lo caro todo tiene un precio si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una PC relativamente potente Aunque hay un parche para PC s no muy potentes Shut the Jaws of Oblivion Oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del a�o asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fant�stico Si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje a Tamriel y cr�anme ser�n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras 
The highest evolution of the computer RPG to date If you have an RPG bone in your body back in the days of paper RPG who didnt dream of a game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting the undead finding magic loot avoiding traps all with near cartoon quality graphics Thats the game we all wanted Now finally I believe this is the first game that fufills all aspects of what all RPG ers envisioned in a game The world is free form the enemy creatures are well animated and pose a challenge in combat all the characters dialogue is real speech Theres a strong and challenging main quest to complete As well you can take your character on many twists and turns Want to be a professional thief you can do it Want to be a murderer and do hits you can shame on you Want to be a good guy and help out people you can The gameworld itself is massive you can trapse across the gorgeous and sometimes dangerous countryside crossing rivers mountains grassy plains The seasons change and the stars light up at night it really is graphically amazing Thats where it pays to have a top of the line PC the graphics are amazing so you better have a current system You can get by with say a Athlon 3000xp and a 9800pro but with part prices so cheap why would you want to Not Doom3 not Halflife 2 not Prey this is the game thats pressing people to upgrade their machine And with Athlon 64 s and 16 pipe 256mb graphics cards fairly cheap i d say its worth upgrading just to play this game I have an Athlon 64 4000 and a 256mb x800xl and I run the game at 1024x768 at high detail The game ran well but in some outdoor locations and in combat when things got busy it would slow down a bit so I dialed back the draw distance a bit and the plant draw distance and now everything is almost always very smooth I think plant draw distance is one of the easiest things to dial back to get more FPS without sacrificing visual quality I really cant do this game justice in a review I am at a loss for words to fully convey this games greatness However I will say if you have even a tiny love of paper or computer RPGs this game is for you If you enjoy final fantasy type games the freedom in this game will bowl you over If you like the idea of a free form fantasy world you will want to get this In fact I have a hard time imagining anyone with the proper computer to run this game not liking it Though if I had to imagine someone who wouldnt its someone who hates stories cant be bothered with dialogue and simply wants to blast things for hours But they have Doom 3 so they re happy too 
Never liked RPG s until now My son told me about this game after he got his Xbox 360 I said sure it s your birthday Happy Birthday and I got him the game WOW I watched him play the game and it was fun just to watch him play I went and bought my own copy for my pc and I am totally hooked Great game play RPG and FPS The best of both worlds It is completely immersing and sucks you in from the get go One of the great features is that you can change you character before leaving the sewers I am currenly playing as a Khajit and a Dark Elf stealth vs fighter mage and seeing how each affects game play It really does make a difference I totally recommend this game I loved it so much I went and bought ES III Morrowind GOTY with Tribunal and Bloodmoon Highly recommended How much more can I say Great quests and plotlines it can make a difference which quest you do first dont worry it doesnt kill the game play as to what you can get I am already Arena Grand Champion and I have made a killing going Laura Croft all over the place Note if you get this game do yourself a favor and get the addons it makes a great game fantastic One final note I have a P4 3Ghz 2GB memory w Nvidia 6200oc 256 and it plays the game great I run the game at 800x600 and the graphics are fantastic 
Cute game for kids in the 6 10 range This is a well done game especially if you liked the movie Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there s a cute storyline to the game There are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next There s a pretty small age window that its good for I d say about 6 to 10 Under 6 the stages are too hard Over 10 they re sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it s still well done and worth buying 
Madagascar This was a particularly good game for our younger kids though our 9 year old was able to finish the entire game in a weekend Our 7 year old continues to enjoy it without the same degree of frustration that he experiences with some other games that are a bit too old for him This game was great even though the kids have not seen the movie 
Finally a true kid friendly game Many games my kids have aren t actually geared towards kids This game is perfect for children It s fun without being too hard or easy My children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained I highly recommend this as a great family game Many games we can take turns playing 
Great Machine but just keeps crashing Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze No biggie Then it died No problem sent it in for repairs under warranty Free of charge Cool Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM Ring of Death Warranty over 130 140 dollars to fix Yay I think I m going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects 
Best system for gaming hands down The next gen console wars are now officially in full swing with the release of the PS3 and Wii So that leaves everyone with the decision of choosing the right system I ll start with saying that the Wii fits a different demographic than the PS3 and 360 perhaps a gamer looking for something different or perhaps a system for a family with young ones Also if you want to try to get your girlfriend to play games with you this system would be the one to do it To me it makes a good second console but for the hardcore gamer this is not going to satisfy as a core gaming machine The real battle for the traditional hardcore gamer market is between the 360 and the PS3 I own a 360 and have followed the PS3 closely until release and have played it The two systems are very close in power regardless of what Sony s marketing hype and brainwashing tactics might lead you to believe The Cell processor cannot slice bread and let s just leave it at that Currently the better library belongs to the 360 It has more AAA titles than the PS3 and it will remain that way throughout 2007 The Xbox 360 simply has a better lineup Gears of War is one of the best games you will ever play it is incredible in every way and features new gameplay mechanics that make it more than just another cookie cutter shooter like Resistance I would call Resistance a very good game but Gears is a truly great game Lost Planet exclusive to Xbox will follow this up in early 2007 with more 3rd person shooting action If you have not seen this game prepare to be amazed RPGs are covered with Oblivion the upcoming galactic epic Mass Effect and the eerie underwater adventure RPG BioShock Alan Wake is another hit in the making along with Too Human from talented developer Silicon Knights That is a lot of brand new IPs for the 360 Sony no longer has a hold on Grand Theft Auto and we will see GTA4 in 2007 debut on the 360 at the same time as PS3 Add to that better versions of the Tom Clancy games since the primary development platform is the 360 for those franchises Racing Got the sequel to the acclaimed Forza Motorsport Finally what better way to end 2007 than with Halo 3 If you simply must have the new Metal Gear and Devil May Cry the PS3 is for you I am tired of those games not to mention Final Fantasy XIXXIXV The 360 offers what I see as the best gaming experience refreshing new titles sequels to legacy Xbox titles amazing graphical power and the most comfortable controller on the market Not only that it s cheaper to boot 
Just BLOWN AWAY Wow I don t know why I didn t buy one sooner Xbox Live is by far the best feature Gears of War and Oblivion are amazing I don t have a high def tv and was still surprised at how good the graphics are If you want an online gaming powerhouse get this The PS3 s Blue ray player is tempting but for 600 its not worth it Plus it has really weak launch titles 
Good game I got this for my son for Christmas We all have played and enjoyed it My son just loves it 
Incredible fun Just got this game for christmas excellent graphics and such lots of fun feels like the movie The only thing I don t like is that I get frustrated when I get stuck somewhere I m anxious to go on and see what else this game has in store I recommend this game 
Surprise surprise a game as good as the movie I had rented the game for a week and enjoyed it greatly Fluid animation and great sound gave the plot and levels the firepower to stay true to the movie The boss s were a bit predictable however I saw nothing but a solid game Recommend for the whole family 
Gradius meets Pokemon Those looking for a fast paced side scrolling shooter will not be disappointed Those who value their free time away from video games should look elsewhere R Type Final offers a rewarding shooter experience provided you challenge it on Human normal difficulty or higher It s hardly worth playing on the lower settings due to a lack of any real challenge This game offers 101 different ships you can play with Unlocking them is both rewarding and aggrivating Everytime you unlock a high powered ship you ll enjoy exploring its capabilities in battle However the novelty only lasts for one play through at most On the other hand the flight time you have to log with a particular ship to unlock new ones can be truly absurd Sometimes you have to log over TWO FULL HOURS of flight time in a ship to unlock a new one The battle mode is interesting and challenging in its own way though I honestly would have preferred the inclusion of a two player mode While R Type Final is by no means perfect it s a rewarding experience for those looking to relieve the heyday of side scrolling shooters Just anticipate loosing many many hours of your life to unlocking new ships 
R Type the legendary spaceship shooter R Type the legendary spaceship shooter has come blasting back with her classic horizontally scrolling blueprint intact Through waves of alien miscreants you ll fight for each gained inch of space battlefield while collecting power up items to enhance your ship s most primary weapon the Mighty Orb Of Death With R Type s trademarked invincible sphere docked to the front or rear of the ship MOOD can unleash deadly firestorms upon foes or be hurled forward to attack remotely and smash through most anything it comes in contact with Though the gameplay is classic the graphics have been updated to polygons thereby qualifying for a Sony of America license with lots of glowing lighting effects flowing gracefully over them Most enemies are basic spaceships but some levels have well animated living creatures like the badass water worm things that slither though level 2 Sadly even with crazy alien monsters uber weapons 100+ ships and giant bosses R Type is a rather unexciting shooter The MOOD is a shield against nearly all projectiles so most levels are spent calmly avoiding being pinched between narrow passages and otherwise harmless enemy trains Not a befitting task for humankind s last hope 
AWESOME GAME MECHANICS Other than r type for SNES I ve never really played muuch else in terms of the series However I m glad to say that I purchased this one for PS2 Graphics and control aside I think it s the game mechanics which make this such a fun game The basics from the original are essentially the same you fly a ship around blastng your way through hordes of enemies in an endless assault of lasers and obstacles However what set this baby apart from the rest is your weapon system You have an attachable bit on the front of your ship which can be released allowing you to place it on the front or back of your ship or just let it roam about This means you can fire behind you Pretty cool Plus the bit itself absorbs most bullets so it can be used as a shield which after absorbing enough energy allows you to unleash a large explosing type shot Coupled with charged shots customizable bits and missiles there s a lot of room for technique Plus there are 101 different ships you can you use each with their own weapons systems and bit and missile selections which can be surprisingly unique so you won t run into problems of redundancy Other than the difficulty and sometimes slow pacing of the game not to mention the slow down issue at times this is a must buy for all shooter fans highly recommended 
A Delight A challenging game with hundred of ships several hidden bonus levels several endings several levels of difficulty a new versus mode great gameplay excellent graphics and a decent soundtrack This one is a worthy sequel to R Type Delta for the PS1 and it also holds its own against Square s classic Einhander 
I almost blew this game away Literally Ok Now I know I m not the brightest star in the sky but whodathunk that when the game calls for you to blow while stewing or boiling something that you are actually supposed to blow into the mic I failed at so many recipes just because I didn t know what to do when the recipe called for blowing Yes I know what you are saying Did you read the instructions before you played the game Of course not This game appears juvenile and primative but it has proven to me at least to be the most advanced NDS game to date Even if you don t enjoy puzzle games or you are a Teen Mature gamer this game is worth owning just to experience the full capabilities of your DS I d hate to know what the Mature Game Developers are doing with this whole blow thing Yuck 
Fun even for older kids Hi I am 11 yrs old and my next door neighboor s little sister got a pink nintendo lite She is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday With the nintendo ds lite she recieved cooking mama I started to play it and it was really fun It is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food My favorite is making the pizza and beef stew 
Fun but where s the beef Cooking Mama is esentially a series of cooking mini games strung together to form recipes for dishes It s an enjoyable game but it lacks enough depth to be truely replayable When enjoyed casually I think this game could last a while but aside from these dishes there is little else to do I found myself wanting to unlock more than recipes to find new ways of using my cooking practice One way this game could have easily been made a classic would have been to add some competitive play to it How about Iron Chef matches or Wi Fi tournaments But there s not much to this game once the novelty wears off which for me was about 6 hours later I ve come back to it casually but not for more than a few minutes here and there It is however well worth the 20 price tag 
Kitchen Madness I won t say that Cooking Mama is the best game I ve played in recent months Surely there s something more important than cooking like killing zombies on the X360 for example However it s certainly the most innovative especially when you consider how much you can do on the limited dimensions of a Nintendo DS touch screen In Cooking Mama you re an apprentice in the fine art of cuisine management Your master a certain Mama will put you through a series of saliva inducing recipes and will grill you through the preparation of each as if it s the only thing you live for You can choose to practise before hand but when you go into the actual process of making a particular food you ll find that there s no room for error A wrong move and Mama will not hesitate to show you her wrath Making a food involves several steps Some are short while some may take forever For example when preparing a pan fried fish you ll have to go through the coating of the fish slices the melting of the butter the actual pan frying and the arranging of the plate Each process in turn involves different ways of doing things Coating the fish slices for example requires you to drag your stylus in a left right manner while touching the fish Melting the butter requires you to rapidly drag the butter in a circular motion when it s on a hot plate Pan frying involves a following the command on screen mini game that requires you to perform whatever Mama tells you to and so on The impressive thing here is that even though you re just stroking your stylus throughout the game s 70+ recipes you re essentially doing different things It s a bit like Trauma Centre from last year but instead of seeing body parts you re looking at food If you re more adventurous you can even combine recipes to form new ones which adds depth to the gameplay For a game as quirky as this it s understandable that it uses quirky graphics The presentation of Cooking Mama is light hearted and makes the hectic process of cooking to me at least much more enjoyable The music is a little weak even though it does have some nice variety But seriously graphics and audios are not what you d buy this game for I mean who cares about these things when you ve Fried Octopus Balls to make For its sheer audacity in bringing the kitchen onto the DS I d recommend Cooking Mama to every owner of the DS Don t expect to see your DS in a few weeks however if you bought this game and have a missus in the house Now if only my wife can learn a few tips out of this 
Better than Madden I just got this game last night and I am amazed EA Sports really delivered with this one The Race for the Heisman mode is simply amazing All the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing The game is probably the best football game i have ever played Definately a must have for any Football Fan 
Great Game I had never purchased an NCAA football game until this one and I must say that I am happy that I did I love the college feel that it brings to the table Playing the Texas and Ohio State game in the Horseshoe with the crowd going nuts and the screen shaking was awesome I see that a lot of people are complaining about the fact that throwing long passes is just too easy but I have to ask if anyone ever watches college football on Saturdays This is exactly what happens week in and week out in college football Reason being is that there are more than twice as many talented wide outs than there are corners in college football and I feel that that is accurately portrayed in this game I don t have any gripes with this game except for the fact that in the rush for the heisman mode you are the automatic starter no matter what program you go to and you don t have the ability to change the depth charts except for when the game is about to start and you have to do this before every game All in all this is a great game and because of it my Madden 06 disc is collecting dust on my entertainment center 
Now everyone has a reason to go to college NCAA Football 2006 captures the college atmosphere extremely well The game is loads of fun The load times are decent the Dynasty mode adds tremendous replay value the Quest for the Heisman is a pseudo ripoff of NFL 2K series Crib feature I still love this game I even like the music It doesn t bother me that Lee Corso s and Kirk Herbstreit s commentary is repetitive The only thing I take issue with is every year EA brags about the strength of the AI and yet you can run the option successfully hundreds of times while the computer controlled team struggles to find a defense capable of stopping you Maybe that is why some people prefer to play online opponents Let me wrap up This a great game The graphics are impressive and EA did a wonderful job here Buy it for your son buy it for your daughter or buy for yourself You will love it I wish I could provide a more helpful review Head on over to and read the wonderful review they gave this game That will be more helpful than anything I can contribute 
Very destructive This game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities You can even go the wrong way For me older adult it was fun to play with my kids but I found it repetitive and boring after a while Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game 
Not just for kids Comfortable w a few glitches I will firstly say that I am not in the pre teen average age range for GameCube but I still like this controller When I first saw it I thought it would be too small for my hands and that the button placement looked awkward I couldn t have been more wrong The controller fits comfortably even into my larger than average hands For XBOX I prefer the bigger older controller to the smaller Controller S and all of the buttons are within easy reach The controller is set up in a way that the controlls are very instinctive for most games It also allows you to roll your thumb from button to button allowing for smoother gameplay than on systems where you have to lift your thumb and press the buttons The R and L shoulder buttons on the controller are sensitive to the degree that they are being pushed allowing more versatile controlls than on PS2 for shooters racing games and a few others The control stick is comfortable and precise The C Stick is usually superb but in a few third party games I have found it awkward Because it is not the same size and shape as most control sticks it can be awkward using it as one The C Stick however performs admirably in Madden where I find it to be preferable to the XBOX and PS2 controllers The only quality issue that I have found with Gamecube is with the C Stick If you tend to slam your controllers on the ground or leave them to be sat on etc the C Stick sometimes breaks so that the system thinks that you are always pushing it upwards Overall a very comfortable and easy to use controller High quality manufacturing with one glitch 
Almost my favorite of the 3 main systems controllers I ve pretty much been partial to the Playstation controllers since I got my PS1 back in 1997 When I saw the Nintendo 64 controller I nearly puked The joystick in the middle didn t make any sense to me I looked at the GameCube controller and wasn t exactly impressed It looked kinda goofy asymmetric maybe Well when I finally picked one up I found that it fit my hands much better than the PS models This would be my favorite controller if Nintendo changed a few things 1 The Z button is too hard for me to reach 2 The C joystick and the D pad are in awkward positions Fortunately most games don t really force you to use these much but if you re going to put buttons on a controller make them all easily accessible Due to these flaws I can t really say it s better than the PlayStation s design They re probalby tied 
GameCube Controller GameCube Controller Jet Black I have use the Controller and it is ok I got it for the grandson to use and he is having fun with it 
Because you don t want to make your friends sick When I first went shopping for a second controller for my GameCube I admit I was looking for one that matched my Platinum Edition controller I couldn t find one that wasn t a Wavebird nothing wrong with a Wavebird the wireless controller that I know of but I was just too cheap to spend the extra 10 So I bought a black controller to match my TV Now that I think about it buying a different controller was a smart thing to do Why didn t I plan on that in the first place I spent part of the winter battling a cold or the flu at various times and I can t underestimate the importance of controlling the spread of viruses and bacteria Having different colored controllers makes it easier to remember which controller I ve been using in between nose blowing sessions When a housemate or friend wants to play GameCube as I lay suffering on the other couch I am able to croak out the words use the black one today Trust me I also have a phobia against third party hardware so it s good of Nintendo not to mention profitable for Nintendo to sell spare parts The most important things about a controller are does it fit comfortably in your hand and are the buttons easy to find and use The only thing I don t like is the placement of the Z button The cord is plenty long and the buttons are responsive enough I also like that they re color coded 
original will always work the best This is a great controller and it rumbles unlike the wireless one Yeah it WILL wear down with time but it is by far one of the better controllers because it doesn t ruin your GameCube and it s more durable that third party ones AKA those NOT liscenced by Nintendo I first had a third party GCN controller and for some reason it stopped my GameCube from reading discs I had to get it repaired If anything if you want a good controller don t go for third party stuff Go for the original like this as for one they last MUCH longer and two they don t ruin your hardware It may look plain but it would be better to have a plain working controller rather than a quickly defective pretty one Also the official wireless if good if you don t mind the lack of a rumble 
misunderstood This controller is great Nice feel and all But it does tend to move to one side on its own Many people think it is the controller but if you read in the manual it clearly states that when the gamecube is turned on with the joystick to one side that will be the base for the controller This can be fixed by simultaneously holding Y+X+START Great controller for an easy 5 stars 
Ah the DS I can still remember that Christmas morning when I was the happiest kid in the neighberhood first taking out my sleek shiny DS from the wrap of the box all clean shiny and new I remember first turning it on and watching it light up the intro screen making that sastisfying noise Ah the memories It was probally the best expirence with a new console even when I got my PSP on the very first day it came out Surely getting a new console is a joy Okay so this thing may not be as good as the DS Lite After all after getting your hands on the DS Lite it s hard going back to the first one I remember playing it too it was a joy and the stylus worked great Also this was a highly anticipated system second only to the PSP those two months were HELL for me ANyway the games for DS always were showing stregth While the racing games arent as good the DS offers game that you can get nowhere else IT has alot of killer exclusives from Brain Age to Castlevania to a brand new Zelda game to an updated 2 d scrolling classic The DS s touch screen isn t a gimmick if you use it right Sure there may be bad racing games but hey all those quirky games give this system alot of life The DS sadly isn t my favorite handheld b ut I give props to Nintendo for constantly pushing the envelope and giving us a one of a kind gaming expirence The DS will go down in gaming history for sure Bravo Nintendo 
Great portable game system My friend gave me his old DS when he bought a DS Lite This is a versatile system that can play both DS and Gameboy Advance games The touch screen feature is very nice While it cannot play UMD movies like a PSP a portable DVD player is better for that aspect This is worth buying for a kid or adult gamer 
Pretty good For roughly 30 bones this product is really good My only gripe is that the button text wears off Other than that it is absolutely great especially if the 360 is the center of your entertainment 
Input Problems no more HANDY DANDY REMOTE For all the people having problems with changing their t v s inputs let me help you In the near bottom right of the remote is a small rectangle shaped button that says two words below it CLEAR INPUT push that button and your input problems can be put to rest just make sure that the remote is set to be on your t v not your 360 So do not let the input problem persuade you not to buy this handy remote like other reviews have said if you use your 360 as a dvd or music player iPOD it comes in VERY handy to own this remote If you have some kind of huge entertainment center then it s not for you but what were you thinking anyway 39 99 for a remote that will solve all you entertainment problems come on Cash out the money there PLAYER 
fit my need perfectly lighted keys and ability to program to turn on my tv made this remote a perfect choice for me a must have for users who dont have a remote and watch dvd s on the xbox 360 
Essential for Media Center Extender functions I have more than 500 albums in my music collection including more than 650 artists While this is not the largest collection my friends have even much larger ones I find it extremely uncomfortable to locate a specific artist or album by using the regular game controller Even while using the limited edition media controller you would spend a lot of time locating specific media That s why I find extremely useful the alphanumerical keypad included in this control and it s also useful when changing TV channels Price is not high and it s well designed Highly recommended for MCX users 
In addition Since there are already several well written reviews already posted I just wanted to add one huge thing that they ve failed to mention This new version has an option for you to select and swap out different players in your party This has never been available in any other version Much like Final Fantasy III ff6 in Japan where you comprised your team from a pool of characters Final Fantasy IV Advance lets you take Palom Poram Cid Yang to fight on the moon if you d like There s also a new dungeon Cave of Trials in Mt Ordeals that requires you to take each of those characters to face a boss in order to unlock their powerful end game weapons Each of these weapons specific to each character I E you can t equip Rydia with Palom s dagger even though they re both black mages is ultra powerful and instantly makes them a worthy addition to your party especially Yang s well maybe not Edward lol Anyway I m sure that the vast majority of you who buy this game have played a previous versions and let me tell you that you will not be dissappointed New fight scene magic graphics better music reworked dialogue unique to this version and new areas will make you feel like you re playing a classic for the first time PS Playing this on the DS Lit 
Pleasantly Surprised There are numerous trends in the video gaming industry nowadays Those developers sure have become sophisticated One of the tactics has been to release classic games on their consoles and see if they can re milk the market This of course has come with mixed reviews and mixed successes Final Fantasy IV for the Game Boy Advance is a champion game Compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES version FF2 I believe this re make is slightly better due to the increased updated features of the game SquareSoft retooled some aspects of the game and added some nice features to please the classic RPG enthusiasts as well as the diehard Final Fantasy fans I like to think of FF4GBA as the upgraded version to the original program similar to downloading a patch for a PC game only of course it still remains a console game The major stand out benefit I gathered from this version of the game is that now the gameplay flows smoother into the Final Fantasy III version FF6 for you diehards that know the Japanese nomenclature That is the switching of the party members that was introduced in FF3 Also the unlocking feature where optional side quests result in more loot The last part of this review deals with the most important topic the cost benefit analysis The question is Do you want to enroll in this common tactic of the video gaming industry Is 30 worth the SNES FF2 patch Does having the portable version of the game albeit a great game meet your desires Probably for most of us we got rid of our old NES and SNES a long time ago I didn t they are right next to my N64 and GameCube A lot of us downloaded emulators a while back and now play these games on our PCs And I would venture to say that almost all of us who love RPGs don t even care about video game consoles anymore and have gone to PC more features in our games So my recommendation here is leave your impulses behind Yes Final Fantasy II and the FF4 GBA version are classic great wonderful games But nostalgia shouldn t cost this much or require special circumstances to be taken advantage of in my opinion Buy the game if you are a collector or have money to burn But always remember they can t take our memories away 
Awesome I grew up on NES and SNES so seeing these games with new graphics and some bonus features was a very nice surprise for me I had just as much fun playing through this game as I did playing FFII for SNES Fortunately there were some improvements made in the dialogue which made it much easier to follow and the characters a little deeper Square added in some items and extra equipment Also you have the option to switch between all the characters towards the end of the game which gives the game a new flavor There are some small bugs in it but most don t hurt the gameplay too much The only downfall of this remake is that they took away the weapon doubling cheat Thus no more stacks of 99 Excallibur swords for Edge to throw 
Even better than the original I just bought this game last month and have played all the way through it including the unlockable side quests I m not going to write much about the games story here there are plenty of other reviews for that already All I m going to write about is the game itself Anyway after playing all the way through the game I have to say that I like it even more than the original The script is much better and the music sounds much better on the GBA One thing that I particularly liked about this game was all of the new unlockables After beating the game you unlock a new dungeon to explore as well as a really cool music player If you go down to extra and select Music Player in the main menu you can listen to all of the tunes and melodies that you heard throughout the game My personal favorites include Hey Cid Rydia Theme of love Chocobo chocobo and Dancing Calcobrena The unlockable dungeon Lunar ruins is very cool To fully unlock every room in the dungeon you have to beat Zeromus once as each character After that you get to do some really cool extra tasks as each character I wont spoil them for you but just having them in the game highly increases the overall replay value of this game Now for the pros cons of this remake Pros It s the same old game that you used to love but with some cool upgrades and additions to game play New Quick Save feature allows you to save inside of dugeons and towns Some of the text from the old game has been fixed so now all of the magic spells aren t abreviated Example Meteo has been fixed to read Meteor Has new unlockable Music Player and side quest dungeon The music sounds much sharper on the GBA you can really hear the seperate instruments playing in unison This version has the old unedited script which is far more convincing durring game play Cons Unlike Final Fantasy Chronicles this game does not include Chrono Trigger They changed the sound effects for some of the moves and changed the names of some of the moves For example Meteor doesnt make that screechy noise anymore which I thought sounded cool and Nuke has been changed to Flare In battle there seems to be a lag in reaction time when pressing down the buttons You press the button but it takes a second to register the command 50 50 None of the graphics have been upgraded but if you re like me that doesnt really matter If you re like me and have already played Final Fantasy II for the snes or Final Fantasy Chronicles for the PSone buy this game It s well worth the price 
Older Game Better Than Any Newer Game Out There Counter strike Oh yes the pc game that seems like it was released 15 years ago is still the 1 online game in the world Thousands of people can write reviews on this game all having different opinions and views of the game But shall we look at the obvious for a minute After 5 years after the game was released Counter Strike is still the most played online game withstanding the ultimate test the test of time What other test of greatness can Counter Strike achieve Millions of people still play this outdated game opposed to the newest more advanced games To me that is a sign of perfection an achivement worth reconizing I am tired of people putting down Counter Strike The Graphics are bad the realism is overrated ect The game is older Accept the game for what it is It is still an awesome game that everyone should play and support So many times people simply look at the graphics of a game to make reviews or opinions on the game What ever happened to the most important aspect of games gameplay Counter strike has the best gameplay of any game ever made Period Newer games may hands down beat Counter Strike in graphics but will never even come close to the gameplay that the original Counter Stike has Its a truely incredible pc game I ve played the original Counter Strike since its beta Hours upon hours I have spent on this game and no other game will ever match the ultimate enjoyment of gaming than that of Counter Strike I still find myself after all these years in awe of the game Trust me I ve played Counter Strike Source Doom III Battlefield 1942 Call of Duty and Half Life 2 and I choose counter strike 1 6 over all of them any day of the week 
This Game Rocks This is the first time that I have owned a Madden football game I can t compare it to the other games but this one rocks I love the highlight stick and hit stick Pros Good graphics great commentary and very fun Cons If you challenge a play it never gets reversed It only gets reversed if the other team challenges Notice I have only 1 con so this game is a must get for Xbox 
Keeps getting better As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle Crazy as it may sound Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox PlayStation 2 or the GameCube With that in mind it s not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn t really push the envelope terribly far The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year s game but for the most part it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current generation consoles is beginning to wind down However for at least this last year the veteran player outraces the up and comer in the Xbox 360 version and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year s game out on the older consoles Madden NFL 07 brings back practically every feature that was in Madden 06 On top of that a number of new gameplay upgrades have been brought to the table the majority of which are available in all versions of the game By themselves none of these individual changes or upgrades is particularly game changing but taken as a whole they add a nice dimension of depth These features include the highlight stick a new kick meter and lead blocking controls The highlight stick is a new version of the truck stick used for runners on offense Here you can use the right control stick to pull off the sorts of crazy jukes and steps that star running backs are so well known for and on top of that depending on the type of back you re playing you can opt to use more powerful moves or more finesse based maneuvers This feels like the natural evolution of last year s truck stick though most experienced Madden players will be able to get by just as easily using the button based moves rather than making liberal use of the stick But if you take the time to learn the stick and figure out how to use it and the button controls together you can be a very hard runner to stop The new lead blocking controls are likely to inspire some new tactics from all types of players Here while on offense you can opt to switch your controlled player to any of the available blockers during a running play This includes offensive linemen tight ends fullbacks or whoever else might be blocking on a play When blocking you can just do standard blocks or you can even get dirty and do some mean spirited cut blocks This is an interesting mechanic because it stops you from having to rely on CPU blockers which as any experienced player will tell you are not always the most reliable players on the field You can also quickly switch back to control the running back once you ve laid down your block which is good because the CPU running back doesn t always manage to find the holes you re creating At first you may find yourself unable to effectively use this feature as setting up the right blocks isn t always the most intuitive thing in the world But after some time this control method gives the running game a really interesting new perspective and those who love finding new strategies are bound to eat this up The new kick meter is probably the most accurate representation of kicking available in a game thus far With this meter you use the typical arrow to line up your angle and then press down on the right analog stick to set up your power The meter quickly fills up and then you press forward on the right stick to set the power as well as your accuracy The accuracy is based on the angle at which you press up If you press too far to the right or left the kick will get away from you If you land it within a set space it will go pretty much right where you want it to Beyond that the changes from 06 to 07 are mostly ancillary and fundamentally the game plays very much as its predecessor did On defense there are a few more available options in terms of positioning your defensive players and you can commit your defense in a certain direction the moment the ball is snapped On offense the quarterback vision cone which made its debut last year is still available though it s not a required feature You can just tap the right analog stick after snapping the ball and it will pop on letting you use it for a little accuracy boost No it s not any more fun to use than it was last year but that s not altogether surprising Otherwise pretty much every control feature you ve come to expect from Madden is front and center once again Potentially some people could play through Madden 07 and never really partake in the new running control features but there s definitely enough in all the available upgrades to add a significant layer of depth to the experience Even though Madden NFL 07 doesn t have any big game changing features to make it an especially memorable iteration of the series its roster of small but useful changes are ultimately more compelling than anything Madden 06 had on offer last year And while some people are undoubtedly over the notion of playing new games on old consoles Madden 07 shows that it can still deliver some enjoyable football regardless of what platform it s on It s not a big step forward and the similarities between this year and last year might be a tough sell for some But it s those similar aspects that Madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor and if you skipped out on 06 then there s no good reason to ignore 07 
Not as user friendly as 06 I like it so far and I think the new features are going to be cool once I get better at them I just don t like that they made precision passing more complicated and they changed the kicking but I think I figured that out I beat the computer by 52 points so I guess I am doing okay never mind that I was playing the Texans ha ha I haven t really used precision passing though just gotten lucky on my passing for the most part I liked that it did it for me in 06 
Not the best Madden yet This years madden wasn t worth all this hype over I have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game Graphics are o k gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn t have the true madden gameplay as before It s just ok not super and semi dissapointing The things that caught me off guard was Vince Young and Reggie Bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right Overall i wasnt amazed Also the worst part is the new controls You need to use the right analog stick to juke spin and do shake n bake moves please agree with me people 
a blood soaked epic western storyline GUN is a hyped TPS it is devoped by the same team who brought us tony hawk the game takes place in the 1890 s in and during the old west near kansas in the begging the protraginst cole white a man who should be in the age range of 24 betwenn 29 is on a hunting game with his father which is the basic tourtoul the abord a ship that is attacked by indins the ship blows apart but cole survies after 3 days he wakes up at the edge of the lake or river or what not that is i will not spoil the rest but gun takes a lot if populrey elements and puts it in one game examples include slow mo shooting from max payne you can get this by nailing head shots or cool ways of killing it works with only pistols but with any other gun it would be to easy it also goes to A FPS in the 10 15 seconds you use this many mature aspects while always a conteversy it is also populry In GUN youll see a lot of it to blowing a guys head apart and watching brain and tissue fly while the corpse just sparys froming a puddle scalping is what has gotten this game contercovsly a sclap is when a person whos dieing on the floor get s a knife taken to to there neck it s excatrated to say the least also if you kill a person with a cannon there limbs fly so expect to see an arm or a leg after you blow up dynimyte of fire a cannon there is also the abilty to set a person on fire or stab them with a knife while the are 100 still alive and there idea of a epic cutscene is haveing a mans fingers being blown off slitting thorats shooting a man with a shotgun out a 3rd story window and sticking a rifle in a mans mouth and then pulling the trigger the language is not what is in GTA the wariors or the godfather but it does keep a consistent flow of S and B words the S word is used over a Dozen times if you play through the game the B word will be used almost 50 times the enemys death cry is commanly you B ch or Son of a B h FREE ROAM GUN features 100 free roam side missons included the map is not that big with only 2 citys but it is the old west with no cars or faster transportion then a horse and buggy but the horse is what you will be riding most of the time epic storyline the games story foucus on revange but interduces implyed sexul acts backstabbing twists hearing amazing things flashbacks ETC saying that the voice acting is also gold thomas Janes voice as colton and pretty much everbodys voice is done in true fashion the things to complain about in GUN is the lack of online and being short the main game takes about 8 to 10 hours to finish 
Not nearly as bad as everyone says it is I am scratching my head as to why everyone thinks that Gun is such a terrible game I bought it a few weeks ago at a reduced price and I really enjoy the game The graphics are quite nice the voice acting is really good and the gameplay itself is entertaining I really enjoy the open Western environment in the game Basically Gun is structured like a Grand Theft Auto game in that once you pass the first few missions you find yourself in an open environment that you are free to explore take up side missions or start the actual missions of the game Some of the side missions include ranching participating in the pony express working as a bounty hunter and arresting or killing fugitives playing Texas Hold Em at the saloon and hunting wild game Completing these missions will improve your characters abilities such they do tie in to the overall picture Gun features a Quickdraw mode of fire which is essentially the same feature used in Max Payne which slows down gameplay and allows you to make precise targeted shots Another feature I like about Gun is the fact that your character is able to buy weapons and items such as weapon upgrades to improve his overall strength You earn money through completing missions and side missions mining for gold and winning at gambling Many people complain that Gun is too short and that the overall story is not very in depth While there is some truth to this you should not pass up your chance to play Gun now that it is reduced to 20 In fact this game is actually a steal at 20 It is a much better game than people give it credit for 
With Gun it s a love hate form of relationship It s obvious Gun isn t for everyone I really enjoyed it as did a friend of mine but I ve read many reviews both on this website as well as elsewhere with thoughts that have been quite unlike my own I ve read that gamers thought the controls were too sinewy or that the storyline wasn t interesting enough or even that the Western genus alone isn t worth a game being made about it and personally I think that s entirely untrue Okay for one this isn t exactly the type of Western or even close to what you re familiar with regarding Clint Eastwood or John Wayne no this one is entirely different This is among the new breed of the Western genre that we ve never seen before where it more negates the predominant hero and focuses solely on the brutality that was the West Much like the HBO series Deadwood Gun not only brings us a vivid new creation into the eyes of an unsympathetic frontiersman with delightful mechanics such as riding horses firing bows and engaging in a more or less duel in the thoroughfare of whichever town you re in if you anger the townsfolk enough I think this sort of cruelty can not only be admired but enjoyed immensely if the right gamer will only give it a shot and get to know the controls The setting is fresh its many intricate greed driven plotlines causing for much distress for the lonely horseman and I think the music scored for this game only vitalizes the objective And two the sound which ties in with the game s score is just as powerful as it is heart warming I ve never enjoyed firing a six shooter so much in a game but granted there haven t been many opportunities for me to try one out which is another reason this game makes for such amazing gameplay it s never really been done before If given time I m sure I could come up with a few games that have been Western based but none as intriguing and tongue dissolving as Gun and I think even those who didn t like could agree with me on that In short it s just a beautiful game albeit with many areas that need improvement but overall plentifully satisfying There are a few issues though one the length of this game is dreadfully short With as many opportunities as this game was given I would think the creators would turn it into a twenty five or thirty hour game or at least give the gamer more sub missions to allocate his time to but in the end this game falls short of true masterful selection for those little tidbits that just didn t make the grain It was a great game for as long as it lasted but unfortunately that just wasn t very long With hope they ll create a sequel but I pray it ll be longer and much more enjoyable in that the horses will be as innate and fun to ride In all though I still say Gun was a supreme achievement I have enjoyed playing it and although it was incredibly short I still found it pleasant regardless because in the end playing the rugged protagonist that is only seeking revenge is often implemented in videogames but I can scarcely think of many that are better than Colton White well maybe Kratos from God of War 
Fun And Historically Detailed But Not Enough Places To Explore Gun is a Western themed game that features a young cowboy Colton White on the search to discover the secrets of his past The most impressive aspect is that the game is surprisingly detailed in its historical depiction of the Wild West For example the game shows the effects of railroad expansion on the American Indians while also including the Chinese coolies that worked on these railroads On the other hand the geography is way off as Colton can ride on horseback from Dodge City Kansas to Empire New Mexico in a matter of minutes Of course what really matters in a video game is how much fun it is to play and in this Gun receives fairly high marks The game is primarily mission based Colton must complete a variety of tasks both to advance the story line and to build up his stats through a series of side missions such as riding the pony express and catching outlaws I also enjoyed searching for gold mines However I wish the game allowed more free exploration For example the towns are full of buildings But it s really not possible to explore them except for the casino and a few others The game is also a little on the short side But still it s a fun gaming experience that s worth buying 
Great Rental Gun isn t a game that I would suggest you buy the reason is that it s pretty short You can probably finish it in a week The graphics are good and the sound is awesome on surround sound 20 weapons 30 upgrades good graphics hunting side mission lawmen side mission pony express side mission ranch hand side mission bounties side mission 44 gold to find enemies tear apart blood and gore poker tournaments not a lot of story levels interesting story interesting characters slow motion shooting with pistol 
Western Shootout I friends love Western themed games I must say this got me glued to the PS2 It is not fair to say it is better than Red Dead Revolver RDR had a lot of features that GUN did not Eg The slow motion gun showdown OK as for GUN The only two Cons are that is short Two It is relatively easy But please note there are 1 Variety of missions 2 Variety of cool weapons 3 Interesting Game story I only more games of that genre come out It seems to be popular Thanks Nawa 
BEST GAME SYSTEM SO FAR FOR ME NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT IT HAS THE GAMES I LIKE F E A R GEARS OF WAR DEAD RISING ETC AND THEY LOOCK AMAZING ON MY STANDARD TV VERY GOOD INVESTMENT REALLY FUN AND WORTH THE MONEY 
Just BLOWN AWAY Wow I don t know why I didn t buy one sooner Xbox Live is by far the best feature Gears of War and Oblivion are amazing I don t have a high def tv and was still surprised at how good the graphics are If you want an online gaming powerhouse get this The PS3 s Blue ray player is tempting but for 600 its not worth it Plus it has really weak launch titles 
The best overall package for next generation gaming I ve had my 360 since day one and it s been worth every dollar Let me start by saying there is NOTHING nothing that compares to Xbox Live on the 360 Microsoft knows online gaming they know the gamer By the end of the month you will be able to download High Def Movies for rent and tv shows for free The online community is set up to help guide you to gamers like yourself and people with your skill level Sony can t do this and Ninendo can t do this They will try but the Xbox has been doing this for years now starting with the original xbox As for the so called problems All systems have them in the first couple months of release it happenend to the Gamecube PS2 and as we are seeing the PS3 I do also want to mention that the poster who said not to put the 360 verticle does not have a clue You can put it verticle or horizontal and it works just fine As it turns out many systems were crashing because people got scared of the rumours and bought the nyko cooler It in turn is now being reported and back with pictures etc that IT was causing many 360 s to burn out and it had nothing to do with any 360 problems I personally have the 360 and soon a Nintendo Wii and I have to say in the overall scheme of things Games Online network options accessories etc You can t beat the Xbox 360 Not only that the sony hype machine wants to tell you that it s graphics are better In reality programmers and 3rd party developers are saying they are equal in graphical power but you are force fed lies and hype from the Sony side Not to mention a much higher price tag With all the bs sony and fanboys throw out there The 360 is a worthy buy You really can t go wrong with the 360 buy the premium and get the best game out there Gears of War 
Great Graphics Good Games but not bug free This is a Good system with great graphics and a number of good games Supports online multiplayer too with an xbox live subscription The only problem i have with the system is that sometimes it freezes i ve had it for about 5 months and it s probably frozen about 8 or 9 times which can be annoying esp when im in the middle of a game Other than that it s a good system 
Just plain fun We ordered this game because we had played the demo on another disc and we thought it was funny It has been a joy to play and lots of fun My two sons have enjoyed it inmensely Non violent no bloody scenes no fights the game is just fun for anyone I have even played it a couple of times and it seems like the kind of game to enjoy after a stressful day I recommend it 
Katamari love Our whole family plays this game We fell in love with the first Katamari game but it was frustrating trying to complete each subsequently harder level This game isn t like that Each level is different in its own right Some levels require you to roll faster some bigger some of them you have to gather as many of a certain item as you can find It is challenging without the frustration You can always go back and try to do better on each level find the cousin or the present that is hidden or you can continue on There is a two player mode also It s much more fun than the first Katamari Of course if you don t know the premise of the first game you might not understand the king s and the common peoples rantings but it s simple enough Roll around and get big with your sticky ball It s addictive 
Better than the First We Love Katamari does not have the wonderful music that the first game had but the levels have improved astronomically This game plays just like the first but there are even more things to find and more creativity with gameplay Every level has one present to find and one to four cousins to capture each We Love Katamari definitely makes Katamari Damacy seem repetitious How is this so Well mindless rolling will no longer get you the best score For example one level you have to make a katamari as big as you can with only 50 objects which is quite a difficult task in such a large area Another level that requires some serious searching is the money level In this level you pick up things to make more money not increase the size of the Katamari in meters Finding expensive jewelry early and other pricy objects is key to making a ton of cash There are many other interesting levels in this game but I think it d be best to leave them as a surprise Regarding the complaints about the short length of the game this is far from the truth The game is easier to beat than the first but it is still just as hard to make gigantic planets I ve spent hours trying to do my very best with each level I never got bored since most levels are very unique I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age My five year old nieces and nephews could not stop playing this game when they came over 
This game rocks It feels so strange describing this game to people who have never heard of it before Yeah you play as this tiny little prince and your father the King of All Cosmos got drunk one night and destroyed all the stars in the sky Your job is to go around the earth with this psychedelic sticky thing called a katamari and roll stuff up into a big ball Really that s all you do just roll as much stuff as possible into a massive ball and if it s big enough your gigantic well endowed father will shoot it up into the sky to become a new star And uh that s the plot WTF Yeah you just gotta play it And that s the best advice I can give What exactly is it that attracts me to such a bizarre game Perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion of mine to just roll things up into a ball I dunno it s just plain fun The controls are very simple you only use the left and right analog sticks to navigate through your brightly colored exceedingly cluttered environment What really adds to the enjoyment of this game is the sound Every object you pick up lets out a unique sound as it s unapologetically absorbed into your ball of junk and it s quite amusing Furthermore the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat and you re sure to get the songs stuck in your head for hours days weeks months lol I also love the fact that this title is enjoyable and playable for both gamers and non gamers alike The controls are quick to pick up and simple objective is easy to jump into Truly this game is just off the wall fun and if you re willing to try something unique with a healthy dose of craziness give this game a roll 
Excellent game Thought the first Katamari game was addictive This one is worse It s just like the other only you have more levels and different types of quests like cleaning up a room and rolling up 1000 cranes to help out a friend who is sick One of the best parts is you can play as any cousin you have found in a level and there are dozens more royal presents In fact you can wear 2 at once The King is still hilarious In fact every time you beat a major level you get a short little cut scene about his past You even get to hear him speak in Japanese at the end That was a huge treat for me Many people complain about the graphics I think the simple blocky graphics greatly suits the game It would lose its charm if the graphics were as good as a newer Final Fantasy game The bright colors funky sound and even funkier music just make this game adoreable while making you uttering over and over again What in the world There s only two complaints I have the multiplayer and the length of the game The multiplayer is still lacking there aren t many levels to choose from and it can get a little old after a while Also the game is relatively short I beat it within 3 days of playing it maybe 2 3 hours a day However this can easily be combatted with the side quests You still have to find all the royal presents sometimes there are more than one in a level cousins 39 in all there are 4 you have to find in one of the last levels and about 3 extra levels you obtain after you beat the game The ending credits is even a level This is why it loses one star it s really more of a 4 5 star In conclusion We Love Katamari is a GREAT game It ll have you hooked I reccomend it to anyone who can hold a controller That s the only skill you need to play it And a sense of creativity of course 
Look elsewhere This headset works very well If you re not used to the rubber in canal ear piece there are several other tips that are a bit less intrusive It has worked quite well in the limited amount of time that I ve used it on XBConnect But the price You could probably buy a similar Plantronics headset that would be compatable with a Communicator cartridge adapter which isn t included in this package you have to buy it seperately but not designed specifically for the Xbox for less than half this price I was very fortunate to find two at Circuit City as they were being discontinued recently for five bucks a piece Maybe Amazon will soon drop the price like everyone else 
Forgetable comfortness This microphone is so comfortable I forget I have it on sometimes I mistakenly wear it even if I m not playing an online game If the over the head type microphones bother you alot then you want this microphone It is also good for people with glasses as it won t knock them out of place I wear glasses and the regular xbox live mic always messed my glasses up With the Halo 2 headset it does not bother with my glasses at all Consider this microphone if you are bothered with the regular Xbox Live headset 
REMINDER this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you d be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks Chris 
Perfectly balanced and perfect noise auditory levels Having been working for the U S Air Force for some odd time the noise in a cramped jet cockpit with a 30 000 lb thrust jet engine just 20 feet behind you the noise is just too unbearable and they give us laboratory designed and tested earpices that REALLY help and might I add these things are perfectly balanced and have the perfect noise cancelling levels like the ones we get So if someone in your living room was talking to you everyone in the Xbox wouldn t hear but it only takes a soft voice for them to listen and instead of the garbled and echoy noise you get on the standard headset this comes out crisp and clean Also it comes with 4 interchangable earpieces Large and small of rubber and large and small of foam composition Now if it had big enough jacks I d bring this in the plane with me Believe me this thing is worth it s money and then some 
mech assault this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great 
Lots of fun This was a top notch game I really enjoyed playing it It was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter The good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time I was If you ve already played Halo and you re looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one 
mechassault live think you can beat me if you have Mechassault and an xbox live gamer tag try playing me i usually play capture the flag and my gamer tag is minor00 so if you see me be sure to challenge me to a game because this game rocks 
The Good The Bad and The Ugly This review is going to be based on 3 categories The Good The Bad and The Ugly The Good eye inspiring graphics and special effects Very impressive nightmaresh sound effects Very scarey game with lots and lots of heart stopping surprises The game will have you either jumping out of your seat or shooting up anything that moves or falls to the floor The Bad The game lacks a lot from the original doom series Over half of the original creatures from Doom 1 2 and Final doom are missing which is very disappointing The sound track along with the creatures did not resemble anything next to the original doom series except for the rocket launching Revenant and the Archvile Id software must have spent a lot of time designing those two unfortunently they forgot to add the rest of the creatures As for the Imp s I didn t have a clue to what those tall creatures with 8 eight eyes throwing fire balls at me were I didn t know what they were until I downloaded it on my PDA in the game What a disappointment A lot of the times while I was playing the game it seemed as if I was play Quake 2 or Half Life but not Doom Don t get me wrong about the game The game is a good game but they should have named it DOOM The Beginning instead of Doom 3 The Ugly No joystick or game pad support The only controller support is keyboard and mouse which will cause your left hand to get carpartunnel from constantly pressing the TAB SHIFT F W A S Q and D keys The game is way too dark A lot of the times you re shooting at open air and then turning the flash light on to see if they re dead or still walking around only to find out that they re behind you tearing you to pieces I heard a lot about people stating that the game caused their computers to slow down to a crawl I myself didn t have that problem My computer is 3 years old and what is even worse is I m running a video card that is 6 years old My system is an AMD XP 2800+ over clocked to be equal to an AMD XP 3200+ 640MB ram Diamond Monster Sound 300MX and an old 3DFX Voodoo 5500 with 64MB video ram It took me awhile to find the right driver combination for my voodoo card because 3DFX went out of business back in December of 2000 But anyway under the timedemo it states that I get 19 FPS but under actual game play I get 38 FPS in High Quality mode with a resolution of 1024x768 Go figure I can t use the Ultra High Quality mode because my Voodoo card doesn t support TnL Transform and Lighting and I can t tell the difference between High Quality and Ultra High Quality except Ultra Hight Quality runs slower By the way My video card and sound card are not direct X 9 0 compliant so don t believe everything that you read on the system requirements 
A very scary first person shooter Doom 3 is scary you literally spend most of the game in the dark and nightmarish creatures can come out of nowhere and try to kill you The environments look great and so does the character models The game is long but can be longer if you get lost However this game has a few flaws One and it s a big one is that you have to always carry the flashlight around because most FPS only have the character have one weapon on one hand at a time and have the other hand to be non existent you constently have to switch between the flashlight and a weapon So when it s dark and you have to fight you have to either hold a flashlight and keep whacking your opponent until it s dead or stay in the dark and shoot your enemy which you can have a hard time finding it the second con is that unlike Half Life 2 you can t really interact with much you can t grab certain objects and drop them or throw them And a final con which comes to one word Imps these are the most annoying enemy in the game you constently fight them and it can get annoying sometimes otherwise a game to get 
Scariest First Person Shooter This is one awesome game play it online or against the computer I do suggest online for more fun in the long run if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume definetely the scariest first person shooter out there 
LOVE this game I bought it several days ago and cannot separate myself from this game The graphics is amazing 
Good not that scary I ve bought this game for my new laptop like 2 weeks ago and the graphics are great The things that I really don t like about this game is that the controls are not that flexible compared to some FPS games because the most levels of doom3 is pretty dark and toggling between flashlight and weapon at the same time when the enemy appears is really tideous In fact the Quake4 is much more flexible in controls due to attached flashlight to machineguns and overall game interface This game is not that scary as long as you know the enemy s patterns of habit of appearing everywhere 
Blinx is great Blinx can be very time consuming for us older xBox players whom didn t grow up with a controller in our hands I found Blinx to be fun entertaining and challenging Even though it is rated for younger children I think the strategy involved is for older children teenagers and some of us adults For anyone wishing to have some fun have to think a bit Blinx is for you 
I was blown away by this phenom of a game When Blinx first came out all the reviews didn t really know what to make of it They said that this is one of the most innovative titles to come out in the past few years but then they started going on about how hard it is and how it gets repetitive in that you go through each stage clearing enemies to proceed Well what game isn t repetitive You could just as easily say all you do in Tetris is line up blocks or all you do in Mario 64 is collect stars And reading about the time controls sounded so confusing I didn t think I d be able to handle a 10 minute time limit in each level while controlling time So just a week ago I got Blinx and couldn t wait to see how it played after countless love it or hate it reviews from numerous people After watching the cool little intro and breezing through the first 2 worlds that night I saw nothing wrong with this game And the only people that will have that much trouble with this are those who only play rpgs or sports games and don t give platformers a try The time control is nothing to worry about either it s very simple to understand and actually you don t have to use time controls that often The main story of Blinx is short and to the point Which is good because I m really sick of games spending 15 minutes on intros just to tell you this is what s going on in a pointless FMV Blinx has a quick 3 5 minute intro showing you that he s part of millions of Time Sweepers time custodians that clean up any problems with time on different planets But suddenly something goes wrong on one of them and a princess is kidnapped Blinx sees her and gets determined to save her and the planet You go through 9 worlds in each world except the last there are 3 levels one shop and a boss at the end to get her back In each level you collect time crystals to gain time powers and sweep use your Sweeper vaccum cleaner garbage to take out all the enemies in a level to proceed to the next It s actually very fun and I never got tired of it Sweeping up different objects deals different damage to enemies A garbage can or flower pot won t do a whole lot but a beat up jaloppy piano or even a 16 ton weight now there s the real damage Time crystals are all over the place and you gain a time power by collecting 3 or 4 of the same type Getting 3 of one kind and 1 of any other gets you one power but getting 4 of the same time crystal gets you two of that power The powers you can use are rewind fast forward pause record and slow motion and hearts gain you a retry If you haven t figured it out from other reviews yet it s kind of obvious when you need to use some of the powers Like if you see a bridge fall down use rewind and watch it rebuild itself to cross And if you can t walk up a river that s pushing you back rewind it so you can walk up with ease If there are two switches you need to activate record yourself jumping on one while you jump on the other and open the door s The main ones you ll be using though are pause and slow motion mostly because these work on anything even the bosses Yeah people go on about how hard the bosses are I guess they didn t figure out how to use time powers But the last boss oh man That guy took me at least a total of 9 hours to beat I just beat him this morning at 2 59 49am yes I got the exact second and flipped out I was proud of myself He s up there with Pocky Rocky for SNES s last boss It s like the developers got mad at something and put all the difficulty into him Because the rest of the game is pretty easy until that part And as a side note I love how the ice levels are actually ice Not that magical non slippery ice they have in other games Here you pretty much skate on the floor and if you go too fast or hit a wall you fall over and get back up It s the small things like that that make me love this game even more Graphically Blinx is stunning for the most part Remember 10 years ago when you saw screens for Donkey Kong Country and were impressed by the models That s what I got here Blinx himself has some of the best graphics I ve ever seen See how he looks on the box That s exactly how he looks in game You can see the fur on him when he s up close and they got every single detail down perfectly Every level also has just as much detail there are no bare areas at all There s always something going on And of course I can t leave out the water Everyone seems to be impressed with that no matter what they think of the actual game Try slowing down time and running through a river canal Or pausing it to see the trail left behind The developers did a fantastic job Unfortunately some of the enemies don t have as much detail as Blinx does A lot of them are just one colored shapes that didn t really require much effort to create But then there are some that are really cool in design So it s a little mixed bag there And that last boss man I won t even start on that thing There s no slowdown unless you re blasting tons of garbage at enemies without stopping The only other slowdown is when you make it happen It appears to run at 30 frames a second and there s nothing wrong with that I really enjoyed the music too and would love to get a soundtrack The main theme if fun and enjoyable and the first level contains the most magical music I ve ever heard The rest of the game has good music always fitting the mood of the setting The final boss music really puts you in the mood to take em out it s full of energy and concentration Sound effects are cartoony but that s not a bad thing When blasting garbage and an enemy you get a zany little effect that sounds like something from Tom Jerry Voices however I m confused They re not bad In fact Blinx has great delivery and voice acting for not having much of a personality he s a platformer character He doesn t need personality But I could ve sworn they spoke Japanese in the beginning I know for a fact I translated some of the words meaning what the text on the screen meant But at the end I didn t understand a single thing I guess they made up their own language here just like they had in Panzer Dragoon Orta But there isn t a lot of language going on just the belts from Blinx most of the time Though he does say some things in English once in a while I noticed Yay and Burned kitty food when he got knocked out and into a lava pit Keep an ear out for what the pigs say when you hit them with garbage whenever they show up in a level I swear the one you fight most of the time goes You suck when he gets hit It s pretty intimidating to hear that even if you re winning Blinx didn t disappoint me at all It has tons of replay too You get a rank when you complete a level and if you get all A+ or S+ ranks you get a cool treat Plus there are cat medals in each level that add to little bonus clips The first few are pretty lame but as you get more they turn out to be great Going back and figuring out new ways to beat bosses is always fun too I just can t stress how much I love this game On my shelf I put this ABOVE Knights of the Old Republic and Jet Set Radio Future But right behind Panzer Dragoon Orta From what I ve heard the demo for the sequel I m amazed this thing did well enough to get a sequel is even better Blinx 2 will probably be the first Xbox game I get for full price and when it comes out So get this if you re looking for a little bit of an old school feel with superb graphics and quality and of course fun And that s all that matters in games having fun 
Diss it or hit it Blinx is a very exciting game to play In the beginning it was very confusing but shortly I learned how to play This game is very challenging colorful and long But I have to admit I really enjoy playing this game The graphics are awesome Just marveously awesome 
Overpriced here on Amazon Don t spend the 60 someone is charging for this Just go to Best Buy and buy the package for 20 LO 
good stuff i was so excited over this package 4 games in one and all of them got pretty good reviews online so i checked it out AWESOME this package is definatly worth the money Black and White is a very unique game that ive spent hours playing Freedom Fighters is amazing i loved the squad aspects and the action LOTR is very cool but i have some framerate problems even tho my comp exceeds the recommended requirements the only reason i gave this package a 4 is because medal of honor doesnt work on my computer and tech support did not help at all I ve heard good things about MOH so if it happens to work on your computer then that just makes this deal even better This is a great package and i recommend it to all i got all the cd keys for all the games so the other reviewer who did not must have just been unlucky 
Great value for the price I ordered this set primarily for LOTR Return of the King but after I got it it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it But I was able to play the other three games and I really enjoyed Freedom Fighters and Medal of Honor Black and White was okay but I wasn t able to get into it But it should be noted that with Black and White you get both the original game and the expansion pack Creature Isle So you are really getting five games instead of four So I highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good but not so modern games and spend little money 
for all those Pacino Fans this is Quake Meets GodFather meets GTA Folks anyone been waiting to witness PACINO style violence this is it I just got this game and it rocks i need to sleep i haven t slept in 24 hours its too cool all RAGE all the time and heavy tommy gun like gun The fact the game takes place after the movie ended is incredible the only reason i gave it a 4 because i thought they could have borrowed more camera movement and direction from GTA or the God father engines The graphics and backgrounds are stunning I spent a good time on the ocean and beautiful oceans of yester Florida Coast 
Its an okay game But I miss freedom and flexibility Scarface The World Is Yours Vivendi Games was one of the most hyped videos games of 2006 Following the success of the Godfather game people couldn t wait to get their hands on the Scarface game especially when some reviewers said it was as good or better than the Grand Theft Auto Games The game takes on a what if scenario i e what if Tony Montana didn t die at the end of Scarface but instead loses everything and has to rebuild his empire First I will start off with an important matter player control and movement In comparison to past Vivendi Universal games I will say that the player control and movement is very good Next up weapons I personally felt like the aim and shooting ability could have been vastly improved According to the tutorial you press L1 to target and R1 to shoot but they failed to mention you must use the analog stick to aim your weapon Maybe you don t maybe it was just me this isn t in the instructions but I found more success when I used the analog stick in conjunction with the L1 and R1 As the game begins you are in your mansion facing a hail of gunfire from enemies At the top of your balcony you must shoot enemies Then came my first moment of oh this isn t as much of a free world at Grand Theft Auto when I tried to descend the left side of the staircase I couldn t get down it It s like there was an invisible forcefield Perhaps you need to kill a certain amount of enemies before you can descend down the left stairs I made my kills and then descended down the right side of the staircase to take on the remainder of the enemies There is a function named blind rage that comes out when you press a button on the controller This function makes Tony temporarily invincible When he dies on the screen it says You f cked up That is just one example of the cursing in the game The F word is used so much in this game that as an adult I wish there would have been a filter to change the language setting I literally had to play the game on mute because of all of the foul language Scarface The World is Yours is a fun game if you like violent games I will point out that as a gamer Rock Star Games has spoiled us terribly In Scarface The World Is Yours you pretty much have to stay on the mission or there isn t much to do In the past five years the Grand Theft Auto series has given us the ability to perform street races visit the shooting range import vehicles gamble dance work out or just walk around and mess things up when we aren t on a mission In Scarface The World is Yours you basically have to stay on mission There isn t too much extra to do when you aren t on a mission Sometimes as game player I get tired of shooting so much and just want to take a break and do something different I strongly suggest buying the Prima Games strategy guide It definitely unlocks the full potential of the game Scarface The World Is Yours overall is a fun game but it still doesn t give the game player that total free open world experience that some of the GTA games do But yeah get the strategy guide it gives the player something to look forward to 
Brilliant Use of the New Wii First off this game s graphics are not mind blowing They are very good but they are not as beautiful as the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3 That said that is not the reason that you buy this game The game has amazing replayability because of it s amazing controls and fun factor You turn the Wii remote on its side and use it as a steering wheel When on a massive jump use the steering wheel to change your pitch and land safely Perfect landings are met with speed boosts Playing this game with friends is a blast Your friends will be wowed by the controls and then wowed by the fun they re having I have played several of the Wii games already and this is my favorite Must buy 
Sims2 Overall rating The continuation of the Sims2 game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack The smaller expansions in between the big ones ie Glamour life stuff and or Holiday mini pack are good in my book because I get tired of the same decor and clothing after a while It s nice to get fresh things Although EA could just bundle those small expansions in with one of the bigger ones like Sims2 Nightlife or Sims2 Pets for examples Regardless I still love the Sims2 and I look forward to more enhancements in the future 
Doggies and Cats and Sims Oh My I have all the Sims and Sim s 2 products and each one is more fun and more involving than the last The addition of pets and the abilities to create custom pets is very amusing and it adds a whole new dimension to the game The new items that are included in the Glamour Life expansion set are great additions to the game as well 
No new Kitchen Stuff kidding right No it s not a joke This is the first expansion pack I ve bought for Sims 2 and that was my first thought as I was trying to find all the new stuff it adds It does add some nice things mostly couches chairs art tables beds and clothes and some new colors of shag carpeting which are awesome I also like the new dresses and the dressers The original Sims 2 just offers those space guzzling amoires Another addition you ll see is you can now influence people to do things It made my game immediately run slower then before but I m sure it s nothing that cleaning my hard drive won t cure As other reivewers have suggested it s a nice pack but overpriced right now 
Pretty Good Game Except For A Few Modes This game is great I mean it might be just like last years game and all but still it s pretty cool I like the graphics They don t show great detail but they suffice The new momentum meter is nothing special It doesn t help you or anything It just tells you who s doing better in the game The new emotions expressed by the players really helps you to know the tempo of the game One thing that is sort of a CON this year is the Campus Legend mode That s really the only reason I bought this game I really don t like a college football team well enough to have a franchise with it I do like CSU though so I might try it But anyway Campus Legend mode lets you do the normal thing Pick your position for instence You get to do lots of drills for your position this year Good to some bad to most Also you have to pick a major to do WHAT S UP WITH THAT I mean college football is rough enough but to have to study for a major UNBELIEVEABLE Then they expect you to remember all of the stuff you studied and take two tests on it each year I got so frustrated that I was failing chemistry that I started to write all the answers down So I m doing better now Trust me though this game is fun to play random games with your college team or a guess a franchise with your favorite college team but please if you want to make an all star football player just go out and but NCAA Football 2006 Way more easier 
Still the champ As far as football games go over the last 3 or 4 years NCAA football has been the best This year so far is no different I got the Madden and haven t even started the season yet because it comes out so early none of the rosters are anywhere near close I play with the Cowboys and had to create 8 players Also the gameplay for Madden is so unrealistic a linebacker can intercept everything To me since about 2003 NCAA has looked better and played much better than Madden The players on Madden look so little for some reason You can control your players alot easier on NCAA The trick to the momentum meter on this game is to try to get a good lead early and after that it is alot easier One thing I dont like about this game is that for the past 2 years they have taken off the special intro s to add all that other junk See i play with Miami and they always run thru smoke at the beginning but they took it out 2 years ago why Also they used to show Notre Dame walk down their stairs but they took that off too Also for the last 2 years I havent won the heisman even though I had better stats Other than that the game is solid haven t played the Superstar mode yet For football fans this game is worth a buy 
A GREAT GAME BUT NOTHING IMPROVED Basically if you like 04 05 And 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics I Like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it Remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it This is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge 
Guitars Trumpets Tubular Bells Whistles and yeah GUNS Years ago when I saw the coming soon posters for this game I passed because of Rockstar s rep in the Grand Theft Auto genre I didn t want to patronize a company exploiting the deperate parts of inner city life Then I found out Red Dead Revolver had an authentic okay lifted spaghetti western soundtrack That was the dealmaker for me If you like the music of the films get it get it get The dwarves are just gravy to the story and the music 
Western Gaming at it s best Red Dead Revolver is by far one of the best Western games I ve ever played The game has an easy learning curve also After an hour or so of play you will have all the controls down and you ll be hooked or otherwise very interested It has one of the best story lines out of any other games I know Basically a Western tale of revenge on a renegade Southern General and his Colonel You play as Red Harlow whose father was brutally murdered right in front of him by Colonel Darien again General Diego s right hand man I wouldn t say this game is as bad as the rating makes it There is no actual dismemberment as the rating for Blood and Gore says and the use of curse words is kept to a minimum If you ve seen any PG 13 Rated movies the two could relate It s a fun time killing game if you re bored with great replay value for people who don t plan on finishing the single player modes There are tons of characters to choose from in the multiplayer mode both good and bad The multiplayer modes are numerous also including things like Showdown and Dueling modes The downfalls of this game are the short Story mode and the overall simpleness of it There aren t many ways you can get creative with it But the greatest thing about it I believe is The sheer Hilariousness of it Me and a friend sat and played it for more than 4 hours at night once and sat holding our sides crying because of laughter The midget clowns and the character reactions are funny Especially how it sometimes glitches up Once during a boss fight with a very fat character the fat enemy got hung in a stairwell because he was too big to go through it An Overall VERY GOOD game You should buy this and if you like this game you may want to purchase GUN too GUN copied off of Red Dead Revolver for the most part though Both games have very short stories too If you like a good Western and great replay value then you will certainy love Red Dead 
Entertaining highly amusing but too short This game was a long time in the making and given the cultural popularity of the Western genre it is surprising that a Western themed video game should take so long to come to market I had this game for a long time but only recently got to play it and when I finally got into it it was enormously entertaining and I loved a lot of the spaghetti western themed humor and musical score In the game you will control a variety of characters many of whom are introduced in the superb opening sequence which plays much like the opening credits of a Sergio Leone western Most of the time you will play the part of Red Harlow a half breed bounty hunter on a mission to hunt down his parents murderers Sound familiar You ll also get a chance to control a variety of other Western archetypes such as the expert pistoleer English dandy the sharpshooting spitfire rancher s daughter the Indian cousin of Red Harlow who dresses like an Iroquois instead of a Sioux or other Plains Indian but I m nitpicking the Negro Buffalo soldier and you even get to play a bad guy when you assume the role of a renegade Mexican general The gameplay itself took a little time to get used to For instance to draw your gun you must press a button down and keep it held down while pressing another button to shoot If you let go of the button which draws your gun your character will holster his gun again This was one of the quirks which made for an initially difficult learning curve However once the controls are mastered combat is actually surprisingly easy You can duck hide behond cover dive roll and jump When guns are holstered you can even punch and kick and one of my favorite sequences in the whole game is the bar brawl more stereotypical western scenes where you cannot use your guns but must use fists and feet and occassionally broken whiskey bottles to fight your way to safety In addition to normal combat there is a showdown mode which is dedicated to quick drawing against one or more opponents The highlight for this feature is a tournament which seems inspired by the movie The Quick and the Dead where you battle ever faster enemies until you win This mode is sometimes very frustrating as you may have to replay again and again Overall the graphics are okay what helps make this title is the fact that the makers put in a grainy old style matinee look like the game was a movie being played on an old style and worn out projector complete with hairlines and picture moving off center at times This little touch was very endearing While this title may not have a lot of replay value it s still immensely fun and I would recommend it highly 
Really genious idea The idea for a spy game was great and the game itself was extremely fun only it locked a lot It s not the easiest game but I liked it a lot 
Splinter Cell An excellent game You are in a darkened corner You watch as a patrolman descends the stairs You size him up noticing his AK 47 is drawn You quietly sneak up behind him and when he stops walking you grab him You place your silenced pistol up to his forehead and drag him into a darkened corner Another guard walks into the room You quickly turn your pistol towards him shoot then turn back to your hostage You quickly hit him in the back of the neck knocking him out This is a great game It was made in I believe 2001 and yet the graphics rival that of games such as Halo 2 The physics of the game are amazing and it is very well programed Your guns drop shells which stay on the ground breifly and bullets leave holes on walls Guards will notice you if you are too loud and if their comrades are sniped they will sometimes open fire even not knowing where you are You can knock out kill or avoid enemies The graphics like I said are amazing The fire looks very realistic and the lighting is perfectly done People look realistic not quite so much as the scenery but even in games like Halo 2 people are not the focus Missions change greatly and environments change with them The dialouge isn t great but it is decent and if you dont play too close attention to it it is a nice backround noise All in all if you have one game to buy buy this one 
The amazing stealth action game that started the revolutionary Splinter Cell series Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is an amazing game that has completely changed the way people look at video games but also the stealth action genre for that matter The game is truly too good for words the only word that is even good enough to describe it is masterpiece That is truly what it is a masterpiece because of its seamless integration between stealth tactics and adventurous action There are no other games in the genre that offer the style of gameplay that Splinter Cell offers It is a unique gaming experience that you have to play to believe The core gameplay at the heart of Splinter Cell is revolutionary a style that has never been put into a game before The game puts you in the boots of American super spy agent Sam Fisher As Fisher you will go deep behind enemy lines to operate in top secret covert operations You must remain hidden and not be seen or captured otherwise the U S government will claim no knowledge of your existence As you gain experience operating as a super spy you will soon learn that opening fire on enemies and making noise will only cause an alarm to be raised which will simply put all your enemies on high alert and will probably get you killed soon enough So instead of run and gun gameplay Splinter Cell forces you to use stealth tactics which pretty much means to stick to the shadows and avoid being seen and if you must kill your enemies to complete your mission objectives be sure to do it silently In order to silently eliminate enemies you must sneak up to them without making noise Then after grabbing them you will have the option of interrogating them or forcing them to cooperate with you and then you can either kill them or knock them out It seems like a simple concept but it is a lot harder than it seems You won t just be able to blaze through levels and complete your objectives in a matter of minutes The missions are extremely challenging and you will end up replaying missions again and again In order to survive you must learn how to operate silently and in the dark without being seen or detected This is when Splinter Cell s stunningly amazing graphics come in handy Not only are the characters in the game each meticulously detailed to have ultra realistic physics and true to life animations but the environments are extremely realistic and full of life The shadow effects are one of the main highlights of the game Not only are they there for looks but they are actually directly integrated into the core gameplay They are actually a necessity for your survival as they help you remain hidden and invisible to the enemy Overall the graphics are stunningly amazing and look unbelievably realistic and extremely true to life The sound is simply icing on the cake It brings the amazing gameplay and the stunning graphics to life Ubisoft has always been a company known to take full advantage of Dolby 5 1 and Splinter Cell is no exception especially in surround sound The game shows off every single sound from Fisher tip toeing in the dark to the pop of your silenced pistol to the pounding of enemy fire being shot at Fisher it is all simply unbelievably realistic At first I was skeptical at purchasing this game because I didn t think I would like its stealth based gameplay considering I was more of a Halo fan But much to the contrary I had absolutely no problem paying 50 for this game when I purchased it when it was first released because of the hours of enjoyment I got out of it and the hours of fun I still get out of it today The bargain price of anywhere from 10 to 20 is definitely worth the money Even though there aren t a whole lot of features in the game besides the outstanding single player campaign it is still definitely worth the money considering how many hours of enjoyment you will get out of Splinter Cell Splinter Cell has an amazing story running throughout the campaign It really pulls the action together and really makes it worth playing You will find yourself tearing through missions just to see what s going to happen next in the story This makes Splinter Cell one of those rare addicting games that will never leave your Xbox console until you complete it Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is a unique experience that no other games can compare to It s truly a one of a kind game that is so revolutionary in its gameplay that I can honestly call it a masterpiece With the stunningly amazing gameplay combined with its extremely realistic graphics and it s true to life sounds Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is an amazing stealth action game that has changed the way people look at video games 
Really Fun Game Very good stealth type game This game is really addicting and keeps you playing Its a really intense game and gets harder level by level One of them games where it makes you think you gotta think what your next move should be Like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it should you take them out Or sneak past them Alot of stuff like that Hands down a really fun game 
A fun but somewhat buggy game This is a pretty decent looking Diablo style RPG game that adds another chapter to the game Sacred In Underworld you explore more areas farther north in the world of Ancaria I found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore rather difficult and a little confusing but there are interesting new quests and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters the Dwarf and Demoness The original Sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the Underworld epansion pack 
Sacred underworld delivers I bought this after it had been out a year so not as much available on line as there was a year ago also it is a German game so limited USA playing But I loved the first Sacred I also loved Sacred underworld if you don t plan on on line playing Sacred is worth the money 
Sacred Underworld More of same but bettter As the title suggests Sacred Underworld is pretty much the same as Sacred but a little better So if you like Sacred Sacred Underworld is very well worth playing 
Not my favorite game This game was enjoyable enough but doesn t really hold my interest enough to go back to it It lags a bit on my gamer PC and has some minor errors but all that aside it just wasn t that interesting to me The game is of a good quality and may be perfect for other gamers so it is still worth a good rating 
Slow in the Beginning but Picks Up Immensly All right I m quite sick of seeing people hate on this game I am addicted to Black White 2 As soon as you get past the whole tutorial business it s a free for all There are a couple problems First this game will not run on any old machine It better be fast and have a good video card that supports pixel shading The sound is good After installation issues you get to the game When you first play the game the tutorials are extremely helpful I first played the game on a laptop and as stupid as the camera rotating sounded I actually needed to know how to change the view with my fingerpad mouse laptop Learning completely how to interact with the world without having to refer to a manual I think is really good When you replay the game the tutorials seem redundant but does anyone remember that the tutorials give you tribute in order to buy advances to your civilization Now when you re trying to aquire 1 000 000 tribute to get the volcano miracle every little tribute counts So bare through the tutorials again and quit whining If you are the type of person that likes simulations Any of the Maxis sim games any from the Civilization series for example this game is highly addictive I personally don t enjoy gore and violence every five seconds and appreciate the building the civilization part You truly do get to control how the game goes Plus after you win a land you can stay there as long as you like and grow that metropolis until the entire island is covered in your houses and buildings It s obviously not a casual gamer type of thing Beating the game is a challenge as it should be but at the same time it is intriguing and fun I just was sick of seeing people give it such bad reviews Leave Black White 2 alone Just because you aren t competent enough to complete this game or need to shoot something every five seconds doesn t mean this game is bad 
play it a few times before reviewing plz stop doing reviews over how bad it is with to few options cuz it just simply isn t that way Yo can fire flaming people with catapults and or let you creature throw a flaming guy in the middle of an army so the middle of the army willl be on fire You just need to be creative Think like what will happen if I teach my creature to pick up a army guy set him on fire and than throw in the middle of a thightly builded city This game has many options but you ll have to create these options This wasn t really a review but a comment on other reviews who are saying that is boring and dull etc With this game you have to make it fun with your imagination 
Fun when it would run First off all the patches driver updates they recommended did not stop this game from crashing my PC something nothing else has ever done during every game session I have the ATI card they desired met the standards There was no online support other than reading what was already written Yet this game was enjoyable enough for me to play it at every opportunity rebooting as needed until I completed it Age of Empires 2 has been the only other PC game that has hooked me You will note as you begin this game that it has humor and in some ways is targeted for a teenage audience I think people of almost all ages can get a kick out of this unusual RPG game Have you heard of Populous It was a Playstation game where you were a goddess looking down controlling your tribe making sure towns were built and defended and throwing out some magic of your own B W2 reminds me of it except here you also have a creature your own pet that you help raise train through reward punishment I like that we are given a choice of 4 to choose from also There is enough freedom in this game to concentrate on fighting or city building or both whichever is your preference There are also little side missions that are optional to complete but give you more money to buy things They are puzzles to figure out Each land has a level and the game actually can go quickly especially after the 3rd land Your first enemies and last are the Aztecs which taunt you in the background while you play The 2nd are the Norse and 3rd the Japanese After you have completed all the levels the game lets you start over on level 3 with the Norse but now you have all the fancy buildings to impress them with and all the magic too Your creature is full grown and battle hardened This makes it almost too easy the 2nd time I have the Creature Expansion to this game on the way I hope it will be written to be more compatable with my PC 1 8 AMD XP w 2 HD s 1 gig ram This game is worth a try if you like city building or RPG 
network adaptor i love having the wireless network adapter but i was truely pissed when i saw it cost 99 99 Microsoft just trying to rip you off for something you basically have to own 
Preaching to the choir Well I must say after purchasing the Linksys WGA11B Wireless B Game Adapter that while yes this adapter is overpriced it does work and considering that I only got the Linksys adapter to work once and then it shut down in the middle of an update I must say the price looked worth it I can t vouch for your financial situations but after speading nearly 3 days trying to set up the Linksys when my wife finally said I should get this instead this hooked up and connected instantly No problems and I guess for the price it does look nice hooked in to the back of the Xbox So you may not have as many problems as I do with the Linksys but if you have any questions or limited computer networking ability this will be worth the price only because nothing simplier does exist So I would recommend this product if you want true plug and play which I don t believe the Linksys to be I m sure plently of people are happy with the Linksys it just didn t work for me So think first to avoid paying for both I would go back and never buy the Linksys if I could 
Great Game When I first heard of this game I basically ignored it Then when I was visiting Gamestop one day I decided to buy it I was instantly amazed by the unique battle system the bright and cheerful backdrops except for Twilight Town that is and the challenging and profound gameplay I have not played the first one but I will probably get it from the virtual console on Wii One problem with the game is that it s too short 
A worthwhile game for all that have a game cube Paper Mario The thousand year door is an awesome game One time I played it for 4 hours straight but your probubly wondering about the game not me Well first of all I would say this is a very creative game for everyone The music and replay value arent to good but it is definantly made up by the awesome gameplay graphics characters and story It made me laugh a few times and it was GREAT FUN when you first play it all the way through The way it does battling is similar to pokemon but a bit more complicated but it is really fun I realy like the punies and TEC the computer and yoshie The bad guys are the X nauts and I beat the crud out of them for what they did to TEC As always I highly recomend this game to anyone with a gamecube for someone who wants a pretty long and a bit of a challenging game 
Great Fun I ve been playing Mario games since the original debut on the NES and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game The RPG style is a great offshoot for the Mario franchise The dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30+ hours I spent playing the game were well worth it There s a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find I will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes Most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over 
Mario Playing Granny I am an old lady trying to play a kids game I aprreciate the fact that this game explains the moves to me very clearly I have enjoyed playing it and so have my grandchildren I am very glad I purchased it 
Paper Mario 2 great for casual entertainment I bought Paper Mario 2 for my neice to play when she comes over to visit now she comes over to play the game It has an interesting story line and many characters to interact with The puzzles are only moderatly hard so she hasn t gotten stuck and lost interest but the story is long enough that we haven t just breezed through it either It s better if you take so side trips to work the missions and fight in the arena where you can build up your levels faster You can also revisit previous lands and re fight the random encounters The only drawback to the game play is the long cut screens that you have to read The game flow would be better if there was an option to read these to you like Super Monkey Ball 2 I know I know educational aspect of reading yourself but that s her parents job not mine Game masters will find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck for long periods of time on puzzles then Parper Mario 2 will work for you Well worth the 20 pric 
Great game This game is really good I have a real up to date computer so everything runs fast and smooth The multiplayer is great You can play 1 000 s of people in a huge number of maps and game styles You can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear One of the down points is that in multilayer someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing Another thing would be the lag This is where the game moves real choppy or you lose the network connection Still its a really fun game 
Trust me I was a little worried about buying this game due to the mixed reviews on this website I found the official site for the game which to do that i googled the keyword Halo and when I went to their website you can download a free trial consisting of 1 single player mission and 1 online multiplayer level I m not one of those next gen gamers looking for the best graphics in the world and these ARE NOT the greatest graphics in the world but their enough to have a fun time All in all this is a fun game with awsome online capabilities This is definently a buy 
Multiplayer has good potential dies with bad community Aside from the instant impression that may be put on the reader of this review that I m reviewing this game only because of it s multiplayer singleplayer is actually what I look for in a game Multiplayer is just an extra to me however Halo was ported to the PC with online multiplayer in front of the mind Halo for the XBOX was originally intended to have XBOX Live multiplayer abilities but this feature never made it into the game Halo s amazing singleplayer campaign remains untouched which is a good thing If you are new to the Halo craze the story takes place between humanity and an alliance of alien races known as the Covenant After a narrow escape from an enemy fleet the USNC human alliance ship named The Piller of Autumn finds itself at a strange ring world that the Covenant call Halo When the ship is boarded by Covenant forces escape pods are launched and the ships surviving crew find themselves on Halo attempting to learn about it and uncover it s dark secrets while franticly fighting through armies of Covenant all the while You play as Spartan 117 known simpily as Master Chief You are a breed of super soldier created to turn the tide of a losing battle against the Covenant Stronger taller and better equiped than average marines you are a savior on the battlefield The game has 10 massive levels many with vehicles that are easy and fun to use while at the same time not forcing you to use them You can jump in and out of vehicles at will You can pick up any weapon lying around be it human or Covenant However you can only carry 2 weapons at a time not counting grenades You will encounter a few different species of enemy troops along the way such as Grunts Chunky little guys who don t do much damage even if they re in groups They do however use plasma grenades which will kill you 100 if it sticks to you If their forces are thinned or if the stronger unit that is leading them into battle is killed they will usually panic which sends them running around screaming Elites The backbone of Covenant forces elites carry plasma rifles higher ranking elites carry energy swords and deal out a powerful melee attack They also use an energy shield similar to yours making them equally difficult to kill They usually work in pairs or larger groups and can often be seen leading teams of grunts into battle Jackels These are back line troops They hide behind hand held energy shields and fire plasma pistols at you They can be dangerous in groups but they tend to shoot at you while you re fighting with other enemies and their shields are difficult to take down Hunters These are huge enemies with an extreamly powerful fule rod cannon the only weapon you can t pick up mounted to their arm and dish out a melee attack that sends marines flying Their armor is impossible to penetrate so you ll have to shoot them in their small exposed areas in between the armor plates They are always deployed in pairs as well You will also encouunter another race of alien spices later in the game that even the Covenant fear The graphics are now better than the XBOX version provided that your computer can run it at maximum quality If anything I just miss the XBOX controler Which is why I like the XBOX version of Halo better than the PC version With that Halo is still everything the XBOX version was only with online multiplayer battles Thanks to the people who play Halo s multiplayer however it s not very enjoyable I don t know what it is about Halo that causes it s online community to be mainly populated by 10 year olds who have never learned how NOT to swear in all caps every time someone kills them That s not the worst of it though Teamkillers Halo s multiplayer is COMPLETLY infested with them Every time you turn around in a team oriented battle a teammate is shooting you in the face If you re headed for a vehicle you should be on the lookout for a teammate who doesn t think that you are worthy of using it All the time If it wasn t for this it would be a great multiplayer game Another problem is that they didn t add campaign 2 player co op which was practicly the best part of Halo XBOX So your reasons to get this are A You don t have an XBOX but want to play Halo without having to spend an extra 150 B You prefer PC FPS games to console C You want good multiplayer but aren t bothered by the bad community D You can t stand to play a game unless it has the best possible graphical quality Overall Halo is hands down the best game I have every experianced I was a huge fan when it first came out on XBOX Though I still prefer the XBOX version PC is still great Compared to Call of Duty however the multiplayer fallsa little short mainly because of the people who infest it s online servers 
UNBELIEVABLE GAME This game rivals battlefront 2 for the all time greatest Star Wars game ver made This game is very similar to Halo in its 1st person concept w HUD Every level is different with lots of strategic tasks The graphics and gameplay are awsome I can t wait for this game to be 360 compatible 
Your not a Jedi In most starwars games your a jedi but in this one your a clone I that was cool You lead a squad around and give them orders like to attack a somthing blow something up or even hack a computer Unlike other games where your partners aren t much any help in this game your squad helps alot Also you don t have to do everything yourself you can tell your squad to do just about anything It is also fun to beat more than once and it s multi player is like Halo if you don t have xbox live I m thirteen 
Clone Wars at it s best This game is amazing Unlike so many other star wars games this is a first person shooter which is a great touch to the star wars universe I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons you have attachments to one gun The attachments are sniper and rocket launcher The single player campaign is outstanding though the multiplayer is so so This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title 
No instructions When I got my republic commando game the instruction booklet was missing I didn t want to wait for Amazon to send me another game with a book so I pop the CD in my Xbox and hoped I d be able to figure it out on my own And I was able too there are a lot of on screen hints to help you get through the 1st couple fights But without the book I never did figure out how to get my men to search a room for me or destroy enemies for me as described in other reviews I did most of the killing myself and it took me awhile by pushing ever button on the control pad to figure out how to change weapons and reload Still despite not having an instruction booklet to help me I was still able to finish the games in 4 nights Things I like about the game the graphic were great like watching a movie I didn t have to fit the bad guys over over and over again you know like other games like episode III were you die 7 or 9 times before you finally defeat the big villian and the story line keeps you hooked Things I didn t like about the game was missing the book And it was over too quickly I would say it is an easy game to play anyone can finish it even if your not a big time game player I would recommend playing this game 1st to get use to 1st person battle game play before buying hard M rating battle games 
The WORST voice acting ever in a videogame I will begin by saying that this game is COOL SLOW MO ACTION PACKED Just imagine a mix of the movie Payback Hard Boiled Die Hard and Matrix and put them on a videogame This gameplay is like Metal Gear Solid but fast and with so so graphics The voice acting is HORRIBLE AND SILLY but funny at the same time Max s voice is a cheap rip off from Mel Gibson s voice and the game say stufs like this OH NO NO PLEASE GOD NO OHHH BABY NOOO PLEASE MAX I JUST NEED YOU YOU WILL DYEEEAR COOL ACTION MOVIES AND I TALKING ABOUT THE COOLEST OF THE COOL I don t know about angels but is fear that gives men wings I made like Chow Yun Fat OHH HUHUHUHU I FELL THE WRATH OF THE FALLEN ANGEL Maxy Maxy Maxy come out wherever you are I didn t like the way the show started they gave me the best sit in the house I hope you laught soo ADIOS 
The PS2 might sell more but its limitations hurt this version of Max Payne While the PS2 version is not really bad it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the Xbox and PC The PS2 s sound and music to Max Payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on The gameplay is still good even though some areas are cut off do to the PS2 s limitations but that doesn t hurt the gameplay too much Graphics are also very scratchy and so are the characters even though all the versions of Max Payne don t have great character models the PS2 version looks even more out of order But the controls are better for PS2 the smaller controller the PS2 has really helps compared the Xbox controller and a keyboard Still highly enjoyable the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence If you can t get your hands on any other version then the PS2 is perfect for you 
Good for beginners too We just got a PS2 after having no game system at all since the old Atari I had when I was 13 So learning all the quot new fangled quot controls is a bit tricky Starsky and Hutch as well as being a fun game is straight forward enough that the learning curve was easy and enabled me to get right into the action without having to die a thousand times just to learn how to maneouvre As I get better with the controller the game is still proving to be fun and challenging without being frustrating 
Fun Game Cicken Little is a fantastic game This game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting sports unioform hunt and more The best part I like is the Carpool Craze 
Great idea but incomplete execution Gun aims to be the Western version of GTA but falls short Taking the non linear story and side mission type action genre is a good idea but the game just feels incomplete to me It is fun to play but on my medium high end Pentium 4 3 GHz 1 MB RAM GeForce 6800 GT system the framerate slows down quite a bit Not just when entering new environments but at random times when I m wondering why The game probably wasn t fully tested The voice acting is good but the graphics aren t spectacular even at the highest level Of course I had to crank down the graphics to increase the performance Gameplay isn t bad but GTA is much better as tasks are more difficult and require more time to accomplish The game took about 8 10 hours to beat the story missions and 15 20 hours for me to acquire 100 completion I also had an issue with not being able to assign some keys like the semicolon key to the game I hope there is a patch to correct annoying issues like this A funny part of the game is when talking to the people that give you tasks like the Indian hunter marshal and others They talk with their hands and sometimes their hands move even when they re not saying anything It s downright hilarious in an untested sort of way The game is good and received an editor s choice award in PC Gamer I think it s overrated but they did mention framerate hits and lower standard graphics as Gun s weaknesses I give this game a 78 due to the many performance graphical issues I ve experienced Activision online technical support hasn t proven its worth to me at least not yet Hopefully a patch will come out 
Gun Great Stoey Feels like you are in the old west But the Grafics are a bit slow All in all a Great Game 
A great escape I really enjoyed this game Yes it is not perfect but it is definitely worth the price of the game If you re looking for escape back to the old West then this is your game As many of the reviewers have mentioned there are some flaws in the game if you can get past them then I am positive you will enjoy the game The horse riding is fun but I also found myself enjoying the plot it plays like a movie The cut scenes are great fun to watch and are well voice acted The graphics are detailed as well I found that the artists took their time in modeling the weaponry of the era and it likely very historically accurate a big plus If you have ever wanted to be the star of a Western this is your chance If you like TV shows and movies such as Gunsmoke Deadwood and Once Upon a Time in the West you ll probably wonder where this game has been I did 
Great Buy I guess this is a good buy especially when Corporate Vice President and Chief XNA Architect of Microsoft says so I just thought it was interesting when J Allard gave a review of this product on Amazon co 
This is a Kit not just the card This is the KIT not just a card A previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 That is not correct They are selling the CARD for 49 99 This kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more You may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly It does what it intends to do 
Not Much To Say There is really not much to say about this kit however I think it is unfair that it received such a poor rating considering the only other reviewer s complaint that the kit is too expensive is inaccurate because the one he suggests is actually more expensive However this is truly a passport to an amazing gaming experience The Xbox Live experience is truly something innovative and relaly really fun and I would recommend buying an XBox 360 despite the next Playstation and Nintendo stations coming out However I also recommend waiting til after Christmas The rush to get these now is ridiculous and I have seen some consoles sell for over 800 dollars Why not wait til after Christmas when there will be an almost certain price drop to enjoy what this Xbox Live pack has to offer 
One Of The Greatest Vice City is awesome When im not doing missions Im usually runnin from the law I love the one liners Vercetti says D UR all D If I have to kill you I WILL One thing i dont like is there isnt an AK47 in the game instead they put the Ruger which is a variant But since this is th pc version thr are mods that can change it The wanted level is as follows 1 If a cop sees you hell go after you 2 More aggresive than last one 3 Police at their most agressive height w helicopters to track you down easier and Miami Vice is called to scene they pull up in a cheetah packin Uzi 9MMs 4 SWAT Team arrives in armored trucks in a unit of 4 also packin Uzis 5 If youve made it this far i suggest you get a car and mash upon the gas pedal cause now the FBI is after you These guys pull up in jet black suburbans packin MP5s 6 Now youve really done it The Army is on its way and their strapped to kill These guys arive in Rhino tanks Barracks army trucks The only thing you can do now is run for cover cause the Rhinos will blow up your car on contact unless you dodge them Another mistake ive found is that the Army uses MP5 like the FBI in the game when they should be using M16s you can also change that in the PC version 
Great fun for adults I may not be the typical game player as a 36 year old woman but I love driving games and this is one of the best driving games ever for the PC There was something a little crazy about enjoying speeding through the Miami streets running over pedestrians taking missions as a hit wo man and eluding the law The game has definitely stirred up a lot of controversy but it s just a game an ADULT game I loved the whole 80s Miami Vice theme and one of the most enjoyable parts of the game is speeding around town listening to the awesome radio stations in the car You can also create your own radio station with your MP3s The graphics of downtown and the cars are great but the characters can be a little stiff at times However this does not detract considerably from the fun factor Some of the missions are too difficult and trying to get through them over and over again became so tedious that I had to find some cheats online A more liberal save feature would have been nice As a result of some of the missions I still haven t finished the game but perhaps that s the beauty of GTA Vice City it s huge and you get your money s worth There s nothing I hate more than buying a game and finding it so simple that I finish it in a couple of days there s no risk in that with this game 
A new look for the MegaTen franchise While Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Raidou Kuzunoha vs the Soulless Army isn t actually an SMT game it is a member of the franchise It is actually part of a family of spin off games in the MegaTen series that is just using the SMT name to establish connections between the different series in the franchise finally appearing in America While not too many people are familiar with the games past this one takes the series in a new direction Devil Summoner is the first game in the MegaTen franchise that has moved past the traditional or tactical RPG style combat and gone straight into the action RPG genre In this game you play as a young man who has just attained the title of Kuzunoha Raidou the 14th the successor to a long line of Devil Summoners tasked with the protection of the capital city With his ability to see and control demons Raidou must solve a mystery that becomes increasingly more and more twisted as the game progresses The story begins with the player earning the Raidou name essentially this is the tutorial and being assigned to work at a detective agency in the capital One day you get a mysterious phonecall from a girl pleading for help and wants to meet with you late at night Reluctantly Raidou and his partner at the detective agency head out to meet her They find out the girl who contacted them has an odd request she asks them to kill her Before anyone can respond she is kidnapped by mysterious men in red and so sets forth a tale of demons evil and curses Essentially the game progresses much the way you would expect a MegaTen game to you travel to different locations via world maps and explore the different locations on larger area maps While wandering around the areas searching for clues and information there will be several random encounters the franchise is known for high encounter rates that will allow you the opportunities to capture new demons for aid More on that later though While exploring the areas you are able to have a demon deployed to follow you around keep in mind the normal people can t see it though Every demon type has special skills that can be used in the areas such as flying to reach far items scouting to find hidden items and enemy info and even mind reading to get some extra information from people These skills are essential to getting the information you need so it is wise to keep a demon of every type as often as possible Now for the battles This is where fans of the series will either love the game or hate it Gone are the pressed turn systems used in Nocturne and Digital Devil Saga Instead they are replaced with real time action battles You directly control Raidou and can use combinations of sword strikes and gun shots to defeat your enemies Raidou can t use magic so the only way he can deal elemental damage is using special bullets Luckily for him though he is able to have a demon deployed with him in battle but only one It will typically act on its own but you are capable of assigning it specific orders or general strategies By using your monsters in battle they will grow in loyalty to you When their loyalty is maxed out they will often give you bonuses and can then be used in fusions to create new demons Essentailly the system can get a little bit repetitive and while it will takes a while to get used to once you do it becomes a matter of knowing what enemies are weak to which attacks Once you figure that out though it s just a matter of keeping your levels high enough and capturing and fusing demons to keep gaining strength The style of capturing is brand new as well Gone is the negotiation system used in Nocturne and the original SMT games Instead it is replaced by a system that forces you to exploit enemy weaknesses When you hit an enemy with an element it is weak too it will become stunned and give you the chance to capture it by repeatedly pressing circle until a meter empties out You must empty the meter before the creature revives or you will not capture it The easiest way to do this is to wear down its health ahead of time before attempting a capture One note though you will automatically fail to capture if the enemy is a higher level than Raidou the moon is full or it is a boss battle The graphics and music in the game are a little different from what was seen in previous SMT releases here in North America It still uses the same form of cel shading but they are a little bit more defined and detailed Nothing too major but it is enough to really change the visuals overall appearance from the other games Also this game is not as dark and gritty as Nocturne or DDS In fact it has several amusing scenes and is much brighter and more vibrant overall This is greatly illustrated by the music which is often much more lighthearted and is comprised of a lot of horns and brass instruments Not nearly as dark and brooding as the other two games But since this game takes place in 1920 s Japan and not a post apocalyptic world this time it fits in quite well Overall Devil Summoner is a new spin on an old franchise While it does display that full action battles aren t as well suited for the style of the game Atlus was able to do it well enough that it still remains fun and keeps the game enjoyable For a lot of people who found the turn based systems of Nocturne and DDS overbearing and cumbersome this could be a nice way to ease into the world of the MegaTen franchise While it is not nearly as epic as the previous games it holds its own and the story alone is enough to keep a fan of the franchise sated long enough to finish the game off regardless of whether or not they like the change of style Definately not the best game in the franchise but a nice refreshing change that is fun none the less

Excellent High Quality no lagging The bottom of the controller sticks out quite a bit but this does not affect gameplay and other than that it is the same size as the regular gamecube controller Simply fantastic unless you re one of those people that just NEED to have rumble for some reason But one slight problem Is it just me or do the trigger buttons occasionally fail For example in Resident Evil 4 I ll be holding the R button to aim but it will quickly go back and forth from normal view as if the button cancels out However this is rare and maybe it s just me Once again an excellent high quality controller 
great controller looks and feels great This is a very awesome controller It looks great and its wireless i have not had any problems I can lay on my couch 10 feet away and play without having to worry about accidently unplugging the controller because the cord is too short This controller is way better than the wired controller it comes with I recommend this controller to anyone who owns a gamecube I bought it at gamestop for 17 dollars used great deal Buy it now 
These are GREAT No wires For us the range has not been a problem and they work just like a normal controller The ONLY drawback is that the kids leave them turned on and the batteries need replaced As long as you don t use the rumble option the batteries seem to last a long time 
Great Controller NIntendo products are as reliable as ever I was very pleased at both the range and the battery life of the wavebird and realized how little vibration matters I would highly recommend this over any other wireless controller 
best nintendo DS game seriously This is the ultimate mario game super addicting you will want to play this for days on end beware I managed to beat the game in about a month but I can still unlock paths and you can always reset it and start over my daughter can play it she is 4 tells you how easy it is but don t let that fool you it can be a tough game the further you get The only negative point I can say is when you get to the final battle it is a little disappointing it only took me about 10 tries before I won either I am a natural at winning quickly doubt it or they made it too easy to win regardless stop reading this review and buy it you will thank me for it 
Lotta Fun Old School Style It s a fun game If you like Super Mario don t miss It wasn t as good as previous classic games like SMB SMB 3 or SMBW but it sure is fun I played every level except the last one is too hard I looked up the video on YouTube and decided that was good enough I hate hate hate when levels are too hard and you have to be a computer to pass them The last level is the only hard one I tried about 25 times and gave up and watched the video online If a game is too hard I m not going to sit there all day doing the same thing over and over again This is a great game except for that last frustratingly repetitious level 
GTA3 Vice City SA Best games ever created The GTA series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created 
The most freedom you can have in a videogame today Okay first of all this game is a VERY violent game and i would NOT recommend parents to buy it for children under 13 You must also make sure that they know the violence and crime is FAKE There will be serious consequences for doing these things in real life and they know not to do what they do in this game Back to the game this is simply hands down the best game ever created It is an innovation within an innovaton The storyline is excellent as you get betrayed and shot by your friend during a bank robbery Later you must work your way through the dark streets of Liberty City working your way toward the ones who betrayed you The missions never repeat themselves and they are always fun and challenging BUT you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without codes and i do not know anyone who did So i strongly advise you get the codes before playing Other than that the sense of freedom this game gives you in between and after all of the missions is astounding You can go almost anywhere and do almost anything something never before acheived in a video game Gameplay 5+ Extremely fun and addictive especially when you have a group of your friends around you to see your crazy runs from the law and laugh as you drive your car off a cliff into the ocean nothing beats the feeling when you watch your friend do the same thing Sound 5 The radio stations are great especially game fm The commercials are extremely hilarious and you can even make your own custom radio station with your own tunes Graphics 4 Allright but could be better Storyline 5 Great story very fun missions I really have to congratulate rockstar with their acheivment in the video game industry Great job guys As for the people reading this if this game is on its way to your house right now click the buy button above Bottom line WOW 
Great Game Grand Theft Auto is now in 3rd person perspective No more overhead camera Well at least it s not the only mode of view That in itself makes this game great You re an escaped convict that s trying to establish a name for himself and make some money by completing missions The cities are virtually yours Vast easy to explore no limitations You can jump and hijack any car beat a poor old lady with a baseball bat even steal police cars But don t go too trigger happy or else the feds will be all over you You take on various missions and upon completing them you receive credits and advance onto more interesting and complicated ones GTA3 is great fun to play Good graphics a lot of missions to complete very many cars and weapons 
Lots of fun If you re looking for a game that teaches you some life skills or some morals ethics this is not the game for you If you re looking for a game where you get to blow all sorts of stuff up and wreck havoc and mayhem you ve come to the right place Some of the challenges in the game are nearly impossible Which is fine because then you can just drive around the city and cause chaos Cheats make the game much more fun since it gives you weaponry you would otherwise not be able to get for instance a tank This game is great for when a person needs to relieve some stress and wants a forum to take out their frustrations without fear of legal consequences But this game is definitely not for kids Killing innocent people carjacking vehicles beating up prostitues for money and murdering cops is material that is totally inappropriate for children But for adults looking for non wholesome fun this is it My only complaint about the game are some of the glitches walking through walls getting stuck in walls etc 
Castlevania Curse of Darkness Who needs Belmont Castlevania as a whole started with one thing in mind kill the vampire plaquing the land The same can be said about Castlevania Curse of Darkness You play as Hector a devilforge master What s a Devil Forge master you ask A person with the ablity to create monsters and or weapons Devil forge masters in this game have the same amount of power as Dracula s right hand man Death Huge 3D like invorments like from LOI wild monsters gorgeous graphics and a suporior sound track help Hector along the way to get revenge for the love of his life Rosaly As far as story line time this happens a little after Castlevania 3 Dracula s curse So in other words you old school guys like me will enjoy seeing what happeded after Castlevania 3 Pick it up today you will NOT BE SORRY Oh yea did I mention that you get to play as Trevor Belmont Oh I didn t good luck and make Dracula pay 
Great game This game is great fun but why has one of the moronic reviewers decided to tell everyone the plot of the game IDIOT 
True To Your Dreams Castlevania Curse of Darkness is a true gem among xbox games I think it was more designed to be a bridge for a game that s coming out in the future that be two player Probably xbox360 or Play station 3 So they have get you the gamers used to someone other Trevor Belmont One Dracula Is NOT DEAD He get s reborn he needs one of the devil forger masters to get reborn So its either Hector or Isaac who has to die to bring forth Dracula So since your Hector and that leaves only Isaac who becomes Dracula Dracula is mad at Hector for running off during the big battle thus blaming him for his down fall to Trevor Belmont But here only point in the whole game that gets me Hector is way up in the army of evil and he has a change of heart just because Dracula wants to kill every human who wants them destroyed That part brothers me but who cares its fun game anyway hacking and slashing all the creatures of the dark So its like a complexed stories line But along the way you don t know what s what s It come to you in the movies and not all what you see is what is Like in the beginning you meet Zead and Saint Germain Now Zead wants to help you on your quest and Saint Germain wants to try and stop you They both hate each other Zead seems so nice and Germain like a total pain Why not any help that helps you average the death of your wife to the town people who bur her as a witch sounds good You have to fight Saint Germain latter and to tell you the truth he is hard he pulls out a gun try s to shoot you when he near death Latter you find out Zead is Death the Grimm Reaper after you fight Isaac and Zead takes Isaac and turns him into Lord Dracula for the final fight When you beat Dracula you seen the ending Now everyone says this game is to short When actual its two games you can play as Trevor Belmont and its totally different then playing as Hector as game play is concern more classical Castlevania from the NES and SNES days So if you don t like the devils and want a more classical game try beating it once and play as Trevor But you also find out in the ending from Saint Germain there will be another finial battle hint another game of Castlevania in the works So honestly the game play is cool the battles are fun and if you play long enough you can truly enjoy this game and its plot twists It took me 30 hours to beat it with hector and I m finish play it with Trevor Belmont but can say its good I cant campare this to the play station games my last Castlevania was Castlevania X for SNES It reminds me a lot of that game the stages do but these are more in detail and more fun 3d One more then there is a love stories at the end yes I know not what you where expecting between Hector and Julia Laforeze Doesn t it melt your heart Yes Isaac sister and the hero How ironic There hidden stages more bosses after you beat it and its truly a gem among xbox games Some will be mad cause I wrote this but the cheesy plot line about Dracula being death and fighting for so long to beat this game figure ill just go ahead and tell it Its great game 
One of the best Xbox games As someone who enjoyed previous Castleavania games going back to the early Nintendo systems I did find this new incarnation to be somewhat different than the 2D games of old But I still liked it a lot Basically this game has been my main preoccupation for the last 2 weeks or so I d rank it as one of the top 5 Xbox games I ve ever played out of 50 or so in terms of sheer fun level Primarily I liked the fact that as you gain new items skills you can go back to previously explored areas and new areas will open up This expanding universe aspect makes it similar to the Super Metroid games and a little like some of the Zelda titles for Gamecube I also found the Combine system of seeking out materials to create new weapons and armor to be very engrossing and I liked the various ways to obtain those materials steal from monsters seek out hidden rooms etc The graphics and sound FX are well below the all time great level of games like Halo 1 or 2 but they re perfectly servicable ranging from very good to excellent I thought the spooky ambiance of the various castle hallways dungeons etc was actually captured rather well Although I did completely get into the process of exploring the various worlds of this game especially with the help of some online FAQ references I will concede a few drawbacks The currency s uses are fairly limited There s only one shop and the things you most want or need cannot be bought there And in the later stages of the game you accumulate a lot of excess cash that can t be used for anything Also the process of levelling up your character and his I D innocent devil companions definitely got rather repetitive and a little boring after awhile Those are minor drawbacks however Overall this is a great game 
Definately Not Just A Kids Game Ok so it really ticks me off to know that I m near thirty and an 8 year old kid could probably destroy me on games like this but a friend of mine bought me this game for Christmas due to my obsession with Rabbits and I fell in love from the first tutorial level where you have to catch over a hundred rabbits with your BUN GUN I was hooked like a lab rabbit needing crack I was hooked I have actually beaten this game over a month or so later but still have tons of missions left to complete as many of the new video games are it s set up on percentages instead of LEVELS and though there are I guess we can talk old school there are different WORLDS you visit but so many missions that slowly raise the percentage so I guess you could find the certain missions to defeat just to hurry up and beat the game but the missions makes it more satisfying this games can make me so mad I see red trying to beat certain missions but other missions are a breeze but that s what I love a game that actually challenges me gives me something to work towards and when you finally beat a mission you really feel like you ve done something and the graphics are amazing I highly suggest if you liked the movie get this game or if you liked the SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS games such as Battle For Bikini Bottom The Movie and the Flying Dutchman you should get this game it s even better dare I say 
Fun and Enternaining This game is just like the film and the quality of playing is uncoutned for where the fun just keps going Highly recommended ages 3+ Don t forget the memory card 
GREAT GAME We rented this game out before we purchased it and we really like it We went to see the movie and our almost 4 year old son loved Shark Tale so we thought we d give the xbox game a try and happy we did Its really a great game The controls are pretty simple for our son to play the game he needs help with the game but overall he enjoys it My husband and I both like playing this game as well Its fun has pretty great graphics great music in the background good game play Its not to hard for kids but not to easy for adults either so you don t get bored of this game We have nt played very far into the game yet but so far its a big hit at our house 
Great Game Empty Ending I loved the game The characers are great The worlds are interesting it still deosnt look outdated And the combat is fairly strategic Unfortuneatley the games ending is rather lack luster 
I enjoyed it more than the original Well I picked this up being a Star Wars fan I was a little worried as the first game didn t really rock my boat but I really want to like the Star Wars rpgs so I gave this one a shot I finished it in a marathon time and enjoyed it It does have one major bug but there are fixes out there if you run into a show stopper The graphics are on par with the original but Ithought the story was superior and it kept me interested till the end I look forward to the next game in the series now 
Not as good as the PC game but still AWESOME Half Life 2 for the Xbox is here and somehow Valve managed to squeeze in every little ounce of gameplay that appeared in last year s hit PC game barely And let s get this out of the way now Half Life 2 for the Xbox is in terms of content exactly the same as the PC version s single player game so if you played it on the PC there s nothing new for you here And note that we did say single player game because the Xbox version lacks Counter Strike Source the latest version of the hugely popular online action game that came with Half Life 2 on the PC So when you get down to it Half Life 2 for the Xbox is basically just the acclaimed single player campaign for Half Life 2 And that s why Half Life 2 for the Xbox comes off as a bit underwhelming Yes it s a fairly solid translation of one of the better first person shooters of recent years but it also lacks the extensive multiplayer and mod making features of its PC cousin In Half Life 2 you once again assume the role of Gordon Freeman the theoretical physicist and dimension hopping commando who saved the world from an alien invasion at the end of Half Life Or did he Half Life 2 starts you off facing the infamous G Man the mysterious blue suited character from the original At the end of Half Life the G Man offered you a choice work for him or die Since there would be no sequel if you chose the latter Half Life 2 assumes you chose the former and so you start the game on a train entering City 17 for your introduction into this new world City 17 is a run down urban center that s the equivalent of the Warsaw ghettos during World War II instead of Jews being rounded up to live in City 17 it s all the remnants of a defeated humanity Half Life 2 takes place an untold number of years after the Black Mesa incident but it s clear that much has changed A mysterious enemy known as the Combine has conquered the planet and installed a human puppet government to carry out its rule Black clad security forces patrol the streets while propaganda blares endlessly from omnipresent video screens If there s one thing that Valve does extremely well it s capturing a sense of atmosphere as this vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective But you won t spend a lot of time soaking in the scene before you re thrust into the struggle to defeat the Combine and free humanity You ll be on your own during most of the game but there are levels in which you ll have the opportunity to fight alongside allies both alien and human Some of the best team moments come later when you re battling the Combine in the streets and buildings of City 17 with large scale battles going on between groups of humans and the Combine s huge spiderlike striders You never really develop any attachment to your teammates though as they tend to be very disposable and replacements are available at regular intervals Teammates have a tendency to get in your way in cramped interiors Even though they ll slowly move out of your way it s still a little annoying In addition to taking on teammates you ll occasionally have the opportunity to set up sentry guns to assist you in defense The toughest sequence that we encountered involved setting up a handful of sentry guns in a defensive alignment and then holding out against waves of incoming Combine soldiers Another surprise is the somewhat disappointing performance by the artificial intelligence Most of the humanoid enemies don t seem to show the same kind of intelligent behavior that they did in the original even on the tougher difficulty levels They ll seek cover and then peek out to fire but invariably they ll charge at you which makes it easy to take them down And maybe it s due to some of the weapons being a bit overpowered but most opponents don t present much of a challenge at all a few rounds is usually enough to stop them There are a few fearsome foes like the larger ant lions which will tirelessly pursue you while you frantically unload every bullet you have at them Then there s the strider the 50 foot tall walking organic tank that fires devastating bursts and can spear you with one of its legs if you get too close But for the most part Half Life 2 is surprisingly easy even on the tougher difficulty levels Case in point is the end of the game which feels anticlimactic You re given a horrendously overpowered weapon to use against relatively weak opposition When you get down to it Half Life 2 for the Xbox is an excellent single player game If you didn t get a chance to play the PC version then you owe it to yourself to check out the game on the Xbox even though it s not as smooth and as sharp as what you ll find on the PC You ll find few games that can match Half Life 2 s quality in terms of immersion and gameplay And all these months after its original release it s still an excellent first person shooter that should be experienced by most every action fan Just don t expect anything more after the game ends 
Very good with a few scratches Half life 2 on XBOX is is better than other shooters like Halo and the like because instead of simply going in for the kill you have to be resourceful and quick witted to navigate the levels and overcome obstacles Not to mention and I loosely quote one of Halo s developers Halo is all about the same thirty seconds of fun repeated over and over He couldn t be more correct In Half Life 2 progression usually guarantees new sights and stimulates interest in playing further The guns are not anything incredibly original but they are well balanced and have some cool features At least none of them need ten seconds to charge to make one shot effective like Covenant weapons As for story the beginning is absolutely riveting as you work to escape the Orwellian cruelty of the Combine s city The city itself is beautifully rendered and very believable as are the NPC s The alien creatures you encounter are a heck of a lot less annoying than Halo s Flood I think the head crabs could use work though They look like animate rotisserie chickens Awesome game by far better than most of the competition My only major complaint is that the vehicle levels are too long and repetitive and the vehicle controls suck and you can t see a freakin thing This won t kill the game for you but by God in the ski boat level it will definitely try Anyway if you like shooters at all buy this one 
Half Life 2 Pros and Cons Pros 1 Storyline is very detailed There is a lot of twists and turns I m not going to spoil it find out for yourself 2 The weapons are very nice Everything from the classic crowbar YAY and the gravity gun preform very well You can damage just about anything in the environment and use it to your advantage 3 The physics are amazing Water rippling to things flying through the air is all very well done Makes you get a real sense of the game 4 The A I is challenging and varified Also different weapons work better on some than others so it s fun to experiment 5 THere is no really specific road to follow in this game You can explore and find secret compartments and stuff 6 There is actually a bunch of little thinkers in this game In order to get somewhere like in a sewage tunnel or over a fence you may have to do something first such as flip a switch or put something somewhere Gives you a challenge 7 Saving is nice You can save anywhere in the game So if you lose you ll just go back to you last checkpoint Cons 1 It loads a lot If you have an xbox w a lot of games on it it might load slower I m not positive though It runs pretty good on mine but yeah there is quite a lot of point loading But the game itself makes up for it I rated Half life 2 4 5 stars b c it is a very good game It is very accurate with it s gameplay making it as challenging as fun Plus who can t resist playing baseball with headcrabs 
The Best FPS on Xbox I have played every FPS that comes out on Xbox Of course I like Halo Doom 3 but love playing anything Conflict makes i e Desert Storm I and II Vietnam and Global Terror and the Rainbow 6 series since I m in the Army Half Life 2 is by far the best game I have played I thought I wouldn t like it because it had no map option or hints for objectives but all you have to do is have time and an imagination and you will be spending hours on end playing this game I bought it for 15 00 at Game Stop but if I had of spent 49 99 I would not have been disappointed one bit I have not beat this game but have put over 512 over 8 hours minutes into it This is definitely worth buying used or new if you have time you will get your worth out of this game C Murde 
Sheer perfection GOTY of the year 2004 My best friend is a Halo lover When I learned of this game I was not that interested until I read some reviews and saw videos of what you could do in the game not to mention the graphics For quite a while my best friend and I got into a crazy dispute inbetween which game is better I enjoy Halo but Half Life 2 just overpowers it so much On the P C I think the only thing that could beat it is Half Life 3 once it comes out and that is what my friend says about Halo 2 the only thing that will beat it is Halo 3 Now Half Life 2 on the P C doesn t take an entirely high tech computer in fact you can have a graphic card with Direct X7 for this game on the P C If you own the P C version I m sure you have been told before there is no reason to buy it on Xbox which is true The game is a port of the P C version and you will probably find nothing new in the Xbox version caompared to the P C version If you have an incredibly high P C don t waste your money on the Xbox version because a P C with at least an ATI Radeon X800 video card 2 4ghz processor 512mb ram I m pretty sure can run the game at max I m not sure I don t own the P C versoin Okay now for the game itself This game does NOT have a multiplayer componant so if you are only in the game for the multiplayer side of things YOU WON T find any If you are complaining you will understand why this game has no multiplayer componant by the end of this review Half Life the original game was released by Valve a game company in the year of 1999 and went on to be the computer game of that year Six years later SIX years Valve worked on a sequel and released it in 2004 The game is my favorite game of all time for now The game won nine GOTY Game of the Year awards in 2004 which included Game of the Year it beat Halo 2 P C game of the year Outstanding innovation in Computer Gaming Outstanding Achievemant in Animation Outstanding Achievmant in Art Direction Outstanding Character Performance Male Outstanding Achievmant in Game Play Engineering Outstanding Achievmant in Visual Engineering and First Person Action Game of the Year So it won nine GOTY awards but it nominated in eleven Since Half Life 2 is such a story driven game I will begin at the storyline If you have not played Half Life 1 the storyline may not make much sense which makes the game even better because you get to puzzle your past storyline with the world you are currently in Not even I have yet understood everything about what happened in the first Half Life game and I probably never will But to give you some sense of what is happening is that you play as a character named Gordan Freeman who several years ago was transfered over to a science research facility called Black Mesa From what I know Gordan accidentally unleashed alien races upon the earth I will not say anymore to ruin the storyline because the less you know the better it is I ruined quite a bit of the storyline for myself becuase I found out too much about the game Now for characters Characters in the game are incredibly realistic I have been told before that Valve created into the characters faces what they called muscles In the game the characters obviously do not have real muscles but if you look at the movement of the characters jaws they actually move escpecially during the opening scene Besides the complexity of the characters realistic looking muscles the characters have excellant voices that could not have anyone else doing their voices better The characters will actually be more immeresed into the game rather than your average F P S In areas where there is only dialoge which are enjoyable you might notice that if someone is talking to you they will be looking directly at you If you go behind them while they are talking to you they will turn around instead of just stand there talking to thin air If there is something passing by a character like a friend their eyes will actually follow the person walking by which always amazes me Gameplay Probably every review of this game you find will most likely have it s largest section on the gameplay of Half Life 2 and for good reason There is a single element that truly makes writing about the gameplay worthwhile Physics Most games that you play will have something known as Ragdoll Physics this is where if you are to find a dead enemy nearby they will move around according to their enviroment For example if you were to walk over a dead body in a game with Ragdoll Physics the body will most likely start rolling These are physics found in games like Republic Commando and Far Cry Half Life 2 is built in with a unique physics engine made by Valve called Havok Physics Havok Pysics is one of the best versions of the physic engines abailable on the gaming market Every object in the game has different weights and when you strike shoot move or whack those objects they actually feel real and look real The explosions made with this physics engine are so amazing and when you shoot explosive barrels you can see red shattered pieces fly in different directions looking like the explosion came from the inside which it did You will find most of the physics interactible through one of the best weapons in first person shooters today The Gravity Gun This weapon has the Law of Physics built right into it pretty much everyting is your weapon and I think you could figure it out from there More of the gameplay would be including your fameous hazard suit which can provide you with shielding if you charge it The suit will also allow you to breath underwater for a time being it comes equipped with a rechargeable flashlight and a cool sprint feature which recharges too Gamespy said in the P C review of Half Life 2 that throughout the game you are introduced with new weapons one by one and whenever you get a new weapon you are put in situations that you will need that weapon so you can learn which enemies you should shoot with which weapons where to use the weapons and how to use them tactically which is a very good way to show you how to use the weapons of this game There are eleven weapons in this game which may seem small but with the Gravity Gun you do not need any more And I do not think that you could come up with any more weapons that you would want A I Half Life has pretty tough A I and they really know how to flank and throw grenades The grenades will draw you into areas that you will be shot up and killed or the grenades will kill you so the combat is pretty intense You can hear the Combine enemies talking to each other through radios in their helmets as they plan to attack you Overall the combine are the largest example of A I in Half Life 2 other enemies aren t as smart because they are more animalistic rather than human Sound For every weapon every voice every explosion every splash of water every alarm every organic noise you hear in this game WILL be good Water sounds are what you will find in most games just because they are all pretty much the same When you hear strange creatures getting shot and their legs break or blood splatters from them it sounds like it should Gun shots could not be wanted in any other way I already mentioned voices Ign s video review of the P C version of this game says that you cannot really say anything bad about this game that goes for the sound too Where next oh music The game has great music it has this strange feeling to it but it fits that is all I can really say Some reviews say that this game has bad framerate Gamespot but I will say that it only occurs when there is large amounts of physics taking place and if you say that so and so has better framerate than Half Life 2 I simply ask you Does that game have the Havok Physics Engine And if it does okay Half Life 2 is still better I said earlier that you will find out why there is no multiplayer componant of Half Life 2 available which is true it is because it is hard enough to get such a great game as Half Life 2 on the Xbox alone with it s complex physics engine If you want Half Life 2 in a multiplayer apect I would not blame you with the gravity gun that has to be fun But there is a game made from Valve on the Xbox made specifically for multiplayer called Counter Strike it is modern warfare from what I know with M 16s and alike but from what I have heard it is incredibly fun go ahead and buy that one if you want it is from the same company but just to know it will not look as good becuase Counter Strike is a pretty old game I think The game is supposed to be filled with crazy multiplayer combat but I have not played it so I will leave it at that I saved one of the largest parts of the game for last Graphics Valve has created a masterpiece when it comes to the graphics of this game Six years really allowed them to go as far as they could when it comes to their graphics this IS the best looking Xbox game out there Compared to the P C graphics with a ATI Radeon X800 video card it will not look that good and on the xbox there is some minor details that could not be brought up to what they should look like but they are details that you will not be paying that much attention to If you played a game where the graphics are impressive but still not that great walked up to a wall you can see the flaws and the fakeness of the graphics When you walk out a good twenty feet the wall will then look realistic In Half Life 2 the flaws are still there but you only need to be about ten feet away instead of twenty I wish I could keep on going and I probably can but I have spent at LEAST an hour typing this review to just say that this game is one of the best games out there and is most likely the best first person shooter on the xbox and probably always will be If you see a game with the words Valve on the front in a box outlined in white lines expect perfection unless it is counter strike those games are more based on the multiplayer side of things rater than all the aspects of a normal game My closing statement is that Half Life 2 is a game of sheer perfection it is the best xbox single player game available BUY THIS GAME It is worth it 
The best game on Xbox In my opinion yes Anyone who has heard about this game but doesn t have a fast enough computer to run it as was the case with me should buy this game The gameplay is inspired There is only one section midway through the game where I felt that the transition from mouse and keyboard to a console control pad hurt the game Outside of that one complaint the graphics are amazing for Xbox the sound design is girpping with atmospheric music that wafts in and out The characters are interesting and well acted Everything about this game is TOP NOTCH Anyone who says that Halo 2 is a better game is quite simply an idiot Halo obviously has better multiplayer as this game has none but outside of that there is simply nothing on Xbox that comes close to the single player experience Awesome awesome game 
Nancy Drew s First Adventure Although this doesn t follow the original book it s a combination of several stories it holds the 1930 s flavor The design of the scenes are appealing and there are enough puzzles throughout the story I don t know if this is with all the DVDs but with this one I had to keep the mouse pointer a half inch or so in front of the car in order to move it which sometimes proved a bit annoying In playing it twice now I ve discovered that you can solve the clues in a different order and still come to the same conclusion Nice 
The Secret of the Old Clock is Fun Time Spent Its no secret that I m not a fan of point clicks They seem to be harder in general on my computer than 3 D action games which is something I ll never understand unless it has to do with the copy protection software I ve played through three or four of the Drew games Secret of the Old Clock was the most fun for me I liked the golf game and the sewing project I actually was proud when I finished the sewing side quest I liked driving around in the car In retrospect its analogous to guiding a magnet through a maze I had fun none the less I stumbled a little with the CB radio that got a little convoluted and bizarre but I did it The other games were either too hard or too easy This one will keep you occupied for a little while this one will employ an element of fun mar 
Sadly disappointing I was so disappointed in the new addition to the Nancy Drew games I solved the whole case in two evenings and never once had to check with the online community to see if I was doing it right The puzzles were not near as challenging as the other games and I was disappointed that the body of the games involves having to drive around and deliver telegrams I have come to love these games because of the challenging aspects and the mind bending puzzles This one did NOT make my list of favorites 
Great fun for D D and any RPG fans A thoroughly enjoyable game If you like games like Neverwinter Nights or Diablo then this game is for you Lots of fun A wide selection of races and classes to choose from I recommend this game to anyone who has a fondness for RPG style video games 
One of the Best Game from BlackIsle There are 2 games in this Ultimate Collection IWD + Expansion Pack and the other is IWD2 And there s a BGM CD in it and of course manuals included This Ultimate Collection is better than I thought because I purchased Baldur s Gate Ultimate Collection too But only Game CDs in it no manuals 
Really hits the spot Besides Baldur s Gate II Icewide Dale is the second most fun CRPG game out there More action than role playing which is fine with me This is a single player multi character game and you get to create the entire party of 6 adventures The plot is fairly weak but the action is plentiful and I love the fact that you get to develop 6 different characters If you have to get just one of the Icewind Dale games get Icewind Dale II The character generation and development is much better not to mention the gameplay and graphics 
This game is awesome in gameplay Pros 1 Character creation is fun detailed and basically unmatched by any game on the market much better than the NWN creation system 2 Graphic is beautiful but if you are expecting fully 3D environment you will be disappointed 3 Music is just awesome 4 Did I mention Character Creation is FUN Playing your custom made party is a very satisfying experience Any kind of team is playable You can solo the game too if you like Cons 1 Does not feature 3D environment like NWN 2 Gameplay is linear but I didn t care as the point of my game is to develope my character 
By comparison I have played all the rpgs Baldur s Gate NWN Dungeon Siege Final Fantasy TOEE etc And I have to say that stumbling upon Icewind Dale 2 was a real treat Sure the graphics are dated but WOW the storyline the dialogue the descriptions of the rooms and actions are all incredibly well written A breath of fresh air after playing DS The quests don t get in the way of the game like so many others that get bogged down in annoying side quests as a lame attempt to flesh out the world I would have prefered the game to be turn based like TOEE but this game s battles are numerous and really fun partially to good monster design compare bugbears in this game to NWN so much better and partially to the unforgettable situations and dungeons When pitted against other D D ruleset games the spell choices offered and levels they are given at is superior to all others I actually enjoyed having a Druid in my party who could transform his arms into pythons and for the first time in CRPG history actually used summon animals spells Even if many spells were simular to other games these felt more tailored to the characters and made useful instead of waiting till higher levels to get one useful spell My favorite part is that I could handpick my team where as in Baldur s Gate I was forced to play with characters I didn t like or NWN where it was removed and tedious to interact with henchmen I enjoyed RPing the characters backgrounds and interactions in my head and really enjoyed finding the treasure unique to IWD2 like a wide variety of cut gems which became an addiction If you updated this game graphically to the level of TOEE and made it Turn Based with battle tactics It would be my all time favorite RPG 
A great collection for any RPG I ve decided to buy this collection after a reading a lot of reviews from different websites But none of them are very clear about the contents of the package so here is the contents of the package 1 Icewind Dale 2 CD s 2 Icewind Dale Expansion Heart of Winter 1CD 3 Icewind Dale II 2 CD s 4 Icewind Dale soundtrack 5 Icewind Dale II bonus disk 6 Icewind dale strategy guides trailer of IWD II This package is well worth the purchase u get a series of one of the best selling game developed by pioneers who have also developed games like Fallout series BG1 abd BG2 The graphics are great they look bright and crisp The soundtrack is great and suits well with the ambience u really feel the snow falling and the cold weather The gameplay is fun it is more like a hack n slash game i m a greatest fan of diablo series so i love this game as well To put it in a nut shell this game is Hack n slash with D D rules If u like diablo u will certainly like this Baldurs gate fans will slightly get disappointed with the game play Charecter creation is great this game allows dual class charecters so it adds more fun to gameplay My only complaint is there is no interation within r party members but this doesn t affect the gameplay experience Overall if u ever have a thought of getting this game and don t know whether its worth the money the answer is plainly a best value for r money 
If you like the show you will enjoy the game I really enjoy this game I think they could have done better some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly I enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do However I ran into a glitch and I went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all I played 2 nights in a row thinking I did something wrong before I looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game One I followed the instuctions I was finally able to move on so watch out for that It s right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle then enter a wharehouse to protect Madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in The instructions I followed are as follows Turn on your PS2 is turned off with game and memory card in then load the game it should be at 4 28 If its not see NOTE below When the cut scene with Jack and Tony begins remove the memory card and the Warning memory card removed Use save game option to manually save progress re enable autosave Press X for OK and re insert the memory card then watch the cut scene The Previously on 24 dialog box will appear press X then play the game as usual If done correctly many men will enter After you complete the mission make sure you save it NOTE If your memory card is at 4 41 Go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene You will overwrite 4 41 and be back at 4 28 It helped me and if it happens to you believe me you will be glad you read this because I sure was 
Awesome This game is awesome I bought and it reminds me of the show exactly The graphics are the best I ve ever seen I feel like I m right there next to Jack and Tony fighting in a race against time The game is challenging but not to challenging you can t beat it It has a lot of action packed levels with a lot of options You ll really want to get this game It s definatley worth it 
FAN OF 24 MUST BUY IT If you enjoy the series you will love the game as simple as that Very entertaining Don t miss it 
The Best Game Ever I ve been a 24 fan ever since I saw the very first episode It delivered drama action and shocks and twists After the end of Season 2 and the beginning of season 3 I was left with questions How did David Palmer recover and how did Jack Bauer and Chase Edmunds first started working together Then I heard that 24 The Game was coming out and that it would answer those question plus more because it takes place between Seasons 2 and 3 In this game you get to play Jack Bauer yes Tony Almeida and Chase Edmunds When I first played this game I felt like I WAS Jack Bauer The graphics are stunning and look just like him It also has Kiefer Sutherland s voice which made it even more realistic This game nearly had me believing that I was living the life of Jack Bauer The game also has an amazing storyline it s pretty much watching another season It also nearly takes 24 hours to finish depending on how well you get used to it What is also great about this game is that while you are playing it it will go to split screen shots like on the show The game stays true to the show you have 24 hours to stop terrorist from unleashing devestating attacks against America and live the life of Jack Bauer I highly recommend buying this game for all of the 24 fans beginners and for the those who have watched it from the beginning It is in my opinion the best game ever made So far

You will never pick up NBA Live again I have always loved EA games i have purchased every single Madden game since 97 and every nba live game since 01 With that said I see very little improvement over the years Last year NFL 2K5 blew away Madden so i figured I would give Sega another chance After playin NBA 2K6 I have trully become addicted It s really sad because i skip work to play this wonderful game However with the many pros of NBA 2k6 thier are also a few cons Pros wonderful graphics Superb gameplay realistic from the very start Cons Learn to use directional passing or be a ball hog because you will have a lot of tunovers otherwise The soundtrack is horrible but you can just put the tv on mute until you start playing a game Dunks are also not as flashy as nba live but you won t care much The bottom line GO GET THIS GAME NOW STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND PURCHASE THIS GAME PRONTO IF YOU HAVE IT GET ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW BREAKS THROW NBA LIVE IN THE TRASH OR TRADE IT IN FOR THIS GAME END OF STROY 
I dunno guys After playing the big three b ball games for 06 NBA Live NBA 2K6 and NBA 06 The Life and reading the reviews posted here for each I m still not convinced about much of anything other than the makers of these games got a bunch of our hard earned dollars for giving us very little as far as quality gaming To wit 1 NBA Live 06 This series should be fantastic but seems to keep taking major steps backwards with every new release Horrible graphics annoying bugs crash crash crash inferior gameplay and nothing new under the sun Heck instead of extra s like 2K6 s street ball all we ve got included here is the lame retro Live version from what ten years ago C mon Is anybody even going to play this Compare EA s NBA franchise with their innovative and exciting Madden series Not even close I know pro football brings in the big bucks and the NBA is barely a close second but maybe EA needs to switch their development teams around for next years installments 2 NBA 06 The Life Ugh Nice idea absolutely horrible awful crappy execution Everything other than the premise is garbage Speaking of instead of buying this stinker I should ve just tossed my money in the garbage I can t even trade it in none of the secondhand dealers around PDX want to take it 3 NBA 2K6 Now here I had hope The game includes pretty much all the nifty stuff I want out of a basketball sim but the overall package is still somewhat lacking The interface is NOT very user friendly and the overall graphics look like they were lifted from five year old product I can create a player but how do I get that player onto a roster No clue The menu doesn t give me a hint I ve pressed every button I can think of with no results and the instruction book is no help here And why once I create a player from the roster portion of the main menu can t I use that player in the 24 7 section of the game Why do I have to spend more time doing it all over again And sorry guys but the player graphics in the game are just okay the players in the cutaways look like they re made out of rubber and the detail in the actual games is lousy the courts in NBA Live are much more realistic although the fans here perform like well fans especially during the cut sequences after a ref s whistle and a stop in play they celebrate with high five s boo bad calls etc The courts and menu graphics however look like something from well a game from five or six years ago And the actual basketball even though the play is a bit more realistic than NBA Live s it s still only adequate and using the right joystick for shot control is worse than making a guess HOWEVER At twenty bucks it s the cheapest of the bunch so I didn t feel like I was investing in a fake diamond mine in Africa There s so many nifty options to keep this game fresh with the deep sim franchise mode and the 24 7 streetball mode the average gamer should be happy just playing ball and the rest of us who ve played our fair share of b ball can keep some interest after dunking our way through a couple seasons I like that there are stats like crazy that there s total control and in depth franchise simulation right down to the last details like creating your franchise s GM building a custom franchise or designing your players shoes and that the computer controlled players actually DO something in games and play like their real life counterparts the big men claim rebounds I love that I can tie up the opposing teams ball handler and the ref s actually call jump balls Although I can win a tip but not claim the ball after The commentary may be the best ever in a b ball sim do whatever you need to keep Kenny Smith on board this project and is rarely repetitive I like the replay and player cutaways during the game and crazy enough I ve been missing having an actual halftime show in NBA Live instead of just getting a menu with stats remember when EA used real dancer photo s during halftime Liked that a lot but guess I ll take the silly animated cheerleaders here instead All in all I d say this is a toss up between the two big boys Since I ve played the NBA Live franchise for so long I d hope to see EA take a lesson from 2K6 and make the jump to this level of gaming simulation and then a step or two further Or on the flip side for 2K6 to incorporate the stuff EA does right and improve on it THEN maybe we ll finally have a basketball simulation worth the twenty or thirty or fifty bucks we fans keep shelling out year after year 
Fun game bad graphics The basketball aspect of this game is a little more fun than NBA Live 2006 just because the refs do not constantly interupt gmaeplay But graphic wise this game has the worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 I m talking about the PS2 version But the close up graphics are very good My faveorite part of the game is that you can even do a fantasy draft on play now mode But if you are a basketball fan you really should get this it is extremely fun 
Best Sim Basketball Game Out There First off I own both NBA 2K6 and NBA Live 2006 and have been playing both since they have come out At first I thought that NBA Live 2006 was a better game until I played NBA 2k6 more and more and realized that it was the best simulation basketball game out there The addition of the shot stick to this year s game changes the way you shoot as well as play the game The game is very enjoyable especially with friends because some of the games can get very intense Overall the game is probably the best in the series because it made a major improvement over ESPN 2k5 Pros Graphics are the best of any basketball game on the PS2 to date Free throws more realistic in that you must have a fluid motion as if you were shooting the free throw yourself VIP is very extensive and detailed to show your stats and tendecies which is a very nice touch to those that pay attention to detail such as myself Cons Steals happen way too often Very challenging to get 15+ rebounds Practice mode is still relatively useless other than to perfect your timing on your shot 
You want a worthy adversary I ll GIVE you a worthy adversary Kyle Katarn was once a Jedi Knight He once helped the fledgling New Republic in its strugle against the Empire Until Drommund Kaas when he confronted the darkness in himself and gave in to it So he gave up his lightsaber to Luke Skywalker swearing never to touch the Force again He went back to working as a New Republic mercenary alongside Jan Ors the only other person in the galaxy who knew the location of the fabled Valley of the Jedi and the incalculable power it contained He might have lived the rest of his life that way with only his blaster his wits and Jan the woman he loved to count on Until they took one mission that ended all that They met Desann a powerful Dark Jedi and his apprentice Tavion They along with Admiral Galak Fyyar an Imperial scientist are trying to find a way to artificially infuse the Force into living subjects to mass produce their own army of Dark Jedi Needless to say they succeed and it s all Kyle s fault So what s a former Jedi to do Simple Take back your Force abilities reclaim your lightsaber and go hunting This game did a great job of improving on the combat and Force powers of the original JEDI KNIGHT Your Force abilities are taken directly from the movies with none of the showy powers you saw in the original You end up with eight in all four neutral two light and two dark but they re selected for you automatically You can t upgrade them as freely as you could before The lightsaber combat is vastly improved they used motion capture to animate Kyle and his enemies and it shows Even the lightsabers themselves look better like they were taken directly from the movies The enemies are just what you d want in a STAR WARS game They basically fall into three categories Imperials bounty hunters and the Reborn The Imperials range from stormtroopers killing them NEVER gets old officers droids and engineers The bounty hunters are from four different races Rodians Grans Trandoshans and Weequay and they re pretty much interchangable But the Reborn oh boy are THEY a challenge The Reborn are the result of Admiral Fyyar s experiements in artificially stimulating midichlorian production They re all Dark Jedi and they re all insane from the process You ll want to pay attention to what color they re wearing when you fight them orange and blue aren t so bad green is tougher but red and black Be ready for a FIGHT And that s not even counting the Shadowtroopers The boss enemies are nicely varied as well Reelo Baruk the criminal connection is nothing Admiral Fyyar with his shielded power armor is like a walking tank Tavion and Desann are VERY crafty those two are the toughest enemies in the game Fortunately you won t be completely alone Jan Ors fights alongside you briefly as do Republic soldiers and fellow Jedi Knights Raven Software even had the brilliant idea of bringing in Lando Calrissian voiced by Billy Dee Williams HIMSELF and Luke Skywalker to back you up In fact fighting alongside Luke is one of the game s high points the two of you are squaring off against both stormtroopers and Reborn in one area My only complaint is that it was over WAY too soon The locales are just as eclectic as you d expect from a STAR WARS game or movie for that matter You go from an abandoned Imperial listening post to a crystal mine under Imperial control to Nar Shaddaa Bespin an asteroid base an Imperial Star Destroyer even Yavin 4 home of the Jedi Academy itself And every location find new ways to challenge you no matter what powers or weapons you have at the time But once again it s the story that pulls you in more than anything else The continuing story of what happens to the New Republic after the movies is compelling enough I think we all wonder what happened after RETURN OF THE JEDI but framing it around the events of Kyle Katarn s life puts YOU right there in the middle of it all Kyle s a fascinating character make no mistake kind of like a hybrid of Luke and Han Solo but YOU RE the one directing the action YOU RE slugging it out with stormtroopers YOU RE slinging a lightsaber against Dark Jedi YOU RE a Jedi Knight And that s the best selling point I can think of 
The Force is with this Masterpiece Graphically this game is a work of art The shiny surfaces glowing lightsabers and vibrant colors make this a winner As far as gameplay those you can even forget the graphics This gameplay is so good you could play it with terrible graphics and still have an aweseome time The score by John Williams is another highlight The music enhances the tension action and drama of this game Overall this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played 
Still Playing After All These Years This was the 2nd game I purchased for my Macs and it s the only one I still play It really is that good The story is original and well executed the voice actors are excellent and the gameplay is fun The graphics may not be state of the art these days but they are subtle and more believable when compared to many of today s games which rely overmuch on special lighting effects Some of the puzzles are frustrating but once learned you find they are really quite easy The jumping puzzles and chasms can result in deadly falls but hey who said the galaxy was a safe place Hone your force jumping skills And your other Force powers You ll need them The cinematics are well done and really carry the story forward as they segue you into the next level The John Williams score is used effectively If you like being immersed in the Star Wars universe this game is for you The game is based on the Quake 3 Arena engine so it plays really smoothly on any new hardware Even older iBooks like the G3 I had perform well enough to play Jedi Outcast On my PowerBook the game flies The multiplayer game is good with the standards Capture The Flag and other team play but it really shines in Jedi Duel where the fights are one on one with the winner remaining to fight the next player on the server This is pure Star Wars light saber dueling and it takes skill and finesse to be a good duelist if one doesn t use cheats that is I wish LucasArts would release more games like Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast Jedi Academy was good but was more like an expansion to Jedi Outcast Jedi Academy did pick up at the end though and the Dark Side ending leaves plenty of room for a new Jedi Knight game with Kyle Katarn hunting down his wayward apprentice 
An underrated Star Wars game Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series INTRODUCTION I ve pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars and as you may have guessed I m a fan of many of the games based on the series Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss when one succeeds it usually succeeds beautifully One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces released for the Playstation One and the PC Although the game itself was horrendous with a terribly choppy framerate and very poor level design it was something the world had never seen before a Star Wars first person shooter The sequel Jedi Knight cleaned up a lot of the problems and added in some new innovations And now the third game in the series Jedi Outcast has arrived Like previous games in this sub series it has gotten a multi console release Read on to see how it fares OVERVIEW Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first person shooter The game has a one player quest as well as several different multiplayer modes REVIEW To put it simply this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been While not perfect this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn the agent from the other Dark Forces titles The second Death Star has been destroyed but many Imperial forces still fight on so it s up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them The graphics are for the most part solid I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game Nothing state of the art but they re still pretty damn good Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber The single player mode is extremely entertaining and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package And you can save whenever you want to in the single player mode But of course the game isn t perfect Like earlier Dark Forces games the level design just is not that good Too many areas look alike and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into Likewise in many cases your objectives are unclear and some of the puzzles are a pain I don t know about you but I buy first person shooters to shoot people not solve puzzles Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design it took me over an hour just to beat the first level Another huge problem is availability Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game This is a huge problem since the game s limited control selections will often clash with what you re used to for this sort of game This game wasn t released on the Gamecube in very high quanitites so you re gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy and in my mind it s NOT worth that price Sad but true I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans just be warned that it s not perfect and it s hard to get a copy EDITION NOTES This is a good game but for some strange reason it just wasn t available on the Gamecube for very long Because of this even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game Still you should hunt it down if you re into this sort of thing OVERALL Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub series thusfar Where the game succeeds it succeeds beautifully I am impressed with the game it s just a shame the Gamecube version was not made readily available to all would be players I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan 
Let s travel back in time to when Lucasarts was a good company Today Lucasarts is nothing but a greedy company that cares nothing about its customers and I can t same I m impressed with George Lucas these days either But anyway when Jedi Outcast hit stores Lucasarts was the best gaming company in existance They had a NICE CEO unlike the one they have now One who actually CARED about us gamers I m sorry I m really ranting here In Jedi Outcast the 2nd best game in history second only to KOTOR you play an ex Jedi named Kyle Katarn The story takes place about 10 years or so after Return of the Jedi and Kyle Katarn you have given up your lightsaber and Force powers in fear of falling to the Dark Side But the Republic needs you so you must train to become a Jedi again and face your destiny There are many interesting and cool characters in the game like the fat Rodian garbage collector Reelo Baruk and your companion Jan Ors Not to mention the master of the Sith Desann and his apprentice Tavion Also the multiplayer mode is FANTASTIC The only problem is no one is ever playing I play by myself with AI bots and its still really fun You can be stormtroopers with lightsabers The single player is amazing too The storyline is somewhat confusing but interesting all the same The graphics are pretty impressive for a 2002 game and the combat system is nicely done I love slashing the arms of of stormtroopers What fun Yes its true you only use a blue single bladed lightsaber in the game BUT NEVER FEAR I have discovered a cheat to change your blade color First hold SHIFT and hit located to the left of the 1 key This will bring up the console Type devmapall no quotes and hit enter Next type sabercolor x where X is what color your saber can be Here are the colors orange yellow red blue green and purple Enjoy that one While cheating always do devmapall first It enables the cheats My all time favorite cheat is g_saberrealisticcombat 3 I won t tell you what it does Find out for yourself by killing an enemy But its funny Don t worry it doesn t crash the game I wouldn t do that to you I first discovered the wonders of Outcast when I played it at my cousins house We sat there for hours having fun and screwing with the cheats And that s also really cool cheating does not mess up the game in any way shape or form unlike many other games In other games you cheat it has a price Usually an expensive one In Outcast you cheat its FREE There is one problem I have with this game and that is the glitches There aren t many that affect gameplay but sometimes the walls are flashing and it gets sorta annoying My cousin who has beaten the game at least 10 times has discovered many glitches including a room where Tavion is standing and you can walk through her a room filled with lights contained three floating AT STs and even a room with mountains painted on the ceiling I actually found the last one But its kind of fun discovering these weird rooms There are quite a lot of them Wow just writing this makes me want to play the game I m gonna go play it I remember when Outcast was 49 99 Now the price has gone down 40 00 NOWS YOUR CHANCE BUY THIS GAME 
Xbox DVD Kit I know that many of you probably had DVD players before you picked up an Xbox That s simply the case with early adopters However that doesn t mean you should automatically skip the Xbox remote Firstly you need a remote control kit for playback You cannot simply stick in a DVD and start monkeying around with a controller Sorry There are several remotes to choose from but the official model is comfortable and well laid out If you ve ever used an RCA remote than you can guess how it feels and how it s organized I would guess that for many readers their Xbox is a secondary DVD player Small easy to use and relatively affordable the remote adds much value to your big black bo 
Do NOT buy Substitutes Buy the original Buy the original Microsoft XBOX DVD Remote I bought a substitute from Game Liquidation and after only 10 movies the receiver transmitter stopped working I did not get a refund although I returned the product The original remote is GREAT No problems so far and I have seen dozens of movies satisfaction guaranteed 
Works Great All of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy TV s I mean it could be that I have a 20 inch Sony Trinitron and the Halo special edition XBOX too but I have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends in real life or anyone in my CounterStrike Clan on XBOX Live that have old TV s and regular XBOXes RECCOMENDATION If the picture is crappy buy a new TV 
Good Challenging Game This isn t your typical run through game you actually have to think and take risk at times It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that s the thing I like most about it I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy My only flaws were the default controls those were a pain I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn t that bad This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels like Level Skip because it gets pretty tough but I didn t have to do that much maybe twice Anyways this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there 
FUN BUT EXTREMELY HARD FIRST OF ALL I AM A BIG STAR WARS FAN AND THIS GAME ROCKS BUT YOU MUST BE REALLY CLEVER AOMETIMES THE LEVELS ARE SO HARD I HAD TO YOUS CHEATS TO UNLOCK THE OTHER LEVELS BUT THEN I BEAT THE OTHERS P S CAN SOMEONE HELP ME I M ON YAVIN FINAL CONFLICT AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE THREE PLACES TO GO I8 HAVE KNOW IDEA WHTA TO DO BECAUSE IPUT OUT THE FIRE AND THEN PUSHED THE WALLS BACK AND NOW DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO PLEASE HELP ME 
Great star wars title This is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging don t listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard the people who claim it s to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get s to the point where you want to throw the game out the window This is a good game and I highly recomend it to and star wars fan p s don t buy jedi academy that game is horrible what a shame to ruin the series like that 
tHiS gAmE rOcKs I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer Back then I had a really slow computer and it didn t work right I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years Now I have a better computer and play it all the time The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult not so The guy must have obviously been a moron and not been able to figure out the puzzles because the game has an average difficulty and if he wants it easier he can play on Padawan Anyway the game is basically a first person shooter based game where you go around blasting storm troopers probe droids and more I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it and I want to get it for XBOX too 
Dumb Boring And Extreamly Hard I think its safe to say that this game sucks Before I got this game I thought it would be great I had heard so many good things about it Once I got it though I realized that this game wasnt as great as everyone said it would be The Graphics are ok but the gameplay and sound dont impress me at all Plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes As for all the talk about you being able to use the force the force is pretty weak in this game You also dont get the force until level 7 and on some of the missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning push pull ect Really the only good force power is grip Grip allows you to choke people Another thing that sucks is that there are different powers of the force so when you finally get the force you have to build up your power of the force for a few levels wich could take hours to finally get your force power strong enough to kill the enemy not just wound him This game is also EXTREAMLY hard Its like Metroid Prime were you can get lost and it ll take a long time to find your way around If you still want to get this game after reading this review is suggest renting it first Dont Be Dumb like me and buy it without renting it I wasted 50 
EXCELLENT GAME Hi I love Nancy Drew and I think this is Herinteractive s best game since Danger on Deception Island I highly not to mention strongly recommend this game In this game you get to snorkle for shells to make hawaiin neclaces fish for ulua hawaiin shore fish and more Most people think The creature of Kapu cave is the worst Nancy Drew Don t believe them People who complain that it s a short game actually print a walkthrough zip through the game and then start complaining Herinteractive has even created new features 1 You can switch from Joe Hardy to Frank Hardy and to Nancy Drew by calling each character on their cellphone 2 You can change the design of the control panel on the bottom of the screen 3 Go snorkeling for shells to make beautiful necklaces to trade for Big Island Bucks 4 Program your GPS Global Postitioning System to navigate from rainforests to even Kapu cave 5 Explore the Hilihili research facility 6 Look through the boss of Hilihili s stuff while he is in the same room snoozin I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME 
Lots of New Features In The Creature of Kapu Cave Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys work together to solve a mystery surrounding the dying pineapple crops in Hawaii the possible relation between this and the top secret scientific work being done nearby the family who owns a vacation excursion center Nancy is there working with an entomologist bug scientist the Hardy Boys are in Hawaii to do some detective work on the family who runs the excursion center The locals believe that a mytholocial creature has been angered is therefore responsible for the dying crops are they right If not who else could be behind it why This ND game has several new features First you go back forth playing both Nancy Drew the Hardy Boys with each being responsible for different parts of the story Also through the use of a GPS you drive wherever you need to go Although I thought the graphics were great I didn t like the fact that I couldn t stay in any one area for very long once you do 1 or 2 things you have to move on to another place or do an identity switch between Nancy the Hardy s Because of this there wasn t too much to explore in any one place Overall I really liked playing The Creature of Kapu Cave but I would have enjoyed it more had I been able to explore each area more wasn t forced to move from place to place so quickly 
Great game if anyone has played any of the final fantasy games then im sure they would love it It dosent have the greatest graphics but it is sure worth playing The only thing that made me want to pull out my hair was how long the begining was 
A moving story Graphics 7 10 Well we are talking about a PS1 port So don t expect much here But the new CGs are nice and even the old PS1 sprites are actually pretty nicely animated And the super special moves PWS are rather nice too Sound 6 10 The dialoguing is very annoying at first It s very much apparent the moment you start up the game when you have to go through the prologue Once you get used to it it s not bad The sound effects seem a bit primitive too but again this is a rather old game Btw as the fans will quickly note the game uses the same voice actors as Pokemon D Gameplay 7 10 It s an interesting mix of platforming puzzles turn based and real time combat Personally I did not enjoy the platforming part That genera was never my favorite and the PSP s diagonal insensitivity makes some of the jumps a pain to do The combat is rather fun and original But after about mid game your characters are so over leveled and over equipped almost all of the battles except for a few boss battles become trivial Replay 8 10 There s a lot to do here And the chances are that on your first game you ve missed out the A ending the true ending The standard B ending is pretty mundane And there are quite a few characters in the game and you probably will not get to explore all of them until you replay the game Personally I m a story driven player so once I know the plot I have little interest in replaying the game but I think many players don t mind going through the story again and for such players the replay value should be fairly high Story 9 10 A most excellent story The many characters that you come across have rather poignant stories and you learn that each of them are small reflections of your main character The plot is weaved very nicely although it is somewhat slow in the beginning My only negative that s keeping this from being a 10 10 is the very last scene it somewhat left me unfulfilled But I hear that s a matter of opinion 
A good game but VERY SHORT I found 007 Agent Under Fire a good game but it was too short just 5 hours long The missions were fun and you get to drive the tricked out James Bond cars with the machine guns and the rockets and a whole lot of gadgets the watch laser and the list goes on The missions are fun especially when you are driving the Soviet T 80 and using the gaulting gun with the 80 MM gun barrell killing the bad guys The missions take you all over the world to Romania the UK embassy in Hungary and the list goes on A good game but it could of been better 
John Scott 9 year old gamer bye itThis is the best game ever made it beats night fire by a long shot night fire is a fun 2 player game but the missonssuck its the best bye it 
Very novel idea One of the more interesting video game ideas that I ve seen in a long time The Japanimation style is very cool and the gameplay is very engrossing Using the stylus pen to perform medical procedures is shockingly addictive and frequently very challenging 
kind of hard but fun I bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds The beginning went well the operations are fun The story drags a little and goes too slow i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations The operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful i am stuck on the 6th one i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now but continuously fail Unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further 
DS + jobs= good TEH HELL This is a really fun game It s got quite a lot Graphics length characters story Graphics 8 10 Dayum Reminds me of Dating Sims But nice The characters are crisp and have the special ingredient known as anime eyes Sound 7 10 The voices or lack of are nice The scolding of the nurse is kinda funny The music isn t that nice Theirs only about 4 different music thingys and I only liked one The one that plays when doing normal GUILT Story 8 10 I wish I could ve done normal surgeries for awhile before encountering a super parasite thing based off of the 7 deadly sins Controls 9 10 It s the DS Touch drag touch again Pretty simple Overall 9 10 A nice game that s easy to understand and hard to master But this is NOT a game for kids The blood isn t that bad and there isn t that much gore but it is a very hard game to beat And there s a suicidal patient which my mother didn t really like =\ 
Inventive and fun Of all the games on the DS no other third party title has made this good of use of the stylus and touch screen than Atlus Trauma Center Under the Knife Playing as a young inexperienced surgeon you use the stylus to cut suture bandage and more in an effort to save your patients You have a certain amount of time to do these tasks as well as keeping an eye on your patient s vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards and re starting the heart of a flatliner There s a storyline to Trauma Center but it s only here as a way to make the game move along The highlight of the game and what makes it worth picking up is the fact that this is one of the titles that makes the DS the best portable system out there today The level of interactivity is inituitive but the game loses steam because it is ultimately too short After completeing each surgery you ll be able to re play them to boost your surgeon rating which is a nice little bonus in itself All in all Trauma Center Under the Knife is a definite must check out for all DS owners but keep in mind that the game isn t for everyone 
Not sure who this game is geared towards This is one of those games that can fall into multiple age catagories On one hand it looks purely like a kiddie game with cutesy poo characters and a Saturday morning cartoon feel On the other hand the dialog lots of it in this game is purely for adults with quite a few tongue in cheek risque jokes comments and situations WARNING Possible spoilers in next sentence Like what Beatrice does with the scuba gear and the main character getting high on mushrooms The cases are not very easy yet not very hard Some stories are so childish that I felt embarresed to be playing the game and some are so funny that I had to call someone over to read what was on the screen Then I was embarresed once again because I was asked why I was playing a little girl game That s the kind of game this is In short and regardless of the who the hell was this game made for dilemma I highly recommend it to anyone any age It s HIGHLY addictive extremely well written and a high quality point and click presentation 
Wonderful and Delightful Quite simply it s great though a bit on the challenging side Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it s rated E for everyone approach will appeal to adults as well as kids It s not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad Ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up Replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a touch list If you like adventure titles like Phoenix Wright and Trace Memory or Maniac Mansion for that matter then you ll really dig this game A good solid four stars 
Touch Detective This is a fun game to play I am on the 2nd mystery to solve I do love these types of games This one is sort of like Trace Memory alot of reading to do in it I am an adult woman My 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though 
True Review First off lemme just say that I am a nintendo fan I have been since I first got a NES system at years old in 1988 I have had every Nintendo home console since then and loved it I bought a GC in 2002 and really fell in love with it I eventually traded it with my brother for a computer dumb move Years later i bought another one used from a friend but never played it b c of school and sold it Well its 2006 and I am buying a gamecube as of today b c i miss it so much even after getting into PC games like World of Warcraft and Half Life Here s why 1 The system It is flawless I have never seen this system lock up or malfunction it reads every disk fine I clearly plays many multiplatform games such as Resident Evil 4 and Timesplitters 2 the best I like PS 2 games but the console itself is crap and a few good games on a console doesn t really give me enough reason to keep having to rebuy one b c they crap out XBOX is a good system but the games are nothing you can t really have on PS 2 besides Halo and KOTOR 2 The games Sure there are a lot of kid games on this system But there are many Teen and Mature games too many are available but aren t as obvious to find What is so amazing about the games are not only the truely wonderful one like Metroid Prime Zelda Mario RE4 etc but all of the great games that nobody ever really plays as much You will find many of these games on GC and they are cheap and probably more fun than most games you will ever play on any other console Some of these include Eternal Darkness Die Hard Vendetta wow i loved this game and there was zero advertising for it that i know of Killer 7 Agent Under Fire not as underground necessarily but this game is amazing Phantasy Star Online 1 2 Soul Caliber 2 etc If you really are into first person shooters don t even bother with XBOX Play PC games they are better graphically and seem easier to handle on a keyboard in my opinion If you want a load of fighting games like Tekken or Street Fighter PS 2 is good but like i said that system is really horrible designed even the new slimlines have problems Honestly I would pick up a PS 1 on ebay if you wanna play some great fighters like Tekken or King of Fighters If you want the best gameplay out of games for a great price get a gamecube I m telling you I know what your thinking You walk into a video store see Pikmin or Super Mario sunshine on gamecube and think psh what am i years old Looks can be deceiving and this system is amazing in all games and honestly pikmin had me rolling on the ground it was so oddball and fun I give the gamecube easily 5 stars it s never let me down for what it was meant for great games 
easy this game is alot of fun you get to play as a whole lot of places explore and beat pepole up finishing the game is easy expecially when you play multiplayer the only parts that are hard is where you haft to beat the fairygodmother at the end some levles you might find boring like the one with the three little pigs so i would recommend you buy this at a cheap price 
Fun For the Family I am the mother of four I have three boys ages 2 4 6 and a little girl age 3 This game has been fun for all of us You can play up to four players and the game is fun to watch as well as play My older boys have had so much fun playing this game for hours and hours We ve won the game countless times and started over again from scratch The game has many levels and lots of tasks to do The graphics are great and the challenges are fun My four year old has a little trouble with some of the harder parts but my six year old is able to take the lead with ease Great game for family fun cheering each other on and playing a game with the familiar faces of characters they love in the movies It s a bonus that with each level the four characters change to make it more interesting 
Morrowind is fun and well worth the money I purchased a copy of the Game of the Year Edition at the end of May 2006 It is now almost September I have been playing Morrowind for three months most week day evenings for about 4 hours and most weekends for about 12 hours The game has great graphics the character interaction is fairly intricate though at times repetitive the game AI for the monsters and non player characters is fairly advanced the game manipulation was fairly easy to learn the layers of complexity can be somewhat challenging though not overwhelming and most importantly the one or two puzzles I have come across thus far were straightforward to resolve Most of the various quests are not terribly intricate and difficult to do so they lend themselves to jumping on for a few hours and then taking a break I wanted a game that would be visually appealing with simple game manipulation mechanics interesting but easy puzzles mysteries and above all to provide an immersive virtual world to explore And I wanted an inexpensive game and that would run on an older 900Mhz AMD Thunderbird with an NVIDIA FX5200 128MB video card and 1 GB of RAM Morrowind fits the bill nicely I have ignored all of the FAQs and manuals about how to play the game as most of those provide spoilers and instructions as to the most opportune or expedient path I have discussed the game with some of my students who have moved on to Oblivien the fourth game in the series All in all this was the best 20 bucks I have ever spent on a game Previous to this I have played Call of Duty and Civilization II extensively and some other strategy games a bit I did play Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends in college some 20 years ago so the fantasy ideas embedded in the game are familiar 
Morrowwind A Mr Craig Clotfelter wrote a review earlier that matches my sentiments exactly If you can get used to the controls and get by the early slowness this is an excellent game I havent beaten it yet and havent played it for a month or so computor went down you can do the main quest straight on or wander around building your character up I personally didnt start the main till I was about level 13 and even then took it slow and easy As you progress in the game ar wander the area new towns open up and I just sort of got new side quests as these areas opened up So I am taking my time It is a great game If you buy it and have patience you wont regret it 
One of the best RPG s ever I d have to start off saying that Morrowind has been one of the most unique RPG s I ve played It s been at least as immersive and engaging as Baldur s Gate 2 or Planescape Torment The developers accomplished what they wanted to to make a game where one can do as he she pleases There are countless ways to play through this game Playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character The world is huge and it takes hours upon hours to explore There s so much that if you don t stop and turn around sometimes you re bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave Now about some technical things I m running this game on a P4 2 53 ghz 768mb PC2700 memory GeForce4 4200 Ti GPU The game runs great at 1024x768 resolution with full shadows and distance Since the graphics are a little dated and I more than excede the recommended system I ve chosen to install sevaral mods which is another great way to keep this game fresh Most notably the Better Bodies Better Heads and Morrowind Comes Alive The first 2 make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic The Morrowind Comes Alive adds many more NPC s generic travelers to ones that have something to offer be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot at random places giving the game even more of an immersion factor Over all I highly recommend this game In fact I bought it to keep me from wanting to play World of Warcraft and it s worked 
Perhaps the best 20 bucks I ever spent Where to begin There is so much to say about this game because there is so much to do This game is massive I just recently picked it up and I cannot believe I waited this long to play it I heard a lot of good things about Morrowind from friends and online reviews it is confirmed I am hooked on this games There are a few important things to point out about it however as this game is definitly not for everyone Yes this is an adventure RPG and a massive one It is not in the same format as games such as Final Fantasy Chrono Trigger Star Ocean ect sure it takes quite some time to get to your destination if you have to travel a long distance but this game is in real time and the island is massive not to mention there are so many lairs scattered around the world which makes for a TON of exploration on top of your already robust agenda The character customization in this game is on par if not better than all other character customization tools I have used in a single player PC RPG With this in mind this game takes at least some commitment I have been able to advance my Nord Battle Mage just fine even though I have somewhat of a busy schedule you do not need to have 24 hours free but it is still good to play it when you can because it has a habit of calling out to you saying play me play me it is adicting You choose your own path in this game If you are into fantasy character development a real time environment and a sense of adventure this game just may be what you are looking for 
Best RPG Definitely Best Game Ever Maybe Part of the Elder Scrolls series Morrowind takes the live action adventure of games like the Zelda series and overlays it with a more traditional role playing stat system ala Dungeons and Dragons To elaborate the player can freely explore the expansive 3D world in first person or third person mode while practicing and improving their character s skill set In combat for example rather than trying to work your way through a menu system trying to cast magic and use attack moves etc Final Fantasy anyone the player must physically aim and swing a sword or fire a spell at his opponent Whether or not the bow lands is based on things like the player s agility and the bad guy s block skill Thus unlike in a game such as say Fable the action doesn t depend as much on the player s own reflexes and dexterity A little common sense and caution goes a long way Also don t expect lots of elaborate teary eyed cut scenes like in story driven games such as Final Fantasy The real draw to this game is the complete freedom the player has to be whoever they want go anywhere they like and do almost anything within reason The player is asked to choose a name race gender face and hairstyle for their character and also to create a basic skill set to use any combination from combat magical and stealth categories Then the player is given some simple instructions for beginning the first task of the main quest and is simply released into a massive world of towns people and wilderness There is a main quest to follow but the gameplay is completely open ended It s easy to become completely distracted by and caught up in the endless guild quests and random adventures that await your character Personally I ve been playing this game for about two and a half years now and I ve still not accomplished everything there is to do in this game I m not sure that I can even describe the depth of this game in this review I ve literally spent hours just trying on different clothes and armor creating my own spells and potions or reading the books both factual and fictional in the game s libraries and I d like to add that almost anything read about in a book can be found or done in the game I ve also spent literally days of gameplay searching for the various legendary and unique artifacts and trying to uncover the various mysteries of the game such as solving the disappearance of the dwarves finding the cure for vampirism locating or becoming a werewolf and how to become a necromancer some of which I ve found or am close to finding I ve played most if not all the Zelda games I ve played Fable I ve played games like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy and I ve even played text rpg s like ADOM They all have their good points and advantages and I ve greatly enjoyed them all but none of them not even Majora s Mask have held my attention this long The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is the best role playing game I ve ever played and maybe just maybe the best game I ve ever played overall 
I love this game I love this game It s not too hard for kids to play my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets and it s not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it s also cool so us adults can play as well I love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like Jesse James and the Jester etc The graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also 
THUG 2 A breakthrough in skateboarding and general sports games Now I m new to the Tony Hawks s series in fact the only time I ve played it before THUG was in a demo which I enjoyed but not so much the tasks of collecting the letters and stuff like that even though for those who love that type of stuff they have a classic version of the original Tony Hawks in THUG 2 These games offer the ever insightful approach of exploring your world on and off the skateboard Especially THUG 2 since THUG I returned it on the same day I got it for Christmas merely because I felt dizzy until I got the same feeling for THUG 2 but then I realised you got all songs not just rock but hip hop as well as few others Anyways the story is intriguing and you travel the world doing various tasks such as breaking pipes and skating combos in a church The possibilities are endless plus for you alien lovers out there you can unlock an outer space world plus many others In short not the best review you ve seen true but the game is much more to than just skating which is great did I mention you can switch characters from Tony himself to Bigfoot Dila 
Not at all a bad game THUG 2 Came out last year and was a pretty popular game What I liked about the game is how they included older levels with updated graphics The game doesn t last long you can easily beat it but if you re a huge fan you can still play for hours on end even after it s beaten You can play online too which is a lot of fun and I think it adds to the excellence of this game more so THPS or THUG fan Buy this 
Its an ok game I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok 
A Good Investment Two great RPG s in one package Playstation owners who began Final Fantasy with the 7th installment can finally see what all the hype is about with VI Final Fantasy V is also a great game the first in the series where you spend alot of time in the menu combining abilities with accessories equipment to customize your characters The only downside is the short load times when entering battles opening the menu entering new levels However these never last more than a few seconds Whether you re discovering the SNES generation of Final Fantasy for the first time or re visiting the classics Final Fantasy Anthology offers a great gaming experience that you can only get on a console 
Nice package This is a nice package of my two favorite Final Fantasy games Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy V Final Fantasy V has never seen release here and I feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original Japanese version Final Fantasy VI has been restored to its original glory in this version and it s a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original Final Fantasy VI title with Tina Terra in Magitek armor I highly recommend this collection 
Final Fantasy Anthology I love this game I had it for SNES and it is one of my favorite 
Greatest Hits version is lackluster Don t get me wrong both games in Anthology are excellent I would consider Final Fantasy VI to be the greatest RPG ever created But the Greatest Hits version of this package does dissapoint The original black label version of Anthology was created by SquareSoft and included in the package was an extra CD with music from both games However the black label edition has been out of print for some time The newly formed company Square Enix decided to re release Anthology as a Greatest Hits but excluded the music CD in the package So instead of receiving three disks the two gaming disk and one music CD only the two game disks are included with the game The Square Enix release of Anthology feels much more like a cheap cut and paste copy of Final Fantasy Besides lack of the music CD much of the artwork from the previous black label release is gone and instead the gaming disks are designed with a standard white label Final Fantasy Anthology from Square Enix is certainly not a collector s item despite what the package label might say It is my suggestion to pass this purchase up and find a copy of the black label release from SquareSoft 
Probably The Best Game I Ever Owned For The PS1 I no longer play video games though I have recently started back on computergames but I had to review this great set You get two games Fianl Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 First let us look at FF5 FF5 was never released in the states officialy but Squaresoft now called SquareEnix has unleashed it upon us all It s story isn t the greatest but it s not about story here it s all about gameplay This is the main reason that this is my favourite in the series The job class is indepth and gives you a lot of options here This improves upon the already great job class of FF3 not FF6 and only comes insecond to the job class system found in Dragon Warrior 3 and Dragon Warrior 7 I also like the size if this game there are three different worlds here and they are all good size I also love the main villian s name X Death and his final form and name Neo X Death There are a lot more good things that make this game great but I ll let you discover them FF6 is also a solid game and introduced some of the things that would be found in later FF games One thing is the indepth stories and multiple characters to play with Even though a lot fans like to say that FF7 had got the best villian in the series I and many others dissagree Kefka is jst pure evil incarnate I m not going into details so you yourself will have to find all the little things that make him such the awesome bad guy that he is It s just a great game If you don t mind 2 D graphics and old games then do yourself a favoure and get this fine set now 
nothing else can touch it FFVI is the end all best game ever created The story line is simply out of this world The game grips you from the beginning and never lets go The interaction between the main characters is incredible The game creates the most haunting mood of any game ever released despite the now primitive graphics and sound I have gone years without playing the game before but the story environments villains and even some of the music would still stand out in my mind This game simply leaves an impression on you unlike any other video game ever could After playing through it every other game out there just seems void of content No other Final Fantasy installment can touch this one FFVII is a distant second This will likely remain the best game ever created unless it is completely remade with today s technology but even that is questionable as the SNES graphics give an incredible atmosphere to the game anyway My only complaint with this particular title is the result of its adaption to the Playstation The new cinema cut scenes do not come even remotely close to doing this game justice Some of the sound didn t carry over well either and the addition of load times isn t exactly a welcome one Despite these shortcomings it s still the complete game which is all that matters FFVI was absolutely breathtaking in every aspect when it was released and remains so to this day The story the music the characters and the gameplay are still better than anything today s games have to offer Anyone who has yet to experience this incredible adventure is only keeping themselves from one of the most engaging stories ever 
Great Game Totally Fun Yes this game is an easier fighting game but that s why I like it personally In most Marvel fighting games there are so many controls to remember for activating many different types of superpowers that it got hard to keep em straight With this game having only 2 basic fight options for all characters it is much easier to figure out what you are doing Of course each character has it s little extras such as flight for Storm and wall climbing for Spidey so each character remains unique But you don t have to memorize 10 different actions for Wolverine and then memorize 10 different controls for Venom I like this game a lot and I really love that they have made the fighting controls easier 
All RIGHT Phew I m relieved to be able to recommend this game I ve played them all in order And I really didn t enjoy the last two so I was a bit concerned But Her Interactive got a lot of things right in this one Interesting mystery with the puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into the plot Not too much repetition of tasks hooray The only reason it wasn t perfect for me was that I really didn t learn too much My favorite games are the ones where I walk away with a bit more knowledge of something than I had before going in And this one not so much I also had a small objection to the ending The treasure so to speak was completely out of the park There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking And as a history buff I hated seeing such a treasure indeed relegated to the back burner and used as a throw away at the very end 
Nancy Drew I have played several Nancy Drew games and this is by far the best one I recommend this game to anyone 
Clue Chronicles The Fatal Illusion WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLUE CHRONICLES First off you may notice a couple of things 1 This is called Clue CHRONICLES 2 It is refered to as EPISODE 1 sometimes 3 It is a 1999 game with no sequel Why is this Well Clue Chronicles was from Hasbro Interactive and EAI EAI quit the gaming business and Hasbro quit computer games and was left with board games So the promising series was doomed If you enjoy this game I advise you to write into Atari Why Atari Well Hasbro was left with all their computer games They passed all the rights to Infogrames which became Atari So in the complicated and confusing Clue Chronicles Timeline the rights are held with Atari I will and if you like the game you should too write to Atari and ask for a sequel Now for the real review MY REVIEW Clue Chronicles follows the story of 11 unlucky party guests on a mysterious yacht owned by Ian Masque After he drops dead the mystery begins Did a box kill him So it seems Join the old cast Miss Scarlet Mr Green Mrs Peacock Colonel Mustard Professer Plum and Mrs White along with a new cast of characters including Marina Popov Julia Kell Sabata Martin Urfe and for a short time Ian Masque You are a detective Nobody has ever met this man is person what did he want with them and you There is an answer But you need to play the game to find it out With an airtight plot that doesn t stop even after the story ends you will be gasping for breathe at the heartstopping cliffhanger ending MY GRADES Story 10 10 Well thought out with an unexpected ending Gameplay 6 10 Minor Glitches that don t effect the gameplay but involve disappearing characters in the background Soundtrack 9 10 Music mostly fits the scenes VO 9 10 The voiceovers are great except for one small part towards the end Graphics 8 10 Its an old game that about sums it up no FINAL A Will always be a favorite 
Will work for XP This is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game This game works with XP however you need to have a combo drive that includes DVD writer C D Combo writer I have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly 
Short but Sweet Great uncomplicated game with decent graphics and just the right amount of quot spookiness quot I loved the puzzles which weren t overly difficult to solve and the HINT system was very very good in helping me get over one or two puzzles which did not seem to make sense The marble in the hole game was a little irritating but all other puzzles were solvable even on a trial and error basis This game is probably not for people who like complex plots and puzzles but as a game novice I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed when the game ended a little abruptly 
Nice way to continue series NBA ballers phenom is a great game and is really fun to play What midway basically did was advance or fix the original NBA ballers who stared Stephon Marbary Midway made the graphics better gameplay better a litte more extra moves and nice layout The layout looks cool and is way better then how it used to look The reason why I give this game a 4 star rather then 5 star is the loading the game itself Ok I have to admit the loading is pretty long but its all worth it What I mean about the game itself is that its more for teens I mean the whole thing of ballers I am not sure kids under 10 understand what it means and how to bring it in the game The original NBA ballers I would say is more for kids but since midway enhanced this game rather then change the whole thing I would say It is a blast for teens 13+ So what I am getting too is if you are under the age of 12 or 13 wait until AND 1 Streetball comes out But if your over 13 years of age then then go out and grab a copy of this game cause its a blast you 
God of GORE This Game is AWSOME It is way too graphic for kids so parents no matter how much they beg DON T BUY IT Even the story is too adult for them It is a very interesting puzzle action and adventure game If you are a occational gamer set it to easy and dig in because you can get the hang of it with a little practice The puzzles require a little brain power so be ready for vex sometimes 
Non stop action This game is awesome Definately a 10 10 There is constant action and you can upgrade your abilities and weapons to become stronger with added effects If you re into games like Devil May Cry or just love hack n slash you need to pick this one up 
From the video game widow s point of view My husband brought this game home and I thought Oh no I guess we re not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game I caught myself saying Baby aren t you going to play your game This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I m tempted to try it out Everyone not shocked by gore and I mean LOTS of gore should play this game Every game should be this well made 
My 2 cents Okay if you don t know this game rocks by now I feel sorry you so I just want to warn parents that it is violent so please if you have a problem with that don t buy it for your kids otherwise why don t you already have it 
God of War is great This game is great Can t wait for God of War 2 
You ve got to be kidding The games are released as is and for an as is product you should beable to get it as freeware or the amaturish remake Even the DOS BOX emulator that comes with it cannot be opened without a file which you must risk downloading from a third party site rar files do not open by themselves you know Like Vivandi Microsoft is too chincy to develope internal download programs for this job as easily as they could Vivaldi compounds this afrustration by not even putting the install program in for the job You cannot run these games with out the emulator and you cannot use the emulator as it is unopened and zipped up thighter than Paris Hilton s jeans four stars for fun of confounding waste of time trying to config it without getting a virus two for crapola quality of compatiblitiy and it requires XP despite not being able to work IN it Also King s Quest 6 does not include the enhanced windows version which has the better grapics in portraits and animaetoins Who works for Vivandai again 
not quite what I expected The advertising for this collection led me to believe I would be getting these 7 games in their original formats but I was disappointed to find not the original version of KQ1 but the SCI version released in 1990 KQ6 has voice commentary instead of text but you can switch back to text if you like I haven t found any such option for KQ5 so it looks like you re stuck with the voice and no supplemental text either so it gets annoying fast I haven t had a look at KQ4 yet but everything else seems to be the same I ll be glad to play these games without having to wrestle with our old Tandy but I wish they didn t get messed with Especially disappointed with there being no text option for KQ5 
A must for KQ fans but very disappointing quality I ve been counting down until I could get this release and couldn t wait to play all these great games again When I got it and started playing it was fun but the disappointment kept mounting Little things like no manuals you have open a file and or print them yourself not a big deal in itself but come on Vivendi quit being so cheap and no case for the CDs you just get twopaper sleeves make the package look incredibly cheap and low quality Yes these are computer games from the 80s and early 90s but this package could have been put together better The graphics are the same as the originals so I didn t expect any update there I completed KQ6 and 1 with no problems but KQ5 is annoying because you can t go back to text or at least I haven t figured out how The music overpowers what the characters are saying Any of the problems you had with the previous games such as difficult maneuvering remain the same which is to be expected Overall I guess my disappointment comes from the fact that Vivendi COULD have made a really nice package with this added some extras beefed it up included more information stuff like that Especially with how long it took to get this going How many times was the release date pushed back But no it s a bare minimim cheapo production I know it s only 20 but still could have been a lot nicer Still a must for any KQ fan and tons of fun to play but I am ultimately disappointed with this product 
Didn t fix all XP issues I am a huge fan of this series When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy However King s Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release However when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY I could not believe this The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn t even do that properly This was a known problem and they didn t even fix it This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future 
where is King s Quest 8 King s Quest games are classic but why are they not including King s Quest 8 Mask of Eternity I know that it was not well received when it came out I personally liked it But just because it was not well received they won t include it It s part of the series and should be included as well 
Increadible The Perfect Christmas Game I went to my local game store to buy a game to get me into the christmas spirit Obviously when I asked for a christmas game the first thing that the woman behind the counter said was The Polar Express I saw the movie last year and loved it so I immediately bought the game and went home to play it I beat the game in aboout 4 hours went to sleep and when I got up beet it again It wasnt exactly that it was a short game as much as it was totally fun and addictive I m 15 the age where most teenagers play violent video games and I am sorry to say that I am one of them The game blends everything from racing down a snowey mountain to climbing the presents in santas sleigh and flying a blimp To put my review simply this is the best christmas game possible 
Polar Express live the magic every day We just saw the wonderful movie and picked up the game on the way home I m 39 years old and terrible at games This game is sweet and lots of fun Food fights soccer searching for things If I can do it anyone can Merry Christmas one and all 
Dynamic fun This is a great game in which yoiu get caught up in the action It s almost as if you are there 
It takes some getting used to but then it really starts going I love the FPS genre There s just something about running around and blowing things away that relieves the day s stress That said if you re new to the CoD games like I was then there s some adjustment to be had It s not a straight run and gun kind of game For one varying degrees of movement and strategy are required to get at your enemies without getting taken out Second if you re used to a plasma gun with 400 rounds then the frequent reloading of historical weapons will take some getting used to But all this adds to the great interface graphics and especially storyline of this great game I can t wait for Call of Duty 3 
One flaw in multiplayer The only flaw I can find in this game is that the multiplayer isn t very much fun Playing locally with a friend means you just shoot him a lot while he learns the controls No enemy AIs in the maps 
A FPS That Actually Makes Me Sweat I have played Call of Duty 2 through and through I have unlocked all the achievements and now I feel kind of sad I want more This game is simply fantastic from the graphics to the gameplay I actually felt like I was thrown back in time to fight the Nazi Fire fights and be intense since enemy units are not retarded They will use cover effectivly and will even try and get better postioning on you It may seem like no big deal but game developers have been promising smart AI for years and never deleviring until now I unfortunitly do not have the ability to play on Xbox Live so the muliplayer is very limited for me what I have play is fantastic Its not ground breaking and the lack of vehicles is kind of crappy but no big deal Okay if you have an Xbox 360 you might as well get this game Its the best I have played so far 
Awesome I really love this game I m not much of a gamer but I really enjoying playing this one both by myself or in multi player mode 
Good game I like it I think this is a great game and my wife and I are currently addicted to it It s definitely more to the SimCity style of play than the Civilization series though it allows more granular control of your city than SimCity The only Civilization aspect is the research which is enjoyable But other than that there isn t much Civ to CivCity which isn t necessarily bad This game reminds me heavily of a german title Knights and Merchants 1998 but with much better implementation On that note if you find that this game isn t for you try the VERY similar but much easier Glory of the Roman Empire This game is definitely challenging but in a good way Someone complained about small maps the maps get bigger as your progress through the game and the small maps are small for a reason it adds challenge to the game for example there is an island map with limited resources which requires that you build a shipping fleet The interface is generally good but there are some non intuitive things like sending tributes I think the graphics are nice especially the temples but it s definitely not the end all as far as graphics go There are a lot of city beautification enhancements fountains gardens etc that I don t tend to mess with but they are pretty and increase your city s happiness Your citizens will candidly tell you if they think your city is a dump I think they did an excellent job on the citizen interaction amusing yet useful Regarding the game breaking click select bug I m playing at 1024x768 resolution and I barely have any problems with it When I do I simply rotate my map and I m able to select what I want I don t consider the bug to be game breaking or even all that annoying though I m glad they re coming out with a patch to fix it All in all I think the game play is excellent Like all modern games the implementation was rushed nothing that a patch won t fix though I suspect the game will age well and have a high replay value 
Enjoyable Challenging City Builder Set In Ancient Rome with a few bugs Disclaimer I am not employed by or associated in any way with the game s publisher or developer I am just another consumer I put that disclaimer because people have a tendency to point out all the positive game reviews here as planted by the developers That may be true in some cases but not here CivCity Rome is not without it s flaws The mouse cursor bug is a known issue on high resolution settings and the game developers have acknowledged this and will be releasing a patch soon How this slipped by their beta testers is beyond me but I ll agree with some others here it is nearly a game breaker That aside if you love things set in ancient Rome like me and if you love city builder CB PC games like me you ll absolutely love CivCity Rome Don t be fooled by the title the game has absolutely nothing to do with the Civilization series of games It is more like a blend of Caesar III and SimCity with a heavy influence of Stronghold II thrown into the mix I personally have spent many hours playing the game on medium difficulty and I find the interface and in game advisors extremely easy to navigate Some have stated the game s interface is clunky and hard to navigate I would love to know what game they are comparing CivCity Rome to because the interface is slick and very easy to use Graphically the game is beautiful to look at Those who say the graphics are dated are living in a fantasy world Just take a look at the screenshots Admittedly the graphics are not as pretty as those in the upcoming Caesar IV game but they are very well done especially on newer systems The tutorial and the manual were both very generous and well done the in game voice acting is charming and appropriate the gameplay is challenging and addictive and the learning curve is about what you would expect for any city builder I strongly suggest anyone interested in city building games and especially ancient Rome based games to check this game out It is well worth the 40 bucks and you ll get many hours of enjoyment If you have a high resolution monitor you may want to wait for the first patch though Cheers 
someone send this to me in Canada HI tried ordering G2 gold edition online but it won t let me and the retailers here don t have it in their data even So my only options are to get somweone I know in the states to get it for me or to go there myself and try to get it Gothic 2 gold edition Night Of The Raven Thats the one Email me anyone who knows how to get this to me here in Victoria BC alan johnson chumtv com or alj2663 hotmail com thanks a bunc 
One of the top 5 games I have ever played Make no mistake about it this game has more than a few bugs and sudden desktop crashes It is also one of the most immersive and totally enjoyable games I have ever played I am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds if not thousands of video games since the 70 s This game has it all as far as role playing games go One bit of advice about this game is save often save often save often Oh and one more thing be sure to save often 
Best RPG yet Gothic 2 is the only RPG I have ever replayed with the Add on included in this Gold version enhancing and expanding the original game fantastically I live in the UK where this version has still not been released why so to get a copy I had to order it to be sent to a friend in the States who kindly posted it on to me Gothic 2 has a living world where things happen around you and people get on with their lives go to work then the pub maybe cook some food and then home to bed for example as do the animals with prey getting chased by predators Quests are interesting and much more than just take this package to so and so With some faction quests you even get to see and play the other side if you replay the game and say join the guards instead of the merceneries The Add on has some brilliant new areas quests and creatures with the whole thing being wonderfully integrated into the original game The Gothic games are the only games where I have gone and practised my swordplay in the fields as fighting is more than button bashing Fighting is actually fun in these games not something I can say about any others although I have high hopes for Oblivion British gaming magazines have criticised Gothic 2 for you not being able to choose your appearance Who cares when you look believable and your armour and weapons can change Anyway playing in first person is more immersive than third person and then it doesn t really matter what you look like the voices not being very good OK you get to recognize some of the actors voices playing different parts and the final things I don t want to give any kind of spoiler away voices are a bit pants especially for what they are but it doesn t matter because the rest of the game is so good not having enough stats skills to raise and personalise your character OK so there s not a vast range of skills and stats but enough to make you have to choose where to spend your points and to have to specialise so what more do you want Having 50 different skills to choose between instead of 15 say does not make a better game Ultimately if you like RPGs you should buy this game and have many hours of pure fun Maybe you too will decide it s too scary to go out at night and instead find a nice bed you can sleep the night away in or a bench to sit on and admire the view whilst waiting for dawn and some light to see what s coming next 
Good As Gold This game rocks you ve got action storytelling quests your own path linear gameplay and the world is alive people have jobs and work times and play times The controls are a little quirky but worth the hassle 
Simple the best This game run at my computer very well The scenarios and story are very god The price are very chepest and the delivery very speedy 
Fun for Seniors I purchased a Nintendo DS specifically for this game and was not disappointed I m 65 and on a good day can get my brain age into the 30s I gave the game and a DS to an 80 year old friend and she can get into the 40s We both struggle with the test that calls for memorizing from a list of words After learning to play Sudoku in Brain Age I switched to playing it on my Palm Pilot game from Astraware which lets me enter the game from the daily newspaper I ve recently lent my DS to a 6th grader who is learning Sudoku By the way avoid the DS game called Sudoku It s unnecessarily clunky for entering data This is an appropriate game for seniors who like math logic challenges even if they ve never used a computer Plan to spend some time tutoring a newbie and then watch as he or she enjoys the challenge 
Brain Age Works I found this to be a fun game as well as effective I enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and abilty to increase my speed I particularly like it when it got to the level where I could choose which games I wanted to use for my brain age tests Several of the games are going to require more repetitions before I become skillful at them I find that I continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest Carole Adan 
Fun for the roadtrip Since the heady days of arcade favorites such as Asteroids Pac Man and Missile Command people have claimed that video games can help sharpen your reflexes and keep you thinking fast But there never seemed to be any hard science to back it up Over 20 years later Nintendo s releasing a product for the Nintendo DS that is squarely aimed at that hard science making the claim that playing Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day can make your brain feel fresh and sharp Well we re not scientists so we can t necessarily prove or disprove that claim but as a budget priced game Brain Age is strangely compelling even though its very nature is brutally repetitive The touch screen and DS microphone make the whole game possible It s a really slick way to play the game but it s also reliant on your handwriting and ability to speak clearly When you re rushing through math problems it s easy to squiggle down something that the game will misinterpret This is extremely frustrating as you re penalized for mistakes The voice recognition doesn t come into play very often and you can bypass it entirely if you like but we had trouble getting it to recognize certain words Over time you figure out exactly how the game wants you to write and speak and then adapt to it For the most part though the recognition is pretty impressive especially considering there s no calibration process involved OVERALL This game isnt really one of those games you look foward to do when you get home from whatever you do it s one of those games you can look foward to bring to do something thats why it s a usfull game made on a portabal system Great game for the roadtrip 
Innovative This is latest DS game I have purchased and somehow it happens to be educational AND fun It gives you fifteen different training tasks and sudoku to boost your Brain Age 20 years being best and 80 worst They re all preaty neat in that they all use the touch screen or MIC The only problem is that sometimes the writing and voice recognition of numbers and words isn t so great Besides that the games like the math facts and sudoku are VERY addictive So I recommend this for the cheap price 15 and addictiveness which is well worth it 
Loads of Fun I am having a great time playing this game I play it almost all day I like the fact you get to choose your own people to play I get to arrange the different people to my best estimate of a challenging game 
icewind dale 2 review very good game a classic dungeon crawl that captures essence of dnd game on compute 
Standard Fare If you like these games you ll love this one if you don t you won t 
The Godfather name alone could make this sell Simple Movie tie ins are usually a rather tiresome affair They sell bundles of units and are more often than not a large pile of mediocrity The Godfather game is different Obviously it s been made on the back of the unparalleled success of Francis Ford Coppolla s gangster masterpiece And it will sell for this reason as well However The Godfather game has it s own place in the epic narrative It would have been easy for EA to put the player in the shoes of Michael Corleone the main protagonist in the movies Indeed it may have been due to the failure in securing a license to use Al Pacino s voice and likeness that forced EA s hand in creating a fresh perspective on the famous storyline What we re left with is a new take featuring your good self a narrative that sees you seamlessly weave in and out of events loyal to the film For example when Luca Brasi is stabbed through the hand and garrotted at the start of the first movie you look in on the event through a window you re spotted and the scene turns into a revenge mission It s expertly executed as you feel a part of a story that is genuine and loyal to film The violence has been superbly recreated also The realistic nature of the firearms in The Godfather makes for interesting gameplay As you might be used to the rather cartoonish gunplay of Saint s Row and GTA The Godfather might at first seem unforgiving And it is But it s realistic take one bullet from close range and you re sleeping with the fishes it s as simple as that Conversely your own guns carry the same clout so shootouts often become intense and challenging affairs if a little frustrating Where as in GTA s gun fighting success is dependent on how quickly you can change targets and get your shots off The Godfather sees you picking your shots and timing runs between cover It s obvious that EA s development focussed heavily on the walking and shooting parts of the game as this is where most of the appeal lies Driving however is a different affair altogether Given the nature of The Godfather EA were limited on what is and isn t possible for the driving sections The physics of the cars mean they are frustrating to play with Most of the vehicles are slow and the faster cars seem unnaturally quick The handbrake turns that work so well in GTA are irritatingly difficult to pull off especially when being chased by the coppers Cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected Other vehicles however are seemingly made of concrete Also getting from one way point to another can be at times be tedious GTA gets round this by the superbly scripted radio stations but The Godfather doesn t have such ingenuity you re instead treated to a violin based soundtrack that is depressing once the novelty has done a runner The valid excuse is that most of this isn t EA s fault this is more or less what it was like to drive a car in them days There was no radio the cars were lame classic but moved like pair of concrete boots Where the violence is so real so must the rest of the game be if only for consistency As you would expect much of what you do is directed by the storyline However there have been provisions for those who are more impulsive Outside of the missions there are businesses to extort and rackets to take over Doing as such will build your weekly wage which you can then in turn spend on clobber and sorting your hair out You have a respect bar that increases with each completed mission but coolly this isn t the only way to gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters Buying a nice wise guy suit brings in the plaudits and boosts the respect meter as much as whacking a guy Each time your character levels up you get a point to allocate to his attributes It s a bit of a weak RPG element but worth thinking about when acquiring garments Extorting businesses is tricky but worth the effort You ll usually have to take out two or three bad guys before being able to get to the owner When you do the situation requires thought Essentially you need to scare the businessman into paying and you do so by finding his or her limit So while some owners will agree to protection as soon as you ask others will have to be battered to the brink of death Pretty sick but then the life of a gangster isn t for fairies Be warned though going over the top or killing the proprietor will render the business inactive for a while and you ll get nothing but a bruised set of knuckles It s a fantastic sidetrack to the main game that has to be taken seriously if you want to hire muscle and buy more powerful weapons for later missions And so you ve got two sections of the same game that sit paradoxically to each other The superbly well balanced combat game play that forces you to be thoughtful and timely And the very dodgy vehicle part that frustrates and bores more than anything else It s difficult to review a sandbox game without making a comparison to GTA although it s slightly unfair to do so with The Godfather given the rules imposed by the subject matter At it s very best it delivers a gritty realism but by the same realistic token it can be at times terribly dull It is difficult to dislike The Godfather as EA have been so faithful to everything we loved about the films but this is the undoing of the game also It would have been forgivable to exaggerate the gameplay in places in order to make it more entertaining But The Godfather is a game for the purists and in order to please it has to feel genuine The Godfather certainly is 
I m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse That s exactly what this game says to me I just couldn t refuse That s for 2 reasons I love the movies and the game is NASTY What a f in game man AWESOME I like it better than the GTA games and Scarface Maybe it s cause I m such a fan of the movie Maybe it s cause I m Sicilian But I love this game I haven t been glued to the TV like this since Devil May Cry 3 The controls are great Fighting and shooting are spectacular Easy to get a hold on The voice overs make it RIDICULOUS to listen to and watch especially in the cinema scenes Marlon Brando James Caan Robert Duvall The only thing is WHERE S AL PACINO I would have SWORN he d be in it Michael Corleone is nothing like MICHAEL CORLEONE That s my only real complaint WHY WHY WHY isn t he in here Anyway back to the pros The virtual New York City here is great The cars driving around the people walking the streets having conversation The fact that you can rob banks and trucks is sick Then there s the EXTORTION WOW I love running around extorting businesses I love the fact that you can do things however you like Talk to someone man to man or woman Smash up their shop Smack the owner around a little bit It s fun as hell The mob face is awesome I really think my character looks like me The guns are crazy ESPECIALLY the upgrades I got my guns all leveled up and they are RIDICULOUS The way you create your own character and you play a part in the storyline is fantastic It s taken me 40 hours to become Don of NYC and finish the game The only thing I have left to do now is find the rest of the film reels But basically it s taken my 40 hours to beat the game What the hell I ll start from the beginning again 
you talkin to me This game is great Both the missions and the things you do on your own like extortion make this game an awesome part of anyone s collection I only found one thing wrong with the game When you reach the rank of Don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel For instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble This game although great can still use a little fine tuning 
The Corleone Family wants to buy YOU out This game reminds me alot of the Grand Theft Auto series While it has many similar characteristics in the way you get around town go into buildings and the way you interact with the environment it still manages to offer a few original and interesting components to the gaming industry This game has a great storyline that fans will likely enjoy Even if you weren t a fan of the movie this game is still a must Like GTA there are a few side missions not as massive as GTA though there are collectibles and then you have main missions along the way While the object of the game is to take over New York some of the warehouses and businesses can get repetitive but its mostly all fun One plus is the police in this game tend to be less of a hassle unlike the GTA games This lets you keep playing rather than having to stop and restart at a safehouse or in the police station This helps speed up the game The controlls take time to get used to but after you play for a little while you are good to go If you like the GTA format style of play you will certainly like this Also if you like the Godfather the storyline to the game is great and really stays true to the movie While its not the best game of the year it will certainly do until a new GTA comes out It took me about 2 weeks to finish the game playing a few hourse each night I hope they can come up with Godfather 2 We will see 
If you don t like this game you can sleep with the fishes This game is one of EA s best efforts outside of the sports genre in recent years It feels a little like Grand Theft Auto but also has the easy to use format that is common to EA games While it is violent there are no rewards for killing pedestrians and doing so creates a hassel for your character In true mob form you can bribe police officers but killing them isn t usually the best alternative The weapon system in this game is great You can start out by buying or picking up basic weapons at the beginning and can purchase more efficient and accurate weapons later in the game The old stand by s of shotguns tommyguns pistols dynamite and even bombs are all available for purchase If you are a into character development this is the sandbox game for you It allows you to gain experience respect that you can use to upgrade any of 10 different skills If you are a fan of the classic movie you probably won t be dissappointed either While the game takes place parallel to the action of the film it is fairly well done and even though Micheal looks nothing like Pachino the other major characters all show up James Cann plays Sonny with gusto and makes the cutscenes pretty entertaining The customization is great too for those tired of playing as one of the GTA characters that you are forced to be in those games You can change appearence clothing and body type among other things The gameplay is solid and the shooting system is far more rewarding than most third person shooters The game took me 25 hours to beat on the medium difficulty and another 10 to get all of the unlockables Trust me this is a great game with pretty good replay value 
When you re old enough and the time is right you will take your revenge You know it s been quite some time since I ve found myself glued to a videogame where in my mind hours become seconds I say to myself that I m only going to play for a few minutes fifteen tops next thing you know three hours have gone by The last game to do that to me was GTA San Andreas I thought there would never be another game that would hook me like that I was wrong Boy was I ever wrong The Godfather for PS2 is an addicting and gripping game that throws you into the world of the Mafia and links you to the classic storyline found in the film You play an older son with a score to settle Your father was wiped out by Don Barzini right in front of you when you were little Don Corleone tells you that when you re old enough you will take your revenge Now all grown up you aim to serve your Godfather and move up the ranks from an outsider to becoming a made man and then some If you re clever enough you might even become Don If you re ruthless enough to wipe out all of your enemies you can become the Don of NY The decision is up to you The game gives you the classic storyline that we all love and know from the movie only it involves you The missions will be very familiar to the famous scenes we have seen over and over again Not only that but in GTA fashion you are given a lot of freedom to do things on your own You can shake down rival businesses using various negotiation tactics Need some extra cash Rob a bank Better yet hijack a rival truck and steal the goodies inside You re given a giant world to interact with Whether you decide to play the missions straight through or do some freelancing many opportunities to enjoy the game are to be had The graphics are pretty impressive Players who are familiar with the GTA games will have an easier time getting used to the controls and the various camera angles The look and feel are very identical If you want my honest opinion I actually enjoy this game a lot more than any of the GTA games but that s because I m such a fan of the movie It s great that you get to relive your favorite scenes and be a part of the action Cons The missions can be tricky and sometimes even downright frustrating A good majority of them are timed so it may take you a few times to get a mission done just right I understand the timer in some missions but sometimes they get a little ridiculous and I feel that they re just trying to throw some unneeded obsticles in your path The good news is that there are tons of checkpoints for each mission so if you fail or die you will not have to start all over again Also the game can be glitchy at times Now I haven t seen anything major that disrupts my playing at all but I ve heard some people with earlier copies that had some major problems so be careful about that I could go on and on about this game but I m sure it s all been said before You want my verdict I love this game and think it s a blast to play The Godfather is bound to be a classic If you re a fan of the movie or the GTA games then give it a shot I have beat the game twice already and I still find myself playing it all over again more and more If you have no free time whatsoever then stay away This game will consume you whether you like it or not You have been warned The offer has been made Don t you dare try to refuse it if you know what s good for you Michael Cran 
Ver 2 0 is fun but serious modders beware FYI If you enjoy modding to spice up your GTA world and enhance replayability you DO NOT WANT TO BUY VER 2 0 Due to lawsuits over the hot coffee mod ver 2 0 was released with new code that prevents any mods from working If you want to replace the Banshee with the new Ferrari Superamerica or the Landstalker with an H2 you need ver 1 0 If you don t care about modding then sit back and enjoy the ride 
Square should be ashamed when I heard that Square was putting out a game and Disney was fronting it I was on even keel I don t have much love for disney but that rings true for mario as well and I still played Mario RPG However unlike Mario RPG from here on just Mario Final Fantasy FF characters weren t featured I m all for a little cosmetic upgrade on Squall and Cloud since the graphics of when the their games were made and now have quite a gap One thing I didn t expect is that some of the most powerful and beloved characters in video game history would take back seat to a kid with a key for a weapon These two protagnosits in particular had much more emotional development and struggle then Sora ever will This is beyond frusterating After all Cloud has been through he is still seen as this weak willed person with no direction or purpose in life Squall on the other hand unlike Cloud s psychological battle had huge distancing and emotional issues to overcome especially abandonment But in FF8 he showed that final boss and Greiver what for To know that I put so much time in 2 games that gave me a reason to truly care about all 8 members in either given game I couldn t care less about Sora and his friends or the fate of every Disney world Lame Square Lame You have some of the most highest grossing games in both RPG and over all in history and you still sold out for DISNEY I had come to expect more from a company that caused me to stay up so many nights miss so much homework and miss out on so many life experiences Thank GOD you didn t disgrace some of your more advanced titles Xenogears and Vagrant Story come to mind Well thats my review and any true square fan can take it or leave it but while you play your game just remember who your dishonoring 
This game just plain rocks This game is just so intresting game to play Loving the disney characters and a fanatic for the final fantasy series especially FF7 Seeing Cloud in this game was SOOOOOOO Cool Playing as Sora You travel through the worlds of Disney Characters Sure the fighting may have gotten a little annoying but you quickly forget about it once you are on your way to the new world you are about go to Overall the graphics were SWEET storyline even better and the voices along with the intresting atmosphere really made this a great game that should be all gaming collections Highly recommended 
good game it is very confusing and I had to find some hints for playing the game too much going back and forth hunting for things and if you miss something you sometimes can t go back to get it Overall I like it because it is not overly difficult so far I hate games that are so difficult that only experienced gamers can play 
One of the best games i ve ever played Life seems perfect for young boy Sora voiced by Haley Joel Osmont with his buddies Kairi and Riku on his island but when a freak storm mysteriously takes them away things go out of hand The same weird thing has happened in the imaginary disney kingdom where King Mickey Mouse has mysteriously vanished without a trace with only Donald and Goofy on a mission to find him Along the way they meet Sora and team up with him to travel to different worlds based on each disney movie like Aladdin Little Mermaid Hercules Tarzan Beauty and The Beast The Nightmare Before Christmas and more as they battle the evil heartless and such bad guys like Ursula Jafar Hades and more One of the most ingenius and unique video games i ve ever played successfully combines disney with Final Fantasy to create one incredible game that will blow your mind Fans of both Disney and FF will rejoice as this game puts together both things the graphics are spectacular especially the music score The controlling is good once you get use to it and you ll hear the voices of Billy Zane James Woods Tony Goldwyn Sean Astin Jodie Benson Robbie Benson Chris Surandon and Gilbert Godfried here this is one hell of a game you must have if you love RPG and disney with FF alike Get it today including it s even better sequel 
Exellent Game This is a no spoiler review This game takes place on a group of islands twenty years after the events of Chrono Trigger This game also takes place between two parallal worlds hence the name Chrono CROSS In this game you have the ability to recruit up to 44 characters To get all of them you will need to play through the game at least 3 times You will probably WANT to play the game more times anyway depending on how long it takes you understand the story line considering it is VERY complex I wouldn t recommend this game to someone who doesn t like RPG s or long games It took me at least 50+ hours to get through the game the first time and that was with the guide book If you plan on getting this game I would also suggest the guide book for it as well Because there are somethings you would not find for the life of you unless you had something telling where to go and what to do For example some of the characters 7th level tech skills are impossible to find and get without the book You can find the Chrono Cross Guide on Amazon as well but beware it usually isn t cheap If you liked any of the Final Fantasy games you would probably like this game as well Something else to keep in mind is that the battle system is somewhat different that any other game you don t use MP you use what are called elements These take the place of magical attacks There is a down side to the elements though when you wish to change characters you must remove all the elements you had on that character so you can place them on another character This can be VERY TIME CONSUMING especially later in the game when you have lots of element slots to fill Beware you WILL HAVE to do this a lot But don t let that get you down This is an exellant game despite all that With all that being said I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan Hope this review helps 
Good game does it only work for PS1 When this game first came out i bought it I was very into the game Back then thats when there was just a ps1 But i never finished the game My original game was all scratched up so i bought a new one Now having just a ps2 I got the game but my ps2 seems not to read the disc I dont know why Does it only work for people who still have their ps1 I thought ps2 s were suppose to read ps1 games as well The thing is also My brother bought the game too and it still didnt read it in my ps2 So any help would be appreciated cause i want to play this again Thanks 
Truly amazing role playing game Chrono Cross which is a semi sequel to 1995 s Chrono Trigger cant even come close to its former games plateua Chrono Trigger is arguably the greatest RPG ever created So while Chrono Cross is not as good it still does a whole heck of a lot of things right The gameplay story and battles in this game are all top notch Its fun to get a handle over the numerous tough boss battles in this game because of the elemental magics strategic system Black beats white and red beats blue etc Its always fun and interesting to see what the next dungeon or boss has to offer The gameplay is never sluggish and will always keep you on your toes Also when you beat the game you have an option to replay the entire game again with all of your beefed up characters from before And if things are going slow you can speed them up with a fast forward button on your second play through the game Truly brilliant So why does this game get 4 out of 5 if it is so darn good Because of its confusing tedious magic system and over abundance of characters Most of the magics and summons in this game are a joy to watch and to behold their might But in this game there are no magic points and you must equip every single magic spell you have That could mean 50+ spells to equip per character Setting up each character late in the game can take upwards of 5 10 minutes easily And each spell can only be cast once per battle unless you buy multiples of that spell And probably the games worst point is its ridiculous amount of characters Chrono Trigger had something like 7 recruitable characters that you can play as each with their own terrific and unforgettable personalities Chrono Cross has 44 recruitable characters 95 of your 40+ characters have the personality of a wood stool Some characters will literally say Can i join your party than join and NEVER say anything else EVER again Having 44 playable characters instead of 7 spreads each one way too thin and makes them all lose individuality In the end this game is still one of the greatest rpgs ever made for the first Playstation While its few flaws keep it from being a true classic it is still one of the greatest rpg experiences to be had in the past 5 years 
Possibly the best kart game ever It was inevitable that mario kart would finally make its way onto the DS The question that was on everybody s mind was is it going to be fun We can answer that question with an unequivocal YES AND A BAG OF CHIPS While it is not as pretty and intuitive as its big brother Mario Kart Double Dash on the GC it makes up for that tiny flaw with moxie and great design There are great new weapons at your disposal as well as more than a few familiar ones The single greatest weapon addition would have to be the ink bullet that temporarily blinds the driving screen forcing the gamer to navigate using the map on the upper screen And of course the new game brings in a new design feature that allows you to speed up if you tailgate your opponent for long enough allowing you zip past the competition But the single greatest design aspect of Mario Kart DS that makes it a contender for greatest kart game ever is summarized by two simple words Wireless Gameplay Now you can battle people as far as the other side of the world provided that you have useable WiFi in your area and if you don t you can easily remedy this by buying the Nintendo Wireless dongle that attaches to your USB port on your PC for blissful online gameplay I have had my buttocks handed to me on numerous occasions by players from Japan Mali and even in the good ole US of A as well as narrowly squeeking by with undeserved victories Player skills range from relatively new to god like mostly the japanese players so you might want to brush up on your skills before entering the online arena but rest assured that once you get into it you ll fall hard So to summarize Mario Kart DS good so you should buy Seriously Click on the buy now button right now You won t regret it 
mario kart ds my daughter age 8 love the game after school and when we go out in the car she is playing it 
A home run by Nintendo This game is another must own if you have a DS It has a total of eight cups with four races each 16 all new 16 retro Go through different difficulties to unlock new racers and Karts and mirror mode where you do the game backwards Also the first with WIFI gaming playing online is awesome In short BUY THIS GAME 
Shrek is Back Pretty Fun Lots of action and all the characters are here Some parts would be difficult for younger players or for single players though 
YOU GOTTA LOVE SHREK 2 IT S A MUST This game is really great I would recommend this game to anyone It s a great game to play with the family or by yourself I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times The first time i ve finished it it was kinda challenging on the last level but when I went over it again I zipped right threw it This game doesn t get you bored at all you ll be into it right from the beginning of the game I like how you can choose whoever you want during the game The graphics well they aren t as great as the movie But overall it s awesome I will play it over and over again It s great 
Enternaining This game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious You will need a lot of patience to play it 
Perfect fun for the younger set Shrek 2 was an amazingly funny movie with all of the wit and graphic animation of the first The game Shrek 2 is obviously geared towards kids but is great fun too The game lets you be one of four characters Shrek Fiona Donkey and the Gingerbread Man Each character has his or her strengths and weaknesses and the graphics are rather nicely done Shrek lands with a hard THUD Fiona floats gently to the ground and so on You can play multi player or solo easily switching between characters if you wish This is great for family play where parents can hop in to help out with a difficult puzzle or just wander along behind the child to be there in case of trouble Most of the game is about collecting items and solving simple puzzles You slam on snails to get them out of their shells and get eyeballs You slow down time so you can gather up the fairies All along there are fun jokes and riddles to keep you entertained Not all games have to be high brainpower puzzles or super fast lightning reflex challenges Sometimes it s nice to have a simple game that kids can really enjoy I m really pleased that this game is out there Highly recommended for the younger set and parents might actually enjoy playing along with the tykes 
fun but short The Incredibles movie was a pleasant suprise featuring lifelike characters well animated fight scenes and an interesting story The game follows closely to the movie with a few additional easter eggs First the good The Incredibles game has fun gameplay good overall graphics multiple cut scenes and a nice ammount of replayability The only problems with the game are that first the game is very short There aren t many levels and they aren t very long A good player can beat the entire game in less than a day but it will probably take a new player around a week Most of the length is caused by some hard sections such as the first two Omnidroid battles and places where the game makers didn t make it easy to grab a rope or something The game is heavily scripted making it easy to predict what you will have to face next The final problem is that you barely spend any time playing as Dash or Voilet Dash has two levels and Voilet only has one The game has a very fun bonus feature you can unlock about halfway through the game called Battle In battle you choose either Mr or Mrs Incredible and battle seemingly endless waves of enemies All in all The Incredibles is a short fun game that is worth a rental but you should think about it before you buy it Thanks for reading bubba samus 
The Incredibles game is cooool I have the Incredibles Game Cube game and it is cool and FUN Even if you get stuck at a part it is fun trying to figure it out This game is challenging but it is still fun unlike some games where you get really mad if you can t figure out a part This game is great 
Great for kids all of us that never grew up The original Lego Star Wars was a great little lighthearted romp of a game an amusing way to play out the three most recent Star Wars films in virtual form The Lego and Star Wars combo proved to also be a terrific formula for the game space generating an experience in Lego Star Wars that was oftentimes even more entertaining than the source material it was based on Like any good sequel Lego Star Wars II improves on the original in almost every way But most importantly it s about the good episodes now For that reason alone Lego Star Wars II is one of the most enjoyable games of this fall Featuring the story lines and characters of A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi it s hard to believe that any Star Wars fan which is what pretty much everyone wouldn t love this game While the gameplay is pretty standard action fare for the most part it s somehow made so much more fun because of the Lego characters Levels that could perhaps be dismissed as lackluster in other games absolutely work here Star Wars scenes are comically recreated and look and sound great though to nitpick some of the John Williams music samples don t play in their entirety making you wish for more But make no mistake even those without a predilection for Star Wars will enjoy this it s the combination of great story lines characters and comedic elements provided by Lego that makes it all work The game s designers clearly had fun with it all you ll be continuously entertained by how they incorporated elements of the film into the gameplay often taking some rather humorous liberties along the way The Lego brand clearly afforded them freedom to have fun with the Star Wars license While most of the gameplay consists of run and gun action there are lots of puzzles to be found many of which are quite good even though some have rather unclear objectives and several missions that take place in vehicles from AT ST Walkers to X wings While the vehicular stages vary in terms of quality the mere fact that so many exist really adds to the scope of the game Lego Star Wars II offers a surprising amount of playtime and is much larger and longer than the original game which was one of its biggest criticisms Once again you control a group of characters that pertain to a scene allowing you to easily switch between them on the fly in order to take advantage of their unique abilities Unfortunately though your A I controlled buddies are kind of clueless at times and offer little support in battles while they do fire it s all for show their shots inflict no damage on enemies The game s far better when a second player joins in to play a game can be joined at any time it s loads of fun as a co op experience It s just a shame that Lego Star Wars II offers no online support What s also neat about the game is that there s a lot to do outside of the standard mission structure There are lots of collectables to gather secret items to discover and hidden areas to unlock certain areas aren t immediately accessible on the first playthrough only on return using other characters can they opened The option to build your own custom characters with parts taken from others such as a C 3PO equipped with a Darth Vadar head is amusing as well There s definitely a lot of fun to be had with Lego Star Wars II making it a good choice for those looking for a solid action platformer it s an ideal choice for those fans of Star Wars It s also perfect for almost all ages offering a rewarding experience even for younger players All of the many versions Xbox 360 PS2 PC Xbox GameCube and PSP look essentially the same with the PC version offering better resolutions and the Xbox 360 version more visual effects though it s unfortunately priced 10 more than the others Rumor has it that developers Traveller s Tales have more Lego games in the works after this including one based on Batman here s hoping as this formula simply works 
Great Gaming Fun for all ages I loved the original Lego Star Wars game It was incredibly fun very replayable and had a wicked sense of humor Lego Star Wars II is just as fun and covers Episodes IV VI It s very rare to find a game that kids can play adults can play and everybody truly loves it This is one of those games I m sure kids enjoy the game quite a lot but pretty much every adult gamer I know loves this series as well It s fun it has classic scenes from the Star Wars movies done in a VERY funny style and you can keep replaying it You can play it with friends You can unlock new episodes new ships new characters you name it The first thing you notice when you enter the Cantina is that now you can MAKE NEW CHARACTERS Yes you can mix up Darth Vader s head Princess Leia s torso and a stormtrooper s pants You can mix pretty much any character you find in the game and give them personalized names Then you can bring 2 of your creations into the game with you on free play mode Talk about fun The game gets even better Yes you work through all the classic scenes Luke buying the droids the Death Star blowing up and so on from the first 3 movies in release order at least The cut scenes are VERY funny Being able to play along as the various characters is amazingly fun in story mode and even better in free play when you can randomly switch between a variety of characters to find all the hidden items I love the stud finding system You want more money Just replay a mission a few times You can get all sorts of fun cheats not cheats really but fun add ons you can buy new characters to use and much more It really gives you incentive to keep playing Is a youngster in the house having trouble playing Just have an adult pop into the game for a while to help out then the adult can pop out again to let the child keep playing It is just brilliant I love this game The graphics are superb as last time with little lego movements seeming just right Their swaggers and sliders are incredibly funny The sound of course is the real movie soundtrack and is superb You couldn t ask for anything better Even the tiny touches are funny If C 3PO starts getting hit he loses an arm then another arm then a leg You have him hopping along valiantly behind you trying to remain with your team Chewie rips off arms from stormtroopers Now of course there are always a few things the game designers get wrong While Chewie s arm ripping is quite funny it is REALLY annoying when he does it very slowly in the middle of a firefight when you wanted him to be blasting away The characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone is nearby even if you really needed to fire away at someone with the blaster Even more annoying if you re blasting away at destructables wall items whatever and your friend gets near you start bashing on him The camera is also really annoying You get a slight amount of view control but not much When you are craning around trying to find a mini kit on the screen and the camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you do NOT want to look it can get very frustrating Still these are minor problems in a game that is so stellar I highly highly recommend this game for any gamer of any age It s incredibly fun 
The Force is Strong With This One After the release of Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith in theaters we got Lego Star Wars a game that was a lot of fun to play simply because it emulated the movies rather well with all the characters being made entirely from Legos Lego Star Wars II The Original Trilogy is even better for the simple fact of nostalgia Any Star Wars fan will enjoy this You ll begin the game in the Cantina in Mos Eisley This is the hub and from there you can go into any of the three episodes and play through them At the start you ll only be able to choose A New Hope but after completing the first chapter you can choose The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi As you go through the three episodes you ll some of the most memorable moments of the movies acted out entirely with legos These moments aren t only memorable but they re given a hilarious charm These moments are also from the actual original versions of the movies as well In other words Han Solo DOES shoot first The game is visually striking Seeing your favorite characters from the original Star Wars films as legos is quite a treat Not only do you get to have nostalgia with Star Wars but with legos as well Even better are the hilarious antics of most of the scenes To benefit the nostalgia even more is how John Williams classic score accompanies each and every level of the game For a Star Wars fan this game is the ultimate nostalgia As you play through each of the classic episodes you ll be in control of several characters Not all at once but you ll end up having to switch At times you may only have two characters at others there may be as many as seven in your party at once Your characters depending on who they are also have their own unique skills they can use Jedi for example can double jump and use the force Those who wield blasters have a grappling hook that allows them to ascend to accessible platforms The droids can open up special doors for you Other characters like the Jawas and Ewoks will be able to go into vents and access areas the other characters can t In all actuality they re really no different than their counterparts in the original Lego Star Wars Also like the original Lego Star Wars you ll constantly have to switch between characters in order to get through each and every area You ll have to switch to R2 D2 to open up a door for example More than one person can play at a time which is also really cool You can also beat up your allies if you wish and they respawn instantly The gameplay isn t completely the same though there have been some small tweaks made here and there The additions to the gameplay aren t huge but they are welcome As you progress through levels all your characters may be able to assemble certain materials together to form a droid to help them fight In the original Lego Star Wars this ability was only given to the Jedi but here everyone can do it There are also moments when you ll have to dress up as a stormtrooper in order to gain access through certain doors You ll also be given the chance at some point to dress up as a bounty hunter and you ll be able to use Thermal Detonators Characters also have their own unique abilities Chewie for example can rip a stormtroopers arms right out of his sockets All of these are welcome additions and that s not even all there is to the gameplay From time to time you ll be in command of vehicles Landspeeders the Millennium Falcon the X Wing and more as you take on some of the more memorable moments from the film like destroying the death star It will probably only take you five hours at the very least to complete the story mode of all three episodes However Lego Star Wars II is full of extras Each time you dispatch an enemy whether it be in story mode or not you ll earn money You can also destroy certain objects and obtain money You can use the money you gain to purchase cheats and hidden characters Each time you get a new character they ll walk around in the hub and you can switch to them Purchasing characters isn t the only way to get them You could easily just use one in story mode and you ve got him or her You ll also get hidden characters if you ve got save data from the original Lego Star Wars Just unlocking all the characters takes a lot of time The importance of unlocking characters is so you can play through certain aspects of the free play mode There are places that in story mode the default characters couldn t reach These hidden characters might be able to reach it though and so you will find yourself playing through levels again The good news is these levels are so much fun that playing through a second third or even fourth time is no hassle at all Free mode also offers a way for you to customize what a character looks like You could put Yoda s head on Luke Skywalker s body for example This is mostly just a lot of fun to mess around with Some combinations are just all out crazy You could for example put Chewbacca s head on Leia s body from when she s wearing the slave outfit in Return of the Jedi This really doesn t do a whole lot for the gameplay as a whole but it is quite fun to mess around with and the combinations are endless The only real problem with this game that I can really think of is that there is little if any challenge at all Each time you die you respawn right where you left off and you have infinite lives There s really no such thing as a game over If you die the only penalty is that you lose money However the sheer fun factor of the game is enough to do away with that and still makes Lego Star Wars II a treat Lego Star Wars II surpasses the original in just about everyway It s a Star Wars game for the classic trilogy done with instant perfection If you love the original Star Wars movies you ll definitely want this game On the positive side +Based off the original theatrical versions and not the special editions +Beautiful game +Addictive gameplay +Co op mode +Several extras and hidden characters +Customizable characters +Tons of replay value On the negative side The story mode is quite short While not really much of a con for this game it s got very little challeng

Nintendo releases pink to further please your mom your girlfriend or girls in general Im quite sure that your mom probally has her eye on the DS especially with the release of the DS Lite and games like Brain Age that your mother would want But I am also sure that your mom may not like the White color well that s good becausse The Coral pink DS will make it more fashionable for girls as well as maybe even attract a few guys as well no I am not gay steorotypical or homophobic I say to the people who first bashed the DS this is what you get for talking crap It might be astonishing that Sony is getting their butts kicked after all PS2 destroyed the Gamecube in terms of sales same thing with PS and N64 but some people just don t get the PSP That s fine but I like my PSP better basically because my favorite genre is racing And DS dosen t have Lumines or GTA or Locoroco and so on and so on But then again the DS has Mario Magnetica whatever It all depends on what you like best for most but since I am no fanboy or like videogames from all the far reaches of the galaxy I enjoy each and every system Now for the system YOu know you do not want to be bored with the tedious details and how everythng is better and all the other stuff you basically don t need but this system is ideal even for the people who have original DS s If you like the DS this system update is actuallly worth it The Stylus is way bigger it s certainly looks better it s easier to play better design and better system in general Sure you could say that you don t need it but that s fine Although for some people especially the Nintedno fans they just can t live without it and would definitly take it Myself included I got one very soon and also I give props to NIntendo for making sure enough was there to go around to everybody I have the White one but it s still the same great system although you would probally choose which color you want In short don t feel guilty if you shell out another 100 bucks it s really worth it If you don t have it it s worth it as you can get all kinds of cool stuff this fall and that includes a web browser So far though Europe is gett ing it before us 
Nintendo DS Not just fun for kids I purchased a Nintendo DS in the pink color a couple of weeks ago Because I travel several times a year I needed something that could entertain me during long plane trips About a year ago I purchased a Gameboy Advance but I didn t like the graphics The screen was too small and it was difficult to see what was going on Needless to say I sold it a few weeks after I was still interested in buying a portable game system however and didn t know whether to purchase a DS or a PSP The PSP cost quite a bit more but it also allows you to play movies on it I ended up going with the DS because the store where I bought it only had demos for the DS not the PSP The Nintendo DS has good graphics at least far better than the GBA One thing you must look at when deciding which portable game system is best for you is the selection of games The majority of Nintendo DS games are for kids However there are several games that adults can play that will tickle your brain I tend to go for the puzzle games but a few of the kid games are fun as well What I also like about the DS is that you don t have to press down too hard on the screen using the stylus You can purchase screen protectors for your DS but unless you re pressing down much harder than you should you won t need these Also you can store the stylus on the bottom of your system The box contains extra stylii in case you lose one but the handy storage compartment should prevent this from happening You don t have to charge the system too often Usually one charge lasts several hours However whenever I m playing at home I always plug in the adapter Also there s a headphone jack in case you don t want to annoy other people with the audio from the game you re playing Headphones don t come with the system so you have to buy them seperately I bought the DS Starter pack which comes with special DS headphones As far as portable game systems go I suggest purchasing the DS They re perfect for any age preschool age to adult and the price isn t too up there 
Prettier In Pink Nintendo hasmaintained their status as one of the most successful video game companies ever Since they hit it big back in the 80 s they ve maintained to be as synonomous with the way we play video games just as Microsoft has IBM has maintained the computers A couple of years ago Nintendo revolutionary changed the way we play video games with the DS handheld system Not only has it worked very well but it has changed the way we played video games with the touch of a pen Earlier this year the company redesigned the system with the DS Lite Now it has been remade and it is pretty in pink The Nintendo DS Lite in Coral Pink is a video game system not only designed for the hard core gamer but the color makes it have a femanine touch for female gamers too from its detailed color to its elequent pink colored stylus The screen is very crisp and clear and deliver beautifully in its display The graphics are crisper and clearer than the original DS system on so many different titles from New Super Mario Brothers the action packed puzzler Meteos and new games like Star Fox Command and Mario Hoops 3 on 3 Not only that but if you re a fan of Game Boy Advance games you can play your GBA games on the system as well The gameplay is crisper and delivers the best control for the system but also a easier way to play games that original DS owners had trouble tackling All in all the Nintendo DS Lite is a great video game system because it is inexpensive and convient for the die hard gamer in not just the price but the games too I love this system a whole lot and if you have the desire to own a video game system I definitely recommend this one for everyone Graphics A Sound A Control A Fun Enjoyment A Price A Overall A 1 2 
The King of all Dragonball games This game is a masterpiece of the dragonball name the graphics are nice certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation that looks like they took it from the show itself they didn t really do that You have the option of just playing the fusion characters by doing fusion and you don t have any time limit at all or you can just select the character by itself this goes for transformations as well Giant Ape characters Super Sayian levels not 4 as they put Goku and Vegeta ss4 as seperate characters Some of the bad parts from the first game don t exist in this game some of the characters didn t have the best moves list for the first game like SS4 Goku which he had full power energy balls Super Explosive wave and for his ultimate the 10X Kamehameha Wave It was also nice to put some of the lesser known characters in the dragon ball universe to be in the game as well Garlic Jr Turles Slug Jenemba s first form Pikkon Pan Ubb etc However not every single character is in this game which makes it look horrible when you play the story mode the following characters are not in this game GT Goku little and his super sayian forms Dr Wheelo Worlds Strongest GT Trunks and SS GT Goten and SS GT Gohan and SS GT Vegeta and his SS forms Bio Broly maybe we re better off not having him in this because I m sure that he wasn t very popular anyway the 6 other dragons General Rildo early part of Baby saga when the gang was on M2 Goku JR Vegeta JR This game is half tenkaichi and 1 3 of each budokai games 1 Dragon Universe is back but much better 2 Some things have been exclusive to the game in the first Budokai Cell accidently swallows Krillin instead of 18 and made a little story of of that every sayian character who had armor and a tail like Raditz for instance can transorm into a Giant Ape 3 Like Budokai 2 when you first started Dragon World you had a selection of Goku Adult Gohan and so forth in the adventure mode of this game in some of the later chapters they used Ultimate Gohan as GT gohan and Trunks with sword to make it look like your playing GT Trunks This has to be one of the cheesist things ever in any game This was the most impressive game in the series and will be the last dragonball game to appear on PS2 as we are heading toward the next generation of consoles A Wii version is coming out too 
Unabashedly biased about this game First off as many people have said the game is wonderful as a movie less so as a game itself I am not a habitual player of RPGs for the sake of their gameplay however I stray toward puzzle solving and instant action games along the lines of the Ecco the Dolphin and Metroid series respectively but I appreciate the intricate storytelling the genre allows for Xenosaga really goes overboard for the sake of its story and there s nothing wrong with that The game is pretentious and open about being pretentious The cast of characters are all to a greater or lesser degree mentally ill from heroes to villains and back again The story takes a sudden and whiplash inducing turn in the last third of the game The morality of decisions made are distinctly Nietzschean which is to say often amoral and confused But the critical but it s a wonderful story often BECAUSE of these facts If you d like a good story to chew over and talk with your friends about I m still talking about it three years after I was introduced to it buy this game If you want instant action and a transparent storyline eh give it a try It can t hurt anything But understand when you re going into it that this is more of a movie than it is a game the objective is to entertain enlighten and even disturb through the visual medium not necessarily through the gameplay itself Oh and there s plenty of eyecandy for both the ladies and the gentlemen Always a bonus 8 
Awsome It s like a cross between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost In The Shell VERY COOL 
A very good RPG Unfortunately Xenosaga I Der Wille zur Macht is never come to Europe But as the second Xenosaga Jenseits von Gut und B se was released in Germany in November I was very happy So I played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay I became a big Xenosaga Fan After that I imported the first part of the series from America Now I am playing it and I must say that the first Xenosaga is much better than the second It s a great pity that Xenosaga Episode I never will be brought out in Germany and Europa You Americans should be very happy that so many RPGs come to your country ^_ 
Great but not for everyone This game is good It has an excellent story line great graphics and an innovative battle system but it is extremely difficult It took me months to beat it and I honestly can t recommend it There was too much involved in beating it to really make me say it was worth it 
Haven t seen it all yet I m enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when I received it I haven t had the chance to play as much as I d like but I will 
Two reasons to get this card There are only two reasons to get this Xbox Live subscription card First as a gift for someone who already has Xbox Live and wants to renew his subscription Second the normal yearly fee is 50 so if you can get this card cheaper than that you ll save money This card is not a good way to get Xbox Live if you don t already have it For that purpose buy the starter kit ASIN B000209V8K which includes a free game a headset and a year subscription Without the headset Xbox Live is pretty boring 
Great gift for the Christmas season Hey You probably know at least one person who plays games on XBox LIVE And what with the Christmas season coming up this could be the perfect gift for him or her XBox LIVE is an online community of gamers Friendships are often formed and who can blame them what with the ability to actually to talk to someone who is playing the same game as you You re instantly in a community filled with people who like this one game you like and their are so many games which use LIVE for other things such as free downloads updates for games If you have a cable connection and an XBox you can t afford to not have XBox LIVE So if you know someone who has XBox LIVE get them a gift that will last a year Trust me they will enjoy it 
Xbox Live the Best Internet Gaming Ever I know I know But I have been playing online since the days of text based MUDDs Most of you reading this are way too young to even know what a MUDD was but back in 1982 we were playing them Yes I said 1982 I ve been playing online games just that long and have seen the evolution of just about every type of online game and environment you can think of I ve played Battle net and Heat net and just about every other online gaming service free or subscription based that there has been to play over the last 20 years Many of you may not even know what Xcite means but they were responsible for online gaming on the 16 bit systems SEGA Genesis and Super Nintendo I had those too amp quot So after playing online for nigh 20 years I had to ask myself what on Earth is Xbox Live XBL going to do that is so much more better about it than any other online experience than I have ever had amp quot this is what I was thinking before I signed up and I was very skeptical and rightfully so But once I was on and was playing my tune changed rather quickly In all the years that I have been playing online there has simply been no single experience as fun exciting and solid as the XBL experience yes even the PS2 Online experience is inferior to XBL It is quite safe to say that they last 20+ years of online gaming have been ultimately leading up to XBL Microsoft has taken all the best attributes of online gaming and infused them into XBL while leaving all of the worst attrtributes on the cutting room floor And check this out they are constantly improving the experience While you have a XBL subscription all upgrades for the service are free of charge And we get upgrades and improvements every few months The XBL experience is so good that many in even the PC gaming communittee prefer XBL over PC online gaming and are clamouring to get XBL on the PC and later this year they will finally have it Then there is all the tons of free stuff that you can get on XBL I cannot remember just how many new levels and modes and maps and soundtracks of various XBL games that I have downloaded in the last year for absolutely free And with almost 100 games available to use the service and that number looking to more than double itself by the end of 2004 that s just even more opportunities to downlaod more free stuff to my Xbox harddrive Inconclusion XBL really is the best online gaming there has ever been to date However you do not have to take my word for it you can find out for yourself for absolutely free Most XBL games these days come with a 2 Month Trial Card FREE in the game s box Just use that to sign up for a temporary account and you get full access to all XBL services for FREE for two whole months That s two whole months full access to the best online gaming service ever created If by then you feel that this is not for you then you are FREE to cancel the service without further obligation YOU CANNOT LOSE Anyway I play XBL everyday and I hope to see some of you there soon 
CHRONIC MANUFACTURER S DEFECT Nintendo is aware of a manufacturer s defect that occurs with DS Lite and the regular DS game systems that come in colors not the silver one The plastic hinge closest to the power supply develops a stress crack that happens with simple everyday use Nintendo refuses to accept these cracks as defects and tries to attribute them to rough play We have owned 3 DS lites and all 3 have developed the same stress crack in the same spot all within 2 3 months of owning them The first one cracked enough to render the unit unplayable The same has happened to friends of ours While kids will be kids my kids certainly aren t playing touch football with their DSs There are dozens of websited dedicated to this problem just takes a little Googling some attribute it to overtightening during manufacturing Nintendo will not cover this repair under warranty but will be nice enough to reduce the 75 repair fee to 50 So when choosing a Nintendo DS Lite ask yourself if you want a brighter screen or a sturdier unit My 7 year old son who is on his 2nd DS Lite has just asked if he could have the original one for Christmas 
Excellent even for Brain Age Big Brain Academy only I purchased the Nintendo DS lite solely to use it with Brain Age and Big Brain Academy I have not used it to play other games and do not intend to do so I am still confident in giving it a 5 because keeping my brain active is worth it My wife also uses it daily Pros long battery life 8 12 hours is what I have seen easy to use compact possible use as internet browser if a card is purchased I have only seem them on e bay from Japan mixed reviews Con the biggest complaint is it does not utilize the built in WiFi by not coming with a built in internet browser not really interested in adding MP3 and JPG files but I would like to have the option to do so more educational games in line with Brain Age or Big Brain Academy Overall It is worth the 129 for the DS lite and 19 for Brain Age to start using your brain again 
DS Lite great fun Though I only have one game so far I found that the DS Lite was easy to start up and easy to get started on my game I cannot wait to buy another game for the DS Lite and try out other features 
Final Fantasy Chronicles This is one of the best games I have ever played Anyone who is sceptical just needs to pick a controller and go You won t be dissappointed 
Excellent package but serious flaws in code Both Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger are excellent games CT could be my favorite game of all time Final Fantasy IV has been excellently restored to its original hardtype version Story elements and dialog have been restored which is extremely exciting However I have a complaint about the port Somewhere in the port the code for saving a game was not optimized for the playstation but instead uses a version that works fine on solid state memory like a cartridge which these games were originally on but horribly when going from CD to solid state This is a serious flaw as saves can take up to half a minute to complete That is why this game gets 3 stars on overall 
Chrono Trigger This is a good deal You get FF4 which was final fantasy 2 back on the super nes and the great game Chrono Trigger A must have for rpg lovers Plus the art for Chrono Trigger is by the same artist of Dragonball and Dragon warrior VIII fame The games are long and Chrono Trigger can have many diffrent endings depending on the choices you make Overall It is a must 
Two epic RPG s in one package Two RPG masterpieces Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger have been re released in this great package with some nice additions I ll be reviewing the two games FINAL FANTASY IV INTRO In 1991 FFIV was originally released in America for the SNES under the name Final Fantasy II But the SNES version was pretty flawed For one thing they censored the script and and it was horribly translated Another thing is that they took out a few things such as the Developer s Room Also they toned down the difficulty Now the game has been re released for the PS1 with the complete uncut script Developer s Room and a harder difficulty GAMEPLAY This was the first FF game to have more than the number of characters in your party you can have up to five characters in your party Sweet The game has lots of secrets spells weapons and summons It s a really addicting RPG with a great challenge GRAPHICS Meh It was made in 1991 so of course the graphics look outdated But they were good for the time SOUND Not much to say about the sound It s your standard SNES sound MUSIC I love the music in this game Even 14 years later the music still packs a punch I especially love the boss music It s very catchy STORY This game has a great story I won t spoil it for you but the story is very original filled with plot twists ADDED EXTRAS Besides having the complete uncut game not much Just an FMV scene CHRONO TRIGGER INTRO Ten years ago CT was released for the SNES Even now it s still one of the most loved and popular RPG s ever Now it s been re released with a ton of extras GAMEPLAY CT is an RPG However there are things that are special about this game For one thing the battle system is unique You can use moves that combine different characters It s a bit hard to explain Another thing that makes this game unique is the fact that you can time travel You can alter the past and have fun Plus more eras mean more sidequests GRAPHICS Very ahead of its time CT s graphics were beautiful from the colorful 2D textures to the forests the graphics were topnotch MUSIC Like most RPG s CT has an epic musical score SOUND Pretty good for 1995 STORY The story I believe is solid It isn t the best RPG story ever but it is easy to understand and very entertaining REPLAY VALUE Most RPG s don t really have a replay value but this does Once you beat the game you can do a New Game+ which allows you to start the game over with everything you had on the first game Plus there are many and I mean MANY endings to unlock ADDED EXTRAS Awesome anime cutscenes and much more OVERALL Two epic RPG s in one package A must have 
Yes FF IV was the one with Sir Ceical the Dark Knight I played this game back in 91 when I was 21 watching 21 Jumpsteet Even the dumbed american version of this game was fun and at the time the only good form of entertainment better than 21 junkstreet with Jonny Dork and Hollie Ugglieson and that stupid werewolf show whatever lame coorprate PC bull show we Xr s had availible to watch back then Sir Ceicel the Black Knight turned prettyboy Paladin was the talk of the day back when even though it is knocked today Nintendo Power had nothing but good things to say about this game and Ceicilboy and of course you could change his name I only wish they would release this on GBA instead of a big consoles so I could play it in bed like the lazy I am FFIII is actually a title not released at all in America and instead a faked FFIII V II Altough I like Final Fantasy I got reinterested when I got the FF Dawn of Souls for the GBA thier is a lot of grandiosing such as space travel and modern stuff mixed in midevil settings that I think is inappropriate I think it should only be midevil and mystical as in FF1 and 2 Japanese 1 2 not US 1 2 Why does Cece Rosa and company have to go to the friggen moon cartoon Amimea is weird that way but I beveve some of the lameness is replaced with a better plot this time around in the Japanese version for PS I still rate it Five before and after except for the moon crap and the machines which may or may not be there this time around 
good It works just fine with your 360 it will reduce heat touch your 360 before and after using this device you will notice the difference a mus 
A turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there Its not perferct but its darn good The story if you can really call it that is that the world of Dominions once had one god One day he just wasn t there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job All of these pretender gods have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god To start up a new game of Dominions II you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars You can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary like the arch mage to the outrageously exotic like the fountain of blood Every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease You also pick a castle and set up your own dominion which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world But that isn t all you still haven t actually started a game yet Next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces And lets not forget you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or AI players The game itself is huge and has very few limits Your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to Plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions Like the pretender gods units come in a huge array from simple like the light infantry to the wild like werewoles and vampires Combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research hundreds of magic items to forge and find and random events almost every turn no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability Combat is a bit unsual All units in order to move around the map or attack have to be assigned to a commander Commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men However you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field The downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn Combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle Its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them For better or worse this system is certainly original But some things about the game really bother me My biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer AI Its not thats its too stupid or too smart Its actually a bit like the terminator it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you It can t be reasoned with it can t be bargined with and it won t stop until one of you is dead With no diplomacy options and units like spys assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the AI just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn Another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that isn t easily available in the game Its the same problem Evil Genius had the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens I hope you can read fast The grapics obviously aren t exactly on par with Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but they work however I ve got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright AWFUL You better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over Over all Dominions II is by far the best turn based fantasy game I ve ever played Room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time 
The most addictive game since Civilization This is truly an amazing game especially considering it s made by a small independent developer There s a virtually infinite number of different unit types spells and magic items so the game never gets repetitive and this is possible because it doesn t rely on massive amounts of graphics The different nations each have their own style of play The AI is challenging even when set to easy You can download new maps and other modifications from the internet I only reduced the rating to 4 because of problems with the interface It has a sort of unfinished feel to it For example when the game ends it always exits to windows rather than the main menu Also running a multiplayer game is very difficult and requires executing two instances of the game simultaneously 
An playable multiplayer turn based strategy game Difficult to learn and an awkward user interface besides that this is the best turn based strategy game I ever played It is ideal for Offline Multiplayer Serverbased or via PBEM since all players take their turns simultaneously which allows PBEM games to be finished within reasonable time Highly customizable OS independent Disappointed by WalordsIV I am now very happy to finally have found a cute playable turn based fantasy strategy game 
If you re a fan of the old classics If you aren t daunted by a little detail in a turn based strategy game and you don t mind graphics that fall short of the quot latest eye candy test quot and you re willing to spend some time bringing yourself up the learning curve you ll LOVE this game If you find any of the above 3 make you doubt you probably shouldn t get it But for me a turn based strategy junky to the core this game is an absolute gem Probably the best I ve bought in the last 5 years For a specific niche of gamer out there this one is extraordinary 
Best in Genre I believe this is the best game in the genre It s gotten more play out of me than Master of Magic Heroes of Might and Magic Age of Wonders Warlords Disciples Civilization Alpha Centauri Master of Orion Space Empires or Stars Once of the other posters says they have bad support but that s not been my experience I ve found their continued support and patches to be as good or better than any of the afore mentioned titles not bad for a 2 man team There is an amazing amount of variety in factions and would be gods you can play and best of all it is for the most part solidly based upon Mythology far superior to the typically D D derivative fantasy Multiplayer is fantastic It is a complex game however and not to everyone s tastes Definitely check out the demo first Beware though it s addictive stuff Also check out the fan made maps on their website as well some of which are quite pretty If you re stuck getting started try the excellent Walkthrough by Bruce Geryk also linked from their site

A Brilliant Device For those who dont what it is the Nintendo E Reader is an add on that goes into the cartridge slot of GBA and SP unsure about Game Boy Micro There is a paper thin slot in the bulky add on in which you scan cards to play classic nes games game and watch games Animal Crossing Cards Mario Bros 3 Cards Pokemon TCG Cards or Promo cards given out through Nintendo Power such as Kirby Slide The scanner is easy to use and has little trouble reading the cards Whats Included Included In one new E reader is the E Reader accesory the Classic Nes game Donkey Kong Jr and a sample pack which includes 3 Pokemon TCG Cards Machop Machoke and Machamp One Game and Watch Card Manhole and Animal Crossing Present Card Classic NES Games E Reader Classic Nes Games are sold in Packs that now Retail for 1 or 2 dollars each In the pack is 5 cards that have a code on the top and bottom that when scanned create a perfect playable NES game You might be thinking If the game has glitches or any other problems the answer is no The only noticable Difference is in the Donkey Kong JR game screen appears to be a bit smushed to fit the screen Classic Nes Games are the main reason to buy the E reader cause of there great quality and quantity Mario Bros 3 Cards E cards That when linked to a game boy advance SP with Super Mario Advanced 4 Mario Bros 3 can create levels show video demonstration of secrets or Give You Power ups Pokemon Trading Cards Whenn Nintendo bought the pokemon trading card game they aded some special features All cards from the Pokemon EX Series have codes on the bottom that when scanned give you information about that pokemon Now heres where the E Reader s True Poteneial Shows some cards have codes on the side that when combined with that pokemons evolution s other form s side codes create a minigame The 3 Pokemon Cards included have a Minigame when Combined giving you a perfect demonstration Also included in pokemon Ruby and Saphire is a card that when combined with the e reader lets your team battle a series of trainers Animal Crossing cards While linking a Game Boy Advance with an e reader to a Game Cube with animal crossing you can give yourself items and letters using the special machine located in the animal crossing post office Game and Watch cards Using one card with 2 bar codes on it you can play a Game and Watch Game The only one on card ever created was Man Hole A Game and Watch series was planned but was later dropped Mario party E Thhe Only E reader game in its own category Mario party e Includes 64 cards a Game Board and instructions In this Mixture of board Game and Video Game you scan various cards and play minigames to get coins or items from your opponent Overall The E Reader is now abondoned by nintendo meaning most likely no new games will ever be released As it has been this way for 2 years It is cheap to buy and works wonderfully But due to lack of any future support you should only buy it if you are in to Nes Games Animal Crossing or Pokemon EX Cards If you are into any of those than you will love this product and i recomend it 
Misinformed idiots People who dont know hat theyre talking about bug me The E reader is great but im here to clear up some mis conceptions 1 THE E READER WORKS W GBA SP You have to open it first but then it fits duh 2 The E Reader does NOT have the games already on it The games are actually in the dot codes Hard to believe but true They are not already on ur E Reader Nintendo has dropped support of it because it was somewhat of a flop and they were gearing up 4 the D 
Believe the hype I was a big fan of the first Kingdom Hearts it was truly a unique game Melding the worlds of Final Fantasy with Disney was a very interesting idea and its one that worked Kingdom Hearts II continues with the same basic formula so if you liked the original you will most definetly dig this one Everything that the oringinal did well II improves on The combat system is a vast improvement over the original and it remains fun over the 30+ hours In fact I wish there was more to experience Its that fun If your a disney fan you will dig being able to fight along different disney characters and explore those worlds All are very well done and diverse some in particular are just breathtaking The Pirates of the Carribean world comes to mind and its just awesome You actually feel like your apart of that world as you fight along with Captain Jack Sparrow The voice acting and animations add too the immersive nature Its amazing how well they get Johnny Depp s character you would think it his him in the game when he actually had nothing to do with the production The square characters get some great treament in the game as well as you run into many of them You ll even fight along side some of them and thats a treat as well If your a Final Fantasy fan you will absolutly eat up the more FF inspired moments in the game and it more than makes it a worthwhile experience if your not into disney The real draw for me is the story One of the best and most moving stories I ve ever had the pleasure of playing Its very interesting actually Surprisingly you start the game not playing Sora You play as Roxxas for the first 5 or so hours It serves as a introduction world but Roxxas is a key character to the story and you will have a blast playing as him Another thing I liked is that the story wraps up quite well you are not left hanging It has a satisfying conclusion and is much better than the first games ending Square Enix once again shows why they are one of the best in the business Kingdom Hearts II is a very polished product from the art style character designs the music on down to the extremely well done FMV s Its not without flaws it was a tad short for me I finished it under 35 hours and it was supposed to be much longer But regardless its a incredible journey and well worth devoting the time to play 
a great game Square and Disney coming together to bring us a video game turned out to really be a good move I think Kingdom Hearts II is an improvement over the original Maybe not a big improvement but enough to consider purchasing The graphics are really good and the difficulty is unfortunately sort of easy The game is really big and contains a MONSTER storyline so it s not like the easiness means you can blow through the game on a lazy Saturday afternoon It just means you won t have much trouble moving through the game I guess Axel was a fairly challenging fight Some other fights are sort of difficult as well I m not entirely sure what to think about the idea of having to complete certain tasks in order to progress forward but I guess it s not that big of a deal Worth buying Absolutely 
Surprisingly good game I decided to try this game because it was listed as a similar game that customers purchased with other games that I really like I am a fan of Longest Journey Syberia Gabriel Knight Broken Sword etc etc I wasn t expecting a whole lot when I started Keepsake but I was looking to kill time because I love PC games From the very start I was swept into the story the setting the characters I LOVE it when there is a fun mascot sharing your adventures The voice overs and some graphics really are pretty unrefined but that also makes the game more endearing These factors could be the reasons this game is not listed way up there with some of the other titles I mention I have added it to my list of favorite games and I play games ALOT 
Keepsake Great game lasts a long time challanging puzzles some easy some hard A lot of running around if you don t pay attention and save save save it also helps to take some notes Overall the best game I ve played recently 
A wonderful game I play adventure games on a regular basis and I really enjoyed this game for the following reasons 1 The storyline is well put together and made sense 2 The scenery can be quite breathtaking 3 The puzzles range from quite easy to extremely difficult but there is always the chance to get hints or if you spent way too much time on the puzzle and its time to move on you can get the solution 4 The main character interacted with others on a regular basis I m so tired of never encountering another person in adventure games 5 I initially thought the characters were going to be quite shallow and predictable but things change Great job on this one It s certainly one of my all time favorites 
Pretty Much Fantastic Best friends Lydia and Celeste were separated eight years ago when after the death of her mother Celeste s father became a director of the far off Dragonvale Academy Now Lydia is about to start her first day as a student of magic at Dragonvale and looks forward to being reunited with her friend But when she arrives she finds the academy deserted except for one odd character a wolf who claims to be a dragon Where is everybody What s going on here Can this wolf really be trusted These are just some of the questions you must answer as you explore the school Keepsake the first game from the Canadian Wicked Studios is a lovely 3D point and click adventure in the tradition of Syberia And I mean lovely literally the first thing to strike you is the beauty of the environments The castle is ornate with knotwork motifs and colour themes making exploration a pleasure There isn t a lot of animation but what there is is well done the water effect was especially nice Characters are slightly less well realised but still quite good The sound is also quite good The music is beautiful with a different haunting motif for each character and section of the castle The f x are somewhat limited and a bit repetetive lots of footsteps and bird calls fire and water sounds etc However they fit well with the design of the rest of the game so I can t complain I m very surprised to see so many complaints here about the dialog I really saw nothing wrong with it or the voice acting Rather conversation is used to explain points that are not necessarily elucidated by the action the philosophy of the magical system for example as well as to develop the characters and their relationships I considered that good writing not the opposite The game starts with a cute little tutorial in which one of the other game characters leads you through the controls I kind of liked that as I dislike reading manuals and it obviated the need for the kind of introductory sequence you find in a lot of games of this type you coul just jump right in The puzzles are quite a mix several straight games a couple mechanical including one that s quite involved some riddle type some inventory a kind of slider and a huge maze not counting the castle itself that is There are no timed puzzles and you can t die I liked the way the inventory worked once you had acquired the requisite item it was automatically used in the relevant spot So you didn t have to keep opening your inventory picking up the item clicking it on the hotspot etc As for the rest they were fairly straightforward EXCEPT for the riddle type The clues provided were so obscure that I can t believe anyone but the designers could possibly make sense of them Fortunately the game includes a hint feature which give three hints for each puzzle after which it offers to solve the puzzle for you I had to use the solve feature once when even having the clues explained didn t do much to enlighten me But when you use the solve feature you don t actually get to see the solution just the result of it So I still don t know what that puzzle was about The hint feature also will tell you if you don t have the prerequisistes necessary to continue a puzzle If you use it when you re not in puzzle view it will clarify your next objective I found both these aspects very helpful I did experience one bizarre glitch with the game at intervals without reason or warning the sound would suddenly start to stutter and echo in a most annoying way Adjusting game settings had no effect I eventually discovered that I could correct the problem by exiting the game and rebooting my computer This seemed to be necessary once every couple hours I completed Keepsake in about 25 hours possibly a little more I was deligthed that it kept me busy so long as most adventure games these days barely provide 10 hours of play Some of the second part of the game did get a little draggy with a lot of toiling back and forth through the castle However Keepsake is a good choice for gamers who like straight adventure in a fantasy context But for the glitch and a couple illogical puzzles I would have given it five stars I eagerly look forward to Wicked Studios next effort 
Basically a good game No this game isn t perfect you ll be annoyed by the dialogue luckily you can fast forward through it and the cut scenes unfortunately you CAN T fast forward through those BUT it s filled with tons of things to solve and if you get stuck you can have the game solve it for you This game will keep you busy for a while but fair warning it s CORNY 
Fun Fun Fun Ok this game was overall fun There are however moments that just make you want to slap whoever designed it When you are in this school for most of the whole game it is huge and you are walking everywhere Sometimes when there arises a puzzle you have to walk all over the school to find the answer Then when you think your almost there you are on the top layer of the school This is better because now you can just teleport everywhere where as you couldn t do that before But you are still trying to figure out which teleport to take Yes the acting is lacking but who really cares I did love the scenery with the waterfalls and such Very beautiful and the puzzles were good too Some of them seemingly impossible to solve and some very easy I am a person who loves to try and figure out things and if you don t use any cheats or help this should take you a while to get through I enjoyed it really I did Just make sure you have alot of time to play it 
Great game this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice 
not bad at all get it now before it s gone I wasn t sure if I wanted to purchase this game because it got so many bad reviews From Magazines Amazon reviewers and G4TV However because I love Puss N Boots and because of the recent price drop I decided to give it a go Well it s not like final fantasy as many have compared it to It s more like Gauntlet Dark Legacy The graphics are really good To address another criticism the game is not a cheap movie novelty created from left over scraps My only complaint is that you can t choose the characters you want for each level They are choosen for you However you can switch from the 4 characters given and most of them are cool Fun Factor=3 5 Replayability=3 Graphics= 4 5 Controls=5 Camera Angles=3 5 Mostly young teens and under will enjoy this game Even if you dont like shrek this game will appeal to Grims fairy tale fans like me I got mine new from EBGAMES for only 9 99 hurry before they are gone 
From 4 to 15 and beyond This game has been enjoyed by the family from my 4 year old who likes to play Fiona on up to in clude friends of the family The game loosely follows the movie with the additions of other characters and does not require high skill levels to play The contols are simple and you can pick it up and put it down without losing any of the momentum of knowledged gained while playing It is good simple fun 
A terrific finish to a wonderful trilogy Not quite as programming sound as Sands of Time SOT but thankfully far removed from The Warrior Within WW The Two Thrones TT is arguably the most enjoyable of the three next generation titles Visually TT is a masterpiece Advancing upon the beautiful artwork in the first two offerings TT presents a gaming environment that a gamer can truly grasp his her eyes around Lighting facial expressions body language even pottery specifics are all drawn to perfection The audio is in sync with these strengths the music is terrific sound effects digitally crisp step on your first dinner plate or pot to get a sense of this Moreover gone are most of the blind jumps in WW camera glitches of SOT The characters themselves and the weapons they carry are likewise individualistic works of art UBISoft Montreal obviously thought this one through from the flaws of the previous two entries when creating visuals The control scheme is similarly quite polished SOT still lays claim to the tightest of all 3 but TT is close behind Perhaps a by product of a visual environment that is truly interactive Stealth mode is a blast and perfectly fused into game dynamics From a pure gaming perspective absolute genius The dark prince is a hoot to play + a wonderful change of pace the challenges that face you suitable for the gaming stage you encounter them Unlike WW secondary weapons are now key elements of gameplay Weapons racks are appropriately placed to provide a weapons edge when needed Finally puzzles while ocassionally more frustrating than fun can be conquered A Prince of Persia veteran will most likely not require a FAQ a stalwart of WW unfortunately to conquer TT A newbie will require a moderate high learning curve This game however is not without flaws Several reviewers refer to frustrating encounters in the game the second chariot + the boss battle that follows is the most obvious that will require dual save points and sufficient sands of time stored well in advance to proceed past Not to mention a glitch that might require a restart of the entire game Ugh These are by products of a second rushed title expedited to keep gamers interested after a poor WW As someone who has played every Prince of Persia title since its first offering TT is a nice return to its roots For new gamers and as alluded to above I highly recommend playing out the entire Sands of Time series in its release order TT will both make a lot more sense while seeming more intuitive as a result Not to mention a storyline that keeps you glued for just one more save point Highly recommended Will be fascinating to discover what and where the next Prince of Persia will be and appear on 
WOW First off this game is very addicting and so much fun Prince of Persia The Two Thrones really takes you back to what was so great about Sands of Time One thing I really found enjoyable about this game was the story You really find yourself attached to certain characters and it brings you into the game Another great thing about this game is the gameplay which again brings the player back to the greatness of Sands of Time One thing I fing great is all the action that is encountered throughout the game Having the ability to sword slash through enemies gives this game a nice balance Without this the game would be purely platform and while this could be fun it definetely needs the action to keep it feeling alive The ability to use the quick kills is also very entertaining The bosses in the game are also fantastic Each of them are very different in the way you fight them which is something I found to help keep the game fresh Some are very platform feeling the way you fight and others are much more action quick kill like Another cool addition in The Two Thrones is the Dark Prince Although at times he seems a bit overpowered the addition of him was well needed and made the game very fun Overall I thought this game brought back the feel of Sands of Time and although it still lacks slightly in gameplay than the first it is still great and definetley better than Warrior Within Presentation The story is great and keeps the player attached to this game It is truly back to its roots and people who liked Sands of Time are going to love this game Graphics The graphics in this game are very nice and the environments are fantastic Sound The voice acting in this game is fantastic The music is also great and definitely creates a nice mood for the game Gameplay The gameplay is great I love the quick kills and they truly add a new demention to the game Lasting Appeal The game feels a bit short can be beat in 7 10 hours Although there are unlockables there isn t that much incentive to play through the game all the way through a second time 
Two Princes one Outcome Prince of Persia The Two Thrones Circa 2005 GOOD More balanced combat when compared to pervious game Prince of Persia Warrior Within New Speed kill system although difficult some times make stealth kills dramatic and flashy Use a Chariot in some levels Boss battles are more balanced when compared to pervious game Prince of Persia Warrior Within Play as the Dark Prince an evil version of the prince on some levels Note that Dark Prince has different powers abilities and acrobatics Lots of unlockable art work and mini movies BAD Dark Prince Levels feel like there timed because his health is always slowing falling Chariot levels could be better IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE This Prince of Persia game really is a combination of the last two games in terms of story more like that of Sands of Time and gameplay like that of Warrior Within although there is enough new elements to make it feel unique If you liked the pervious Prince of Persia games you will most likely like this as well GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO Prince of Persia Sands of Time Prince of Persia Warrior Within ADDITIONAL NOTES Bonus section has pictures movies from all three Prince of Persia game 
Easily the best of the trilogy I ve been a fan of the Prince of Persia series since I was a little kid PoP 1 was great Pop 2 was absolutely unreal PoP 3D was ehhh but then two years ago along came a game that changed everything Prince of Persia The Sands of Time the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone s breath away The gameplay was original flawless and beautiful The storyline sucked you in and didn t let you go even after you d beaten it 6 times over It was a flawless game Last year the first sequel Prince of Persia Warrior Within was released While the game contained improvements in the quality of the graphics and the freeform fighting techniques the game was less pleasing to both critics and gamers Ubisoft had turned the humrous witty intelligent prince from Sands into an angry nu metal rocking humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent on ruining everyone s time While the story was equally as engaging as Sands Warrior failed because it simply was not as much fun to play Luckily Ubisoft saved the best for last The Two Thrones is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played In concluding one of the greatet videogame trilogies ever created Ubisoft have developed a near flawless game It is as though they took the strengths from both games removed the weaknesses of the second game and created a thing of pure brilliance The Two Thrones contains all of the witty punning elements from the first game and mixes them with the exciting more violent elements from the second game while removing everying that ruined the prince s demeanor in the second game The original fun saracastic prince is back and largely because Ubisoft has also brought back one of the things that made Sands so great Farrah Farrah is the perfect foil to our hero She adds humor power creativity and definitely a sexiness to the game that Warrior was lacking Farrah s relationship with the prince is by far my favorite relationship I ve ever played in a videogame and Ubisoft deserves big brownie points for bringing her back The gameplay in The Two Thrones is amazing Throughout the game the gamer is occassionally forced to play as the Dark Prince as there are situations where the normal original prince is unable to get through In other games playing as two characters often appeared more of a gimmick than an actual integral part of the story but in The Two Thrones the reasoning behind the Prince s frequent changing from Prince to Dark Prince and back again is very well explained and very important to the overall story that Two Thrones is telling The fight scenes are epicly fun to play This Prince has more moves than he had in the two last games combined and his battle techniques are a joy to use The new speed kill method of killing some opponents adds a certain amount of skill and brutality to many fights that otherwise would have seemed boring and taken far too long to complete I welcomed the addition of the speed kills once I fully learned how to use them The Prince still moves as acrobatically as ever There is still wall running jumping flipping handsprings etc the only real notable movement difference is when the gamer plays as the Dark Prince The Dark Prince s chain weapon thing can be used to grab onto bars that are are away or objects that would otherwise be out of reach and the Prince can then swing over to them It s not that different from anything the Prince has done before but it was definitely fun to do and worked well with the flow of the game All in all I rate this the best of the new Sands PoP trilogy It s an awesome game that should be played by anyone who has ever enjoyed a 3rd person adventure game If you haven t played either one of the first two games be warned the storyline is actually rather complex and you will be missing much of the story if you haven t played the first two games If you have played the first two games this story is a terrific conclusion to the Prince s tale and the way it wraps around back to the beginning of the trilogy floored me when I finished it Buy this game something worth noting after you beat the game you unlock many videos chief among these is the alternate real ending to Warrior Within that was formerly only available if you beat Warrior after collecting all the life upgrades so if you beat Warrior without all the life upgrades and didn t see the real ending beating this game shows it to you in the video collection 
BEST OF THE SERIES I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS GAME AND I HAVE NOT PUT MY CONTROLLER DOWN THE STORYLINE IS AWESOME THE GAME IS VERY WELL BALANCED GRAPHICS SUPERB THE FIRE EFFECTS ALONG WITH THE TORN DOWN BABILONIAN CITY JUST LOOKS AMAZING SO NICE THAT YOU JUST STOP PLAYING AND STARE FOR A WHILE YES ITS THAT GOOD THE MUSIC IS 100 ADEQUATE ARABIAN NOT LIKE THE RIDICULOUS ROCK THEMES FROM PART 2 ON THIS ONE HE HAS LIKE A DOUBLE PERSONALITY ALTER EGO TYPE ON THING WHICH ALSO ADDS KUDOS TO THE GAME IN OTHER WORDS THE PRINCE NOW LOOKS AS SLICK AS DANTE AND GOD OF WAR AND RYU FROM NINJA GAIDEN YES IT GIVES YOU THAT BAD FEELING FROM WHAT I HEARD THIS GAME HAS AN AWESOME CONCLUSION IT IS TRULY A MUST HAVE SINCE THIS WRAPS UPS THE TRYLOGY AND IT DOES IT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY GIVING YOU THE BEST EXPERIENCE YOULL EVER GONNA HAVE WITH THE SERIES OHH I ALMOST FORGOT THE STEALTH KILLS TOTALLY AWESOME ITS A QUICK WAY TO DISPATCH OF YOUR ENEMIES WITH THE TOUCH OF A BUTTON IF DONE IN PROPER TIME AND BOY DOES IT LOOK GOOD YOU CAN ALSO HANG FROM YOUR DAGGER ONCE YOUR AGAINST A WALL AND FROM THERE RUN SIDEWAYS AND EVEN JUMP THE OPPOSITE WAY AMAZING SO MANY NICE THINGS ABOUT IT THAT MY FINAL WORDS ARE BUY THIS ONE IT DESERVES IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT ITS SOMETHING TO HAVE OVER THE TIMES 
Econ 101 This is a very entertaining game It isn t one of the action packed varieties but it has given me hours of enjoyment without the pressure of being shot at It s not for everyone but if you like to master the basic economics of building a city it s fun 
Great Game This is an excellent game People who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game 
A good Replacement to cable We had a cable go bad on us and I could never find a replacement Finally I saw the wireless device I bought this for my daughter She and I play pokemon on GBA We no longer have to be within cable reach but at least in the same room Matter of fact we have more fun now The wireless is faster than cable Its easy to put on and take off You can hook up with multiple players using the wireless Note you can t use the wireless and cable its either or Also with GBA you have to have the newer games that says wireless Its not backwards compatible Recommend this device and the GBA TV Adapter 
wireless adaptor My children enjoy being able to play gameboy games together now with the adaptor 
One of the best fighting games on the ps2 Fans of this game s genre are always looking for a great fighter for their console and because their are comparatively far less fighting games it s quite rare to find a trully impressive one Tekken however has always taken the cake when it comes to a deep fun and proffesional fighting experience and does Tekken 5 have all these great qualities Definetly Whether you re a hardcore gamer or just want to have some fun with your buddies you ve found the perfect title Namco does an extremely fluid job of breaking all the barriers of fighting game entertainment There is so much veriety so much to do to unlock to enjoy that whether you like these types of game or not you will be hooked Take me im a critic a tough one for that matter and I can t find a single thing wrong with this game other then the fact that an online mode wasn t included But how much will it matter when you have a rich deep gameplay system extrodinary visuals outstanding replay value and 30 count them 30 intruiging playable character to battle with and master I say this without a studder this will have you playing for hours upon hours with a friend or relative becuase this is one of those games where there is little more to ask for 5 
Graphics overhaul but audio is neglected To be sure the graphics have had the most significant update since Tekken 2 And Namco was very careful to keep the gameplay mechanics perfectly in tact However the Tekken 5 BGM tracks didn t seem to keep pace with the innovation A few good songs here and there but overall not a cohesive OST 
Good stuff It works great great quality great sound and ESPECIALLY great color detail only thing that sucks is actually getting the cables into the tv plugs it s horrible on most tv s i ve seen with component plugs the plugs are are built very close together and each of the component ends blue green red where the cap kind of goes over actual thing you put in the usually gold plated thing are almost too big so you can t fully plug in all 5 of them 3 video 2 audio but just kinda have to push em in just enough so that it actually works other than that the quality and everything is fantasti 
Lots of fun better than owning a karaoke machine This game was a lot of fun The microphone headset works great The only downside is I wish it had more songs but I guess that is what sequals are for Overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself 
Satisfy your inner green guy Parents The content in this game seems absolutally fine for anyone roughly ten and up The only reason I see it as rated teen is because this game requires a good bit of hand eye cordination sometimes Aslo the hulk roaring might get to little kids who are still around the age where they still come up to you in the middle of the night to check there closets for monsters but basicly if your kids can handel action cartoons like Ninja Turtles and Justice League they deffinately can handel this game Anyways I wasn t sure about this game when I picked it up I don t know why I hadn t heard much about it and I hadn t played many comic book based games besides the Spiderman based one on the Playstation But I didn t see many other games at the rental store the kids could play on my XBox so I rented it out to see if it was okay It is in my opinion an absolutaly great game for almost anyone The entire game was like a digital stress ball for me you get to rampage to your hearts desire I spent a few hours alone that week just ignoring the story chapters completely and just wrecking the huge city and desert military bases to game takes place in Kids would also love it for the same reason they build lego houses and then smash them to bits with their action figures The story is a bit odd if you don t know much about the hulk already as it revolves around bruces quest for a cure in order to stop a second more evil and cunning Hulk Bruce Banner Discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named the Devil Hulk The big green savage Hulk we all know and love also doesn t like the Devil Hulk moving in to Banner s mind so it becomes more agreeable to suconicous orders Banner uses to get the child like brute to do what he wants Meanwhile a new baddie called the Abomination appears after one of the military general stupidly trys to recover one of bruce s failed cure attempts in the very begining of the game All in all the story is okay as you go on but you can tell they tried to stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into a game story only as an excuse to callenge you with bosses and other unique situations As far a gameplay goes it s fantasic The more damage you cause the more smash points you earn and the more moves you can buy later too continue your assult on just about everything There are mini games and secrets everywhere to earn even more smash points with In fact the only thing that s missing is a co op or two player mode As far as replayability goes it s always there Anyway I would recommended this game to a anyone who has kids roughly around ten b anyone who likes third person single player games and c anyone one who has been stress out at work one too many times or feels like throwing a temper tantrum 
My New Favorite Game If somebody came up to you and said Here have some super powers what would you do Well The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction basically allows you to take the super powers and run rampant with them in just about any way you want While it doesn t contain the level of violence or crime that Grand Theft Auto has and lets face it that s what everyone will be comparing this game to it doesn t need to It also does not contain the depth of story that GTA is so good about But lets face it when you do and elbow drop onto someone s head from 50 stories up you can sacrifice some things to do that When you can hurl a tank into a helicopter and watch them both explode and almost be able to feel the impact of the explosion everything else just kind of fades into the background anyway I just beat the game a few days ago and I don t even remember the first few story missions because I spent so much time just running through the city smashing things and jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper thoroughly enjoying every second of it You can lose yourself in this game and play for hours without realizing it just like you can GTA but instead of getting frustrated at the game you actually feel a sense of relief each time you pound one of your opponents mercilessly into the ground and repeatedly stomp on thier heads let out a growl and kick them across the street Anger management has never felt so good 
WOW Hands down the best superhero game ever So many moves to acquire it will keep you playing for a long time Even after you finish it you ll want to go back just to destroy everything Good anger management that s for sure Note Don t bother playing the mini games to gain extra points There fun but useless You can acquire just as much if not more points just free roaming Plus you ll improve your fighting skills because the game gets harder as you go along 
Finds a middle ground between the mediocrity of the first title and the excellence of the second In a way Jak 3 is more of a direct sequel to chapter two than it is a continuation of the storyline that was established in part one I realize that this was meant to be the end of a journey a coming of age story that follows the title character through his innocence his adolescence and finally his ascent into adulthood Bearing in mind it s only natural that he d want to distance himself from the people and places that make him feel like an adventuring child rather than a self assured saver of globes When I became a man I put away childish things after all Where the inspiration behind the storytelling of Jak II was unquestionably Blade Runner the main source of direction for this final chapter comes largely from Mel Gibson s The Road Warrior The outlanders who rescue the title endorsed duo from their exile and drag them back to their own makeshift shanty town are the textbook definition of an early 80s burly man They adorn themselves with hundreds of pointy edges enormous hopelessly detailed weapons and layer after layer of questionably hemmed leather They puff out their chests at every opportunity and speak like a cluster of throat cancer survivors These new characters are just overflowing with personality which makes the minor cutscenes and motivational speeches entertaining but I couldn t shake the feeling that they were just going through the motions in an attempt to mimic the successful main cast of the second game It s like they were trying to match the edge of the gritty sullen warriors of Jak II but were missing some intangible element that kept them from reaching that full potential The twists and turns of their storylines were somewhat transparent I d figured out the major twist in Damas s story within an hour of meeting him their importance to the central plot is thrown into question fairly early on when you return to the city around the three hour mark and only occasionally return to the desert thereafter and for all of their gusto their emotional impact on the player doesn t hold a candle to the inner city gangs that ran chapter two As the last game in the series Daxter on the PSP and Jak X Combat Racing have since been released continuing the saga and there are rumors of a new game on the PS3 Jak 3 is an atypical grand finale A lot of things didn t happen that I expected to during the wrap up cutscene at the very end and vice versa I was caught off guard by more than a few revelations including the Wizard of Oz styled reveal just before the final boss For the first time I think the series found its stride in the vein of comedy it had sought since day one The character interactions are actually very funny in places I legitimately laughed out loud on more than one occasion which is not something I m known to do during a game With the outline in place and the unexpected twists and turns counteracting the few more obvious revelations Jak 3 s story would have set the stage for one of the greatest final chapters in video gaming history if only it were a bit longer Jak 3 weighs in at about a dozen hours which is less than half the length of Jak II and that results in a much less rewarding experience than you d hope for in a final episode It also wasn t nearly as difficult as its immediate predecessor which means less screaming and shouting but also less relief and self assuredness upon reaching that final scene After completing part two I had a sense of accomplishment almost pride at having finished such an elaborate and difficult game I didn t get that same sensation upon putting this one to bed One area in which Jak 3 doesn t disappoint is the holy crap department It just spoils you with these things you ll control Daxter as he clings for dear life onto a speeding missle a live freaking MISSLE you ll leap onto a teensy platform while the camera leers above you and displays the dizzying heights below you ll take down creatures the size of a whale just unimaginably cool stuff It doesn t overload on the action in quite the way that God of War did but it s pretty close and the last full hour of gameplay is one of those long moments that transcends mere video gaming and puts the player right into the middle of a summer blockbuster I ve long considered the last stage of the original Halo to be one of the if not the greatest level in the history of gaming and I d seriously consider the closing moments of Jak 3 at least on par with that So yeah very high praise indeed In both the grand finale and throughout the entirety of the game there s a lot of variety in the gameplay This is not just your standard jump shoot and explore adventure game You ll bump into an odd blend of flight stages DDR style coordination stages racing levels and railed first person shooter segments in addition to the exploring jumping punching shooting and all around adventuring levels And while this is something I had a big problem with when it was shoved into the mechanics of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it doesn t bother me so much here The main reason is because the Jak series has always had some sort of similar variety ingrained within it but it s also a bit more admissible here because the setup actually works Nothing feels like it s been needlessly crammed into the proceedings like the dance stages or the workout levels of San Andreas it all just works together several parts of a whole While the basic gameplay model and its dedication to consistently bending genres has remained mostly intact there are two notable variations from the functionality of Jak II that become abundantly clear within the first couple of hours First and foremost is the much much heavier emphasis that s placed on the driving stages more so than in The Precursor Legacy and Jak II combined In this third chapter they re vital to the completion of half the game s levels including the final boss fight It s almost to the point that I d call this an action racing title because you ll find yourself spending as much time behind the wheel as you are on foot When it was successful the vehicle based gameplay was a blast something that s never really been tried before a sort of supercharged platformer on wheels On the few stages that failed however the wheels felt like a gimmicky death trap Incredibly frustrating like trying to shove a square peg through a round opening Largely the vehicle stages were a roaring success however Secondly there s the revelation that there is a Light Jak to mirror the beastial Dark Jak that was unveiled in the second game Where Jak s darker persona brought with it a variety of new attacks and offensive maneuvers his light side focuses more on exploratory aids and defensive mechanisms As such it s not quite as exciting to play as Light Jak for the first time as it was to burst into Dark Jak mode near the opening of Jak II It s just not as much fun to grow wings and casually flutter around a room as it is to fire purple lightning out of your fingertips and fry the opposition These light powers enable a few new modes of exploration for the die hard fan but are generally fairly useless and go unused until the situation demands that you employ them F As far as controls are concerned it s a pretty tight ship at this point in the series Most of the infuriating glitches and bugs from the first game were ironed out in the second chapter and the third game actually improves upon the near perfection attained by the second A few jump commands go unrecognized and I had some problems with touchy collision detection during the faster races which meant I had to hit the checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again but those are minor gripes at best Visually this could pass as Jak II s identical twin The characters look almost exactly the same as in the previous chapter and all of the little quirks cartoony exaggerations and background puns that gave the first two games their identity are here in living color It s not the best looking game I ve ever played and I didn t notice much of a difference upon switching to progressive scan but it s near the top of its genre all the same I d imagine the phrase ain t broke don t fix it could be applied to Jak 3 without hesitation The voice acting is one area that s been kept fairly high in quality throughout the series and that legacy is kept up here Where the story falters the voice actors often revive it and vice versa it s a good collaboration The scenes are routinely stolen by Daxter and or the villains who go above and beyond in their pursuit of a good reading that matches the circumstances while Jak is kept fairly low key and stoic It s for the best too because on the few occasions where he does decide to go all macho and tries to spit out a line like let s go kill us some metal heads it doesn t fit and he comes across as awkward and unsure Upon completing the second game I likened it to The Empire Strikes Back in that it took a fairly light hearted series and transformed it into a more adult oriented saga with incredible results For what it s worth that Star Wars parallel carries over fairly accurately with this third chapter you ll get lots of warm fuzzies at the end and it s not quite as weighty or substantial as the second chapter but overall it s still a very entertaining experience with a cast of characters you can t help but love The big action scenes are really done fabulously and there s rarely a dull moment but this game suffers from the unbelievable quality of the game that immediately preceded it 
This game is awsome This is the best jak game in the series The handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur The game is not easy which is good Graphics are good as well If you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game Overall I give this game a perfect 10 
Awesome Game Star Wars Battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever such as the Rebel Alliance Imperials Republic and CIS Confederacy of Independent Systems The 3 D graphics make it easier to enjoy as well for sound and storyline In Battlefront you can not play as featured characters in the saga but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels Another disadvantage is you can t wield a lightsaber either In Instant Action you get to pick any location and any side to fight for You also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war As a matter of fact you can drive vehicles but no space combat If you want to play on Episode III battlefields your hopes are up Only locations from episodes I II IV V and VI There are numbers of areas to battle on But for pros and cons cons are going to have a hard time through the game such as What type of soldier Where is my command post Where is my enemy at For pros there is nothing wrong Star Wars battlefront is one of the best star wars games there is about Star Wars along with the perfect gameplay terrific graphics and great sound I highly recommend the game to any star wars buff s out there 
My 2nd favorite star wars game of all time I m not a 1st 3rd person shooter fan But this game s graphics and sheer re playability won me over I actually played Battlefront II before I but the original seems much much better than the sequel P S Best star wars game ever X Wing Alliance What can I say I m old school 
Best Star Wars Game Ever by far Until Battlefront II This is a great game wow Be on any side you want play online choose where you play choose your type of soldier its all in your hands Xbox live great single player this is an amazing game I do watch all the star wars movies but im not a huge fan however this is still definitely one of the top 10 games ive ever played Dont even think about buying this game just buy it No matter if your a fan of star wars or not youll love it 
Must have for Xbox 360 owners I am very hooked on this controller At first I thought the idea of a wire less controller was just more hassle but I m completely convinced now Mainly cause it stops my biggest fear from happening someone pulling my console down This didn t happen on the first Xbox because of the quick disconnect but it has happened quite a few times with my PS2 and i would die if my 360 fell Also this feels more like a remote now instead of just a game controller making it easy to go through your system in the dark and know your no gonna trip if you get up Finally I have owned almost every console from the NES and this is by far the best controller I have used Just buy it already 
wireless controller I m happy to have another wireless controller to use for co op and versus games 
Must have When I upgraded to the 360 I was a bit saddened that I would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing First wireless No tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have Also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also although I m sure they re on the wired controllers quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game Plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch 
I found only one problem with this controller The controller is excellent but for some reason the creator put four little knots on the controller joystick I have no ideal why but if you use this controller to play a fast paced game like boxing watch out because the tips of your thumb will hurt I am talking real pain It takes the fun out of the game you are playing I would give this controller a 5 star rating if it wasn t for the 4 knots on the joystick hopefully more people will complain and they will remove them This shows that the developers don t play the games long enough 
Wireless is perfect I just bought my 360 and ordered an extra wireless controller on another site cheaper with free shipping too and I love them so far They never lose connection and they are nice to hold No wires holding you down either My only gripe about these are that they don t come with a rechargable battery Why make a next generation system and have the state of the art wireless controllers run on AA s Ohh wait We can charge an extra 12 bucks to sell battery packs and another 30 for a recharging kit Other than that they are great I saved the money on the recharging cable and bought the recharging dock that comes with 1 battery pack and I bought 3 other battery packs so I d always have wireless with no wires Thats the way to go But SHAME ON YOU MICROSOFT 
Unbelievable I have had SERIOUS problems with wireless controllers on previous generation consoles Let s be serious the wireless controllers for the gamecube PS2 and original xbox were HORRIBLE You had to stand within like 10 feet of the TV and if someone turned on a radio in the house your controller would not respond I have no such problems w the 360 s wireless controller This one works GREAT I got mine with the 360 premium package and I plan on buying another one soon I love the format of the new 360 controler with the Xbox button in the center The controller turns off after like 30 min of not using during movies etc but you can turn it on again by just pushing the button The console responds just as fast to the wireless controller as the wired one Microsoft has definetly created the greatest game controller ever built I definetly do not see myself going back to a wired controller any time soon There is no reason why a 360 owner should not have this 
have the light blue it s great As I have said I have the blue DS and it is great I don t have any big fancy words to describe it but it s durable dropped many times works just as good as the day I got it have 5 or so games for it nintendo dogs new super mario mario vs donkey kong march of the minis monopoly Gameboy Advance oh yeah it s GA compatible mario kart and some other crazy game my husband liked anyway buy extra pens if you have children they get lost quickly it s wireless so you can use it against another DS the nintendo dogs game senses other dog owners and you can hook up and play with their dog Easy to use with it being handheld I was weary of the fact you have your hands so close together and a small screen but I have never had a problem with it unless you play the new super mario bros on it then your thumbs begin to cramp because of the addiction to the game Battery life is good as well it can last on a charge for a long while 3 4 days without having to charge if you play it for only a few hours a day Several games and good ones at that read some of my game reviews Overall go out and get one your whole family will love it 
it plays vidoes and music also for those who are deciding to buy a psp becasue it has the ability to play movies and music The DS can also do this too with a attachment that accpets compact flah cards that you can load your media on it from your computer and play it on your d 
Geekdom at its best There is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than Dungeons and Dragons and that is Star Wars This game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things It is a flawless game 
One of the most addicting games that I ve ever played I am a huge Star Wars fan but I don t really like RPG s all that much at least not video games I do play DnD That said this game absolutely blew me away As a DnD player I knew that there wouldn t be a learning curve on the game since it uses the D20 system Knowing the system really helped with feat selection and such as there really wasn t anything outlandishly new I was however a little disappointed with the small number of Force powers that were in the game I don t think that I would bother having my main character be a Jedi Consular as you can really get a decent amount of Force powers even with a Jedi Guardian and if you have some Wisdom enhancing items you can use those powers often as well The character creation system is pretty standard I was slightly disappointed that you have to be human as I really wanted to create a lightsaber wielding Wookie but for the purpose of the story it won t take you long to figure out that being human is definitely a good thing on Taris And the fact that a Wookie eventually joined my party later adequetely mollified me In fact it really doesn t matter too much what kind of character you make because the party members that you pick up throughout the game pretty much have everything covered One small warning without giving too much away in your travels you will meet a party member and in order to explore his backstory you will need your main character to have a decent rank in the repair skill It s not really a big deal if you re set on making a Soldier Jedi Guardian that is amazing in melee combat but will not be able to raise that skill too much But for you perfectionists that like to explore every single aspect of the game you should keep this in mind And another note to you perfectionists you will not explore every aspect of the game in one run This is because your actions throughout the game will determine whether you become a hero for the Light Side of the Force or fall to the Dark Side Naturally there are two different endings And I imagine that the game experience is a bit different as well I personally stuck to the Light Side which can be a little more difficult at times since you ll be helping people more However this also means that you will do more side quests I imagine that the Dark Side would be somewhat of a guilty pleasure as you can just kill people that seek your aid and you can progress through the game a little faster by taking the quick and easy path There is also the third option of pretty much balancing yourself and being neutral Respond as an evil Sith occasionally and sometimes as a valiant Jedi And you can usually respond neutrally as well Overall I d say that the aspect of this game that shines the brightest is the story and the characterization that takes place this is another reason to stick with the Light Side oftentimes you can just tell your party members to shut the hell up and gain dark side points but you won t get to explore their backstories and discover their motivations Anyone that is a Star Wars fan will thoroughly enjoy playing a game with a story that is nearly on par with the movies and even better than the prequels Obviously the story is a bit restricted since it IS a video game and meant to be played but the plot is certainly better than any video game I ve played before and when I was younger I did play games like Golden Sun and Baldur s Gate KOTOR beats them hands down And most of it is pretty new territory as the game takes place a few thousand years before the movies I ll close with a few warnings First you d better have a good graphics card if you want to play this game You should be fine if you meet the minimum system requirements but the first time I tried to install this game on my older computer still not that old though it didn t have a good enough graphics card The computer that it s on now still doesn t meet the recommended system requirements but it s more or less fine That leads me into my final warning there are some bugs with the game After only a few hours at a certain point the game would freeze up and occasionally exit to Windows I was worried that I wouldn t be able to complete the game because it happened many times I downloaded the updates for the game and this did help some but it didn t completely solve the problem Eventually I turned off something silly like grass effects or shadows and that caused it to happen much less frequently I guess all that is left to say is that if you re a Star Wars fan you should buy this game Even if you re not it s still worth playing through especially if you like RPG s Oh and this goes without saying but quick save often 
This is the best game ever The reason I liked this game so much was the story line It gives you choices to whether you want go to the light side or dark side and you could enhance a variety of Jedi powers I have played this game serveral times and each time is different The first time I went through this game I relied a lot on my swordsmanship with my lightsaber The second time I played this game I relied more on my Jedi powers Either way you play it I developed a different set of moves It was awesome Also I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PLAY A WOMAN In every other Star Wars Game except this sequel you have to play a man and it gets a little irritating when you like adventure games just as much as any guy I give the story line and the capabilities of the Jedi FIVE STARS 
It makes a HUGE difference When it comes to the GC GBA Cable You wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games But it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in Gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing Depending on the game and what features it opens up Plus it is cheap to get and once you ve gotten this wonderful item You will wonder why you didnt get it sooner I know from my own experience 
advance cable The Nintendo GC GB Advance Cable adds some new features to some of its systems most popular games Although I do not own every game this item enhances I do own a few From what I have played Animal Crossing Pokemon Harvest Moon ect this product has provided just a little more fun Although it is not a gaming essential die hard Nintendo fans of both the portable and non portable systems will definitely want to buy this item and explore new options provided by the cable 
tooooooo cooooooool This cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy player on Final Fantas 
Nintendo RPGs have always been and will always be my favorites I haven t finished this game though I m quite close to it I have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that I ve had in a long time I laughed out loud more than a few times was nearly constantly smiling and was thoroughly amused with all the little details Not much stylus action but then again did you really expect there to be My boyfriend s highly considering getting a DS Lite simply so he can play this game 
Funnest Game on any platform I loved this game I played all the way through The difficulty level is low to medium I love games like this Instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through It kept my interest Had good gameplay and graphics Didn t annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again I loved it I also loved the Mario and Luigi prequel to this on GBA It s kinda of a light RPG with action elements I wish they made all RPG s like this It s short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition Give it a shot It s a lovely game 
Awesome Game I m so glad I listened to the fine reviewers on Amazon and bought this game it was worth every penny and then some It has a lot of really great game play and I love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks I feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters you wouldn t feel right about Mario and Luigi casting spells like the characters from Final Fantasy but it s perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells And as weird as that sounds it makes for a great RPG Lots of good side missions too like collecting the beans Wonderful game 
Dino stalker will rock Dino Stalker will rock It should be on the XBOX becouse its graphics are so good 
Fun but BROKEN I bought this game on a whim I am not a Spyro fan For the first few hours I found it quite enjoyable It had colorful graphics cool moves and even some humorous aspects Unfortuneately it is UNBELIEVABLY frustrating I m quite skilled with platformers but this game required perfect timing accuracy etc All this led to a lot of anger on my part Still I might have managed to work through it if it hadn t BROKE Yes that s right when I tried to turn it on again the XBox refused to read my saved file And I must admit I had no desire to start over Eventually I sold this game and my XBox Sorry Vivendi sorry Bill Gates You ll both have to come up with something less faulty next time 
Charging The DS Lite The success of the Nintendo DS Lite brought out so many new gamers to a whole new generation of handheld gamers Yet for those who purchased the original DS any of those have a set AC adapter to call their own However for the newer editions you d have to tackle a different way to plug in and charge up your Nintendo DS system Well this DS Lite AC Adapter from Nintendo is very convient and easy to install Although there is one disadvantage with this AC Adapter With this one you unfortunately can t use this with the original Nintendo DS Still if you had to choose a adapter to charge up your Nintendo DS I really recommend one from Nintendo over another company Price A Convience A Overall 
GREAT GAME Horrible service Amazon For Christmas I bought this item for my child who is very into the likes of this product I thought What s cooler than having a video game AND a workout So me being a very loyal Amazon fan who buys everything from Amazon decided to purchase it It arrived on time My child was VERY thrilled to play it To my whole family s dissapointment the EYE TOY CAMERA that was sent with the game was apparently broken Ok Amazon I would rather you keep your Eye Toy Camera that s broken until you can send us the whole package that actually works Later my whole family played this game at the neighbors house Extremely fun when the camera actually works Replacement camera should be here soon Very furious at Amazon 
GREAT WORKOUT In case your new to the ps2 eye toy It is one cool toy THis is the perfect entry into the eye toy market as well Kenetic is lots of fun and you get a great workout Best of all you get feedback as to how well you are doing I am talking stats as to how well you performed today and relative to other outings All in all it is a great purchase The camera is placed on top of your tv and then projects your image onto the screen Throughout the game you have to do various tasks with your body to move objects around on the screen This is worth it if you are looking for a solid title for the eye toy or if you are just looking for a great workout 
The real NFL Let me begin by saying this is NOT a game for children What makes this game unique and separates it from the Madden series is the training camp option Train your players use steroids and x ray those bone crushing injuries Overall a pretty good sports game 
The best game ever This is the best game ever If you want to play with your love ones this is the best game to have with You can be addicted to it sometimes but that s a good sign for a good gam 
Best at multiplayer mode Being an easy game in championship mode the best is when played in multiplayer mode Hours and hours of fun playing against friends and family A must have 
Mario s back and he s brought some freinds Mario Kart Double Dash is essentially Mario Kart 64 and then some The game brings alot of new cards to the table which I will review below Mario Kart Double Dash has improved on the last game immensely and that is saying alot because Mario Kart 64 was one of the most fun games available for the N64 The first way it improved on the previous game was allowing players to choose 2 characters to race with instead of 1 This makes for a bit more of a complex control scheme but otherwise doubles the fun The game also features tons of available characters to play as Mario Luigi Peach Daisy Wario Walluigi Bowser Baby Bowser Koopa Paratroopa Baby Mario Baby Luigi Donkey Kong Diddy Kong Yoshi and Birdo The game has the ol Grand Prix mode and the Time Trials but it also has some new unlockable features such as New carts New characters A new circuit New battle mode stages and more but I don t want to spoil anything Mario Kart Double Dash s multiplayer modes are better than ever too Not only are battle and versus modes once again available but there are new types of battles shine theif and babomb blast All in all Mario Kart Double Dash is extremely fun and replayable and has enough features and unlockables to keep you occupied and entertained for a while I enjoy it and I think any Gamecube owner should pick this game up I reccomend renting it first to see if you like it and then making your decision Thanks for reading bubba samus 
Keeps Grown Men Busy I play this with my friends We are all grown men We re so pathetic but we don t care When we play we randomize our characters and cars It really makes the game interesting It totally sucks when you get stuck with some losers like Wario and Petey Piranha All Wario does is throw that lame bomb that never hits anyone and Petey Piranha s head is so big that you can t see the road in front of you I prefer Donkey Kong and Toadstool If those two characters ever come up for me the game is over dude Usually I m the champ but the last time we played Ron won But we ll see who takes it next time Anyways go get this game You ll get your money s worth and then some 
Pure Magic All I have to say is that squaresoft out did themselves with X It truly is a masterpiece and a feast for the eyes I was lost in it s story creativity music and charcters Beautiful 
Final Fantasy has done it again I m not going into the storyline becuase it will obivously spoil it for those who haven t had the oppurtunity to play this excellent game Final Fantasy X is the first game in the Final Fantasy Series to be released on the playstation 2 The graphics here are sharp and crisp no fuzzness or distortions Voice actors actually do a good job doesn t sound like those old kung fu movies where the tone of the voices don t match the person s appearnace Battle system is simple to use and they offer tutorials within the menu in case you re still confused I m really pleased with the results and I can see myself playing this game over and over again 
French Connection meets Mario For those who have the time and patience to learn the ins and outs of this it is great realistic racing My favorite part though is going one on one in trying to outrun the cops It is wild and very reminicent of the famous chase scenes from French Connection I and II Playing this way never fails to draw an audience from whoever s in the house at the time and they end up getting wrapped up in it too cheering from the sidelines with enthusiastic advice like Look out Watch out for the road block ahead You ve lost him etc If you re not playing it is still great to watch p s I initially bought this for my son and got hooked watching him play 
The best Need for Speed yet This is definitely a game for racing fans and people who love tuning cars In this game they actually have the exotic cars Porsche Lamborghini which makes it even better They also added cops in this game which they never had in the previous Underground games Now to the game In this game there are alot of cars You can race from the old school muscle cars to a tuned up race car And even the police have nice and fast cars But they can be really tough at times especially the SUVs The Storymode actually kept my interest throughout the whole game unlike the others that were quite boring There is a Blacklist that you must beat in order to become the 1 most wanted In this Blacklist there are 15 experienced Street racers that you must beat in order to get to the top They each have their strengths so it can get quite challenging at times Another cool but at the same time annoying thing is when the cops interfere in the middle of a race and once you beat the race you have to escape them So it s very interesting and fun As for the gameplay it s actually easy to get used to even though it may seem difficult It s also not complicated PS2 version it s mainly like the previous Need for Speeds So you ll learn it like after the first race The graphics are one of the things that caught my attention It s just so smooth and seems real And the videos also seem very realistic and are always fun to watch and can be funny when you get busted by a woman Overall there s not much else to say except go out and buy this game if you love racing games Oh yes and buy the Black edition 
Need for Speed Most Wanted I have been enjoying playing this game Once you get used to the speed brake and the nos button your on your way to mastering this game This defenitly beats Need for Speed2 Hot Persuit 1 I think the game could be better if they had us race at night through the city streets with the buildings aglow like New York or Las Vegas in a couple of the races 2 I am getting my cars pretty fast as I try to win the game my last wish for this game was to bad the roads have to end before you can really see how fast your car can go whether your racing or on free time I always seem to have stop or brake sooner than I d like to as the road curves as the race track keeps going along I am having fun with the game anyways The milestones requirements give the game a nice touch as it adds more fun to the game as you try to accomplish the task and avoid getting your car impounded Good game M O 
NFS Most Wanted NFS Most Wanted is ok but there are a few things I don t like about it The variety of cars is mediocre and the controls are horrible How can you eliminate the old fashioned way of control by using the pad I absolutely hated that The amount of vehicles is horrible only 37 In NFS Hot Pursuit 2 there were close to 50 I am not thrilled with the tuning feature and what s the deal with the NOS The way I see it if you need NOS on your car then your car isn t fast enough I like the police AI that s just incredible and the 3d models of the vehicles are incredible The gameplay is great and the combining of the elements from Hot Pursuit 2 Underground and Underground 2 helps the game but the variety of the cars hinders it 
Great fun Make sure to play it with Force Feedback Wheel I have played many of the NFS series This one and NFS Hot Pursuit 2 are the best To me this game would not be very playable with a regular gamepad I purchased the Logitech Force Feedback Pro wheel and it makes ALL the difference Precise control The game takes on a whole new level of realism You get a much better feel for how the different cars react The game does get progressively harder Getting on the Blacklist is easy getting to number 1 is not Some of the milestones can be ridiculously hard but it is awesome when you finally get past them I do wish I had bought the Black Edition but the regular one was good for hours and hours of fun I would say there is a decent level of replay ability to it too 
Pretty good It s just like the cartoon series My brother 7 yrs old can play this game for hours I play it 18 yrs old and find it enjoyable It gives you something to do on those slow days There are mini missions you have to complete You re given awards and extras to the game after each completion I d say it s 100 hours to complete the whole game I ve done 60 in one day but that could just be me I normally devour any game I get The graphics is great the story is great it s amusing a little too colorful but you get used it 
I m More ED cited This is a really nice game no matter which system you get it for especially if you re a huge fan of the show like me First off this features impressive gameplay with awesome 3 D graphics Heck they ve still got the squiggly outlines right even in 3 D form Next there are some great special features with no needed codes like a feature with the cast members who do the voices of the Eds and the Plank music video You can garner these cool extras by finding chickens in each level Now in this game you play all three Eds in their neverending hijinks for jawbreakers In fact you can find jawbreakers if look real hard in each level There s even a jawbreaker dispenser somewhere in the game but you got to have a certain amount of cash on hand to get them Playing all three of the Ed characters can be tough but quite fun in a way As Ed the one with the eyebrow you can pick up objects and throw them and using the Batter Ed move to smash through walls and stuff As Edd the one with the hat you can use his slingshot to his distant objects to make them fall use his wit to activate machines and use the Trampol Edd move to go a little higher As Eddy take a guess use the El Mongo Stink Bomb to stun your opponents and use The Tower of Eddy move to walk across thin walkways sneak around and grab high items within reach You can even interact with the other characters from the show but watch out for those squirrels There are a couple of bonus levels that seem reminicent of the Eds Halloween special as well as those special features I aforementioned Overall this is game though fairly short in full play is a very nice one Cartoon Network may not have much in video games i e Dexter Mandark s Lab for PS1 Powerpuff Girls Chemical X traction for N64 and PS1 and Cartoon Network Speedway and Block Party for GBA but they seem to have caught up now with this and a new Kids Next Door game I hope you enjoy this as much as I have And one more thing they have seem to released this game just in time for the new ED isodes on TV I m starting to like those as well 
THIS GAME DESERVES AN OSCAR This game is the best I have ever gotten I ve got in Pin The Tail On The Ed But I can t seem to get pass the hard parts Also THIS GAME DESERVES AN OSCAR 
Burnout 3 Takedown I rented this game before I bought and liked it so much I just had too buy it 
Crash N Burn Return It s a great game for 20 putting it simply you race and you wreck everyone thats racing you the game would be more fun if you could customize your own cars but there are only preset cars like in all other racing games the game is a prettey decent length about the only drawback to the game is the music only like 3 good songs like I wanna be Sedated by the Ramones a plus side is you can always turn off the musi 
Great game overall Some room for improvement An addictive game which has kept me up well past midnight If you enjoy maps urban layout planning and patient strategic thinking this is the game for you Don t buy it if you are of the action and adrenalin persuasion It does take plenty of system resources I own a Dell XPS 3 2 GHz machine with 1MB RAM and there are still a few bells and whistles beyond my reach it helps to have a sophisticated video card which I don t The campaign mode is annoying they give you too little money to get started and bad things start happening too quickly However the sandbox scenario mode is a joy to play You can use the scenario editor to fill your treasury to the brim before starting the game and to get rid of all the distracting disasters plagues god s wrath etc that prevent you from doing what is really fun about this game BUILDING A ROMAN CITY You can specify everything which goods to produce from a finite but ample enough menu which buildings to erect where to place them how quickly to grow how much to export import how much to store or consume where to place your plebeians patricians and soldiers etc Of course the city has to run properly and there are things you can t get away with people have to eat don t like living in ugly neighborhoods need access to running water and so on but these restrictions merely imply that you have to ensure functionality and aesthetics which is part of the fun There are several maps to choose from and you can even build your own although here the program shows its weakness the editor is not at all friendly when it comes to map editing and can lead to crashes the first time I tried it I overdid myself and had to reinstall the whole program so beware The key improvements I would recommend have to do with the number of ready made locations offered there are too few only 3 in fact All the other locations are destined for campaign mode play and are therefore not modifiable at all which is a pity 
Great Game So Long As Your System is Up To Scratch Caesar 4 is getting a reputation for being riddled with problems This is unfortunate as the game itself is a fine effort by developers Tilted Mill They have achieved an admirable balance between maintaining elements of the earlier Caesar games and providing something new The improvements are certainly the graphics of the game and also the distribution system Where in C3 you had to make absolutely certain walkers did not have options of which way they could go this no longer matters Still you do need to build in a certain way if you wish for success Like many others I had crashes when first installing the new game The Tilted Mill tech forum were very helpful turned out I needed to install a patch for my Athlon dual core CPU and get all the Windows updates You need up to date drivers and a goodly amount of free space on your hard drive if you want this game to run well That s the way it is like I said its a pity because it will cost this game some sales This game while enjoyable lacks the depth of its predecessor C3 While many played the game few played it really well due to its unravelling complexity The new game seems to have deliberately avoided this sort of a situation and it should be easy for someone familiar with this kind of game to play at a high level fairly quickly The music in this new game by Keith Zizza is worth the price of ammission alone Here is a major improvement from C3 which had quite good music itself There is a map editor included but it is quite difficult to use prone to crashing and doesn t appear to have any help file incorporated It is to be hoped for the longevity of the game that this is addressed It will not have been lost on Tilted Mill Sierra that although C3 was made some eight years ago it is still being played competitively due wholly to the ability of players to produce good custome made scenarios Caesar 4 is a great game You can build truly stunning cities with it more so than any other citybuilder It s a pity this means purchasers may need to do a little bit of system tidying up to get it to work properly 
Almost perfect This is nearly a perfect product if it weren t for two things 1 The black color unfortunately makes any fingerprints on the lid way too noticeable 2 The one thing I don t like about the Lite is the fact that GBA do not fit in this console Nintendo really should ve fixed this Other than that and combined with an M3Player and Passkey is really your best choice 
Nintendo DS Great Entertainment I bought the white one for my 7 year old son but could never tear it away from his hands so I got my own Too bad they haven t invented a calendar appointment software for us big kids The only negative is the white one gets dirty very easily would recommend buying the black instead 
Awesome I love this thing It s awesome The older version of DS was a little clunky and childish looking This thing rocks my socks off It s sleek sexy and portable It s like an iPod of video games You don t have to buy batteries It comes with an extra stylus Its screen is brighter The sound is stereo This thing is super dope It s the freshest thing out there You gotta get one Sell your old DS on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one You ll love it 
Gaming is fun again I just bought the new Nintendo DS lite in onyx and I love it The last handheld gaming system I owned was one of the first gameboys Since then I really didn t care for handhelds My cousin had the nintendo ds I loved it so much I went out and bought the new and improved DS lite So what if it was ten extra dollars It was worth it I was blown away by the graphics and sound I love how sleek and compact it is I love handhelds again I was going on vacation and needed something to do Believe me it gave me a whole lot to do I can t put it down If you buy this nintendo you will love it Thanks 
Great follow up If you loved the original Age of Mythology this is a great followup It would be better if the campaign part was a bit longer but it is still a great fresh addition to this game The addition of the Titans adds a whole new dimension One can only hope that Microsoft will come out with another expansion with Celtic Chinese mythology too 
The Titans A great improvment on an Excellent game Only disappointment is that you can t access the same titans from the campaign in the quick game and that the titans aren t named I think that they should be afterall they are Gods I d also like to see a patch that gives you access the the Norse Giant Hero He was pretty cool But the Roles of the heros are great and The atlantean army is awesome 
It s okay but not as good as expected This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them but I am not one of them The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well but the plot to the campaign messes it all up The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun I was disappointed in the new campaign I d say the first one is better If you make a big deal about graphics though than this game is for you It has excellent graphics and features The ocean and mountain looks so realistic They do a good job showing you underwater These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series If you were expecting a good campaign your not going to be very happy Plot isnt so good and its very short It has about half of the other games campaigns A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out They re kind of annoying Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal Graphics 10 10 Campaign Plot 3 10 Music 6 10 Mythology 9 10 Overall 7 10 
Lots of worlds to play with I bought this memory for my kids since hey were advancing in video playing and weren t able to save their achievements This memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels I think is the best out there 
Best GameCube memory card available Even though it costs the most of the memory cards and might seem over priced this is a wonderful memory card I don t have a huge collection of GCN games because I prefer the PS2 but I remember with older model memory cards I had to delete old saves to make room for newer games With this memory card you can most likely hold saves for every game you own and more space should be left for new games to come The only complaint I have about this memory card is that it only comes in one color and doesn t match any of the GameCubes on the market 
fianly the perfect card It s about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information Before now one had to rely off brand cards such as the Nyko 8 MB for large saves and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves A basic save of Madden MVP Baseball or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card Saving more than that a season or franchise was only possible with off brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted Nintendo brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games this is perfect 
Weapons are nor allowed What makes it special is that it s the first PlayStation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device I gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive PS2 game 2 or 3 hours On the other hand there are several possible endings and a bonus game the game has a nostalgic atmosphere and the graphics are astonishing 
Amazing Non Action Game One of the highest graphical games I have ever seen A very good plot although at times your guy is not too bright Non Action as the title said but not all games need action I agree with spencer ma that a sequal or a related game should come out 
One of the Best Video games This is GREAT VIEDO GAME This is the sequel to Destroy all Humans The Game takes Place 10 years after the first Destroy all Humans so its 1967 the time of Hippies I don t think there that cool and all heck break lose when Crptyo 138 A Pure Furon loses his Mothership when Soviet KGB Agents shoot it down with a Neaclear bomb Pox is kill all he is now is a hologram and you get to go all around the world to destroy Humans THats all for now play it to find out for yourself 
STRONG GAME MORE OF THE SAME This game is alot like Call of Duty 2 The graphics are better than 2 The play is almost the same The online play is where the game thrives The online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game If you love shooters you will love this game 
I Feel Sorry for PC Owners Who Can t Play Call of Duty 3 First of all I am a big World War II fan I love playing all the World War II games that are made for the PC I decided last week I had to get a Xbox 360 just to play Call of Duty 3 and Gears of War So I went to a local Gamestop and bought the Xbox 360 along with Call of Duty 3 Gamestop didn t have Gears of War in yet I ended up getting Gears of War at Circuit City Okay so I went home and I set up the Xbox 360 on my tv set and I put in Call of Duty 3 to play and I noticed the picture wasn t that good So I disconnected the Xbox 360 and I hooked it up to my PC flat screen monitor Boy let me tell you something There was a huge difference in the quality of the picture I couldn t believe it And the sound was 100 times better What is so cool is I can turn on my PC and my Xbox 360 at the same time and switch back and forth playing games from my PC and games from my Xbox 360 on the same PC flat screen monitor This is the best investment I ever made Now my review just has to do with Single Player only Call of Duty 3 looks even better than Call of Duty 2 on the PC flat screen monitor Call of Duty 3 is a great game that should have been made for the PC too The battles are very intense and very realistic The AI is very good Both Allies and German troops advance and retreat when they need to They both use cover very well It is so cool to fight in huge battles and have large number of troops from both sides fighting against each other It is especially cool when you have artillery shells exploding all around you while you are right in the middle of fighting a large battle The graphics are very good Call of Duty 3 has some the best looking grass and best looking water I ve ever seen in a game I really like the storyline in the game This game is based on actual battles fought in France during the summer of 1944 I can t wait for Call of Duty 4 to come out next year I hope it is based on some more World War II campaigns 
another nazi shoot em up and yes its very good I am a huge fan of world war 2 first person shooters I ve been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor since then not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty It was a wonderfual game and still is Call of Duty 2 was even better Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on in a word yes Although it is alot more of the same But then again why mess with a great formula Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around sheer intensity and also alot of fun But then you might say well i ve played COD2 are you saying its the same Yes and No The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense Yea its the same game But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier Honestly these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360 I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score Oh and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more Seriously the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content meaning on the edge of your seat The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest the best that money can buy 
One of the Best DS games out there If you like 2 D side scrolling classic adventure games you ve gotta check this game out I m personally a big fan of 2 D animated sprite games especially now that they re getting more and more rare as they are converting everything to 3D Don t get me wrong I love 3D games too in fact I majored in 3D animation but 2 D games are what I grew up with and this one is definately a winner If you like any of the old or newer castlevania games you will love this game It has everything you ve come to expect and loved about the genre You ll also love it if you re into games like 2 D metroid mario zelda megaman and the like The graphics are amazing in this game and you can tell they spent plenty of time illustrating the subtle graphics and music for this game The backgrounds are gorgeous with rich detail too The game has a good balance of complexity and easy game play It s just complex enough to keep you interested and not overly complicated as to stress you out and spoil the fun This game may be too complex for kids 10 and under though There s lots of dialogue and lots of menu s and submenu s that may be too complex for kids under 10 unless your kid loves RPG games like final fantasy then this would be a breeze Pros Beautiful graphics rich detail fun game play lots of weapons and powers to absorb intuitive game design and menus huge world to explore and interesting big boss creatures did I mention the graphics are awesome Cons The top screen is used only to display map of world seems like they could ve integrated it more with the game Other than that I can t think of anything else Conclusion If you like 2 D or 3 D side scrolling adventure genre this is a must buy This may well be the best adventure game for the DS ever This game is especially hard to put down after you start playing it Was this review helpful Please vote thanks 
You can t go wrong with Dawn of Sorrow Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow is the latest iteration of Konami s decades old franchise and the first to appear on the Nintendo DS Don t let the title fool you this really isn t the dawn of anything except maybe a bunch more Castlevania games on the DS And the subtitle here is simply a workable way to include the letters D and S in the title of the game as seems to be the requirement for the platform at this point Dawn of Sorrow actually takes place a year after the events in Aria of Sorrow which came out in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance If you ve played that game or if you ve played just about any recent Castlevania game actually you ll be right at home with Dawn of Sorrow because it s basically the same game repackaged to fit the DS That isn t a bad thing though because the Castlevania games have long carried the torch for good old fashioned 2D side scrolling gameplay and Dawn of Sorrow keeps that flame burning as bright as ever The star of Dawn of Sorrow is Soma Cruz the young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming the next Dracula in Aria of Sorrow Soma has the ability to collect the souls of monsters he kills thus inheriting their powers A year after Soma escaped Dracula s castle a mysterious woman named Celia shows up and attacks him Celia is a priestess of a new cult that is attempting to resurrect Dracula Since Soma already proved once before that he s capable of foiling the resurrection of the dark lord the cult decides to eliminate him before he can mess up their plans as well Soma survives the attack quite easily and Celia is forced to retreat Apparently Soma doesn t take kindly to people who try to kill him so he sets out to find Celia and prevent her from reviving Dracula The entire game takes place at the cult s base which is a replica of Dracula s castle In true Castlevania form you ll start off relatively weak with only a knife and some mediocre armor As you progress through areas of the castle you ll fight monsters and search the mazelike hallways where you ll gain experience as well as find new and better equipment As you gain experience you ll level up and your stats will increase in attack defense strength constitution intelligence and luck Throughout the game you ll also collect the souls of monsters you kill These souls can be equipped to give Soma new abilities There are three types of souls you can equip as well as ability type souls that grant you special powers without having to equip them Ability souls are collected when you defeat bosses and these abilities are usually required to progress through the game By using these ability souls Soma can learn how to double jump move underwater and break crystal blocks all of which are required to access certain areas of the castle Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow sticks close to the tried and true formula so it will be an instant hit with anyone with an affinity for the sort of explorative gameplay the series is known for While it doesn t do much to distinguish itself as the first Castlevania on the DS the updated look excellent music and added controls help to refine the series even further The bottom line is Whether you re familiar with the series or not you can t go wrong with Dawn of Sorrow 
Classic Castelvania The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania The sidescrolling platform action is spot on the graphics truly push the limits of the DS and the variety of equipment soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play As people have said in past reviews the use of the touch screen feels tacked on To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen which can be frustrating if a you have poor penmenship or b are left handed such as yours truly and have to scramble to take the stylus out switch it to your other hand and draw the symbol It s a neat little addition but again it didn t really need to be there Also the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy even in the later levels Don t get me wrong there are some that are just downright nasty but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go that s it Overall this is another great game for the Nintendo DS With the exception of the clunky touch screen addon the game is overall fantastic 
Nicely Done Konami If you are looking for an adventure game with action graphics and different ways of playing this is the game 
Great Game to Play My son is an avid Castlevania game player I bought this game for his birthday I asked him how he liked the game and these are a few of his comments He likes how it offers the use of the touch screen to shatter blocks that are in the way and also to draw symbols that open doors and help defeat certain boss monsters Some monsters have abilities that you can equip while others can be summoned to help you battle The game provides a good variety of weapons and armor There are hidden items and the challenge of getting all types of monster souls that makes the game more interesting He was planning on buying this game for himself and was very pleased to get it as a gift 
Great Platformer and Intriguing Storyline Castlevania is a series of games involving vampires and side scrolling combat With Dawn of Sorrows Soma Cruz is a teenager who has the soul of Dracula within him A year ago in the game before this one he had to fight off the dark powers within him He won and thought his life would be normal again Unfortunately when this game opens he immediately comes under attack and has to vanquish a new set of foes The game is a pixel based side scroller and involves human figures fighting skeletons werewolves and other monsters The look is definitely old school retro If for example you ran this side by side against Robots another title I reviewed recently the Robots figures were crisp and detailed while the Castlevania characters and screens showed a granularity It s a style difference that many people appreciate You primarily move left and right slashing with your sword throwing bones and performing other styles of attacks to take out your enemies There is some platforming as well jumping up and down ladders to get to new areas This works in well with a storyline so it s not like say Mario where the platforming is all there is to the game For example there s a hunter who has sworn to kill Dracula Soma knows about the hunter and understands that the hunter will have to fight him if he loses control of himself to Dracula They are enemies who have a truce and who both respect each other but who know if circumstances change they will have to lock in combat There are some touch screen aspects to the game You find seals which are in essence patterns of lines To perform certain actions for example to finish off a boss you have to create this seal This involves drawing that pattern perfectly You re allowed to practice but when the time comes if you don t get the seal done just right you could be in great trouble It s a neat idea but I wish it had been something a little less perfectionist oriented I know many people who just can t draw well or who have hands that shake a bit If they d gone with a memorization game or a logic puzzle or something it would be more about real skill intelligence and less about having perfectly steady hands In general I did like the fun action and I did appreciate the RPG and storyline here I got drawn into the story rather quickly I think for the next version I would like to see the graphics kicked up to match the DS capabilities the seal puzzle changed to be less about perfectionist drawing and I d also like some of the dialogue to be less cliche I loved the flow of the plot but winced at several of the comments made by characters Well recommended 
Great Game Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow was the first 2D version of castlevania that I had played in a long time Well to be onest the first one since Castlevania II Belmonts Quest came out on the NES back in the 80 s I never got to play Super Castlevania or the amazing PSX versions which I should have after playing this game and buying the 2 previous GBA games This was an amazing change ot the games for me in the original it was really hard to beat and made you frustrated II fixed it a little and made you search for Dracula s body and then destroy it but was frustrating as you had no real direction and most of the weapons tended to suck This however was an amazing game It eases you into the game you have a lot of HP at your disposal and can regain them take that 1980 s games quite often from potions or from a save point or souls The souls are a great thing and am loving it in the previous game as well They range from you not taking as much damage to growing a tail to shooting lightning or bombs and letting you throw a doll and switch places with it I enjoyed this game and was determined to finish it I don t currently have 100 but on my first time through I got 98 which is nice because I have played games through and you finish with 48 and you completed the entire game The touch screen is not used often in the game but when it is used it is used well You only need it to destroy a few blocks that are in the way and to input magic seals whihc you need to defeat the bosses and get through certain doors It plays great although you can cheat and not have to hit the points perfect as long as your are quick which is a good thing as most people are not perfectionists or if they are are really slow The game is difficult but not overbearing like many of the series have been in the past I loved this game and will play it for a long time even though I have beaten it before I will try Julius mode which is the more traditional difficult castlevania game using a Belmont finally with a whip no souls no potions it will be tough but I will enjoy it greatly If you own a DS you need to own this game 
A pretty good game clearly worth this price It has some flaws you will have to run around a bit between play areas but it plays well enough The price is right and it is worth the time you will spend on it The learning curve is small and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the CD if you look for them a neat extra It has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new though you do have a quot partner quot you can exploint during battle but it is a good change of sceenary I liked it enough to want to finish it I think you will too 
great game If you like Diablo 1 this is exactly the same game only improved 300 percent If not for Blizzards Bnet and all the multiplayer options I would say that this game is also better than Diablo 
Very nice game I m not a big fan of the Diablo D amp D typr game but this game is really neat The one big advantage of this game over Diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game Very high replay value also makes this game a winner Pick up a copy if you can I ve seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store For the price you can t go wrong 
A Great Game completely engaging and challenging FarCry rates as great with my other most memorable gaming titles see below FarCry was a true step forward in visual quality and the intelligence of the adversaries FarCry is great mix of indoor levels and also large outdoor landscapes to travel over A great game really takes you in and you feel like you have been in the game s world after playing for an hour or so Other games I rate as great Unreal Quake II Halflife I and II MDK Descent II Hitman Ghost Recon Splinter Cell Max Payne Deus Ex Myst 
Great gaming experience It s a great game featuring an awesome engine The single player campaign is really good and the multiplayer is ok totally recomended 
This is an Awesome game should be played by WAYYY more people I ve played Half Life 2 and Battlefield 2 and this is more enjoyable for what it is Now for multiplayer BF2 is better by far too For detailed graphics HL 2 is better But for a single player experience with open ended routes to your objectives good graphics engaging AI HUGE open environments different types of opponents guns maps and so on this is a great game I have replayed the whole thing once and many levels many many times I would recommend this over any other first person shooter I ve played For multiplayer BF2 CS or Desert Combat which I think I liked best maybe of those but for stand alone Far Cry I hope Crytek hurries up and makes some new PC game with their engine which blows BF2 out of the water someone should and can even though BF2 is a great game 
Great Great Game I m not a huge FPS fan but every once in a while I need to fulfill my animalistic urges to blow something up and lay waste to others FarCry is a beautiful game topped only by its playability The AI is smart and will sneak around and flank call for backup sound alarms etc instead of just barrleing straight at you A couple of times I ve made the mistake of focusing on one guy or area and had another enemy pop up right in my face from the side The graphics are amazing My comp isn t a beast it s pretty standard by today s means but I have put in a 256MB GeForce graphics card Standing on top of a hill everything miles away is still crystal clear and detailing hasn t diminished at all it s absolutely gorgeous Physics of the game are great and operate realistically Get this game you won t be disappointed 
The best FPS of all time Even though there are several good reviews already here and this game is already a couple of years old I still feel compelled to put my two cents in about my favorite game I ve played a number of other first person shooters but no other game comes even close In fact I have trouble playing other FPS s now because they lack so many of the things that make Far Cry exceptional This game is definitely not for everyone though If you are more interested in shoot em up alien games like Doom or story driven puzzle solving shooters like Half Life then you may not like Far Cry If however you are like me and prefer strategic calculated shooters without too much fluff then Far Cry is definitely the game for you So what makes Far Cry unique On a large scale the graphics level design and balance come to mind I still have not seen a game with better overall graphics The levels are huge and open ended giving you the freedom to plan your approach This gives the game plenty of replayability there are numerous effective strategies for each level as well as enabling each individual player to use his or her own style The game is hard and it uses a checkpoint system so there is little margin for error Normally I d like the option to quicksave but in Far Cry the checkpoint system works very well A quicksave system would ruin the open endedness of the game On the more difficult levels exposing yourself to enemy fire spells rapid death The game is as close to realistic in this regard as any I ve seen Even on the easiest level however Far Cry is no walk in the park The AI is smart and uses strategy It doesn t just rush you blindly unless the odds are in its favor The first level is anything but a tutorial and the action starts quickly The game is long but contrary to what another reviewer said I have never found it to be repetitive and I ve replayed it twice The levels are distinct and each has its unique challenges This brings us to the gameplay what separates Far Cry from every other shooter on the market In may opinion Far Cry is perfect in this aspect of the game First of all vehicles play an important role in the game Unlike in many games if you see something you can use it There are multiple boats trucks a hang glider even a forklift and each has its place and its benefits Then there is the weapons system All of the guns in Far Cry are useful and well balanced You can carry four weapons which again to me is the perfect number Just enough to add variety but not so many as to make the game totally unrealistic or so few that it becomes annoying This brings me to the controls This area is where Far Cry beats out every other FPS in my opinion You come equipped with binoculars which track your enemies and are essential component of gameplay You have a stealth meter so you know when enemies are becoming aware of your movements Instead of just always running you will find yourself stealthily crouching to avoid enemies And last but definitely not least you can crawl I have no idea why this isn t implemented in more games Crawling provides you with the most stealth and steadies your aim considerably Since there are only a few places in the game where you can run in with guns blazing and expect to stay alive crawling is vital to your survival You can lean and fire at the same time I have also never seen these two combined in a game I think all games should have this feature So in conclusion this is by far my favorite shooter and if you like any of the same kinds of things I do then you should buy this game immediately Its only weakness is that it requires a fairly good system to run smoothly and does have a number of large patches If you like exploring beautiful environments spending time planning your approach and making full use of your range of controls on a regular basis then I highly recommend this game It is intricate and very challenging Just writing this review makes me look forward to playing it a fourth time 
Exciting tactical FPS Game I was hearing and reading all the rave over this game and I finally got it myself As you can tell by my giving it a high star rating I really like it so I m a raver now However if you ve not played it but are used to First Person Shooter FPS games you may find this one somewhat unique The main difference between Far Cry and other popular FPS games like the Halo and Doom series is this game is not as fast paced Far Cry requires more sneaking around use of cover diversions etc All in all it requires more of a tactical approach rather than a bust in the room and mow em down with the shotgun approach But still there are certainly intense moments on just about every stage where the action is hot On the technical side This game is very robust and requires an array of strong computing components to run it The install requires 4GB I have a Dell w a 2 6 GHz processor 512 MB of Ram and a 64 MB GEForce 4 MX video card It runs the game no problem but I had to do one little code modification regarding DirectX 9 0 but that was easy I would highly recommend a 128 MB video card so you can run the game on richer graphic settings If you are like me and you prefer using a game pad rather than the keyboard mouse you re out of luck There s just no option for any other method of control However as much as I prefer my Logitech Rumble Pad I ve found that the keyboard mouse is just fine for this game actually the precision of a good mouse is probably preferable So if you haven t got it yet check it out 
My 5 Year Old Boy LOVES This Game My son loves this game We rented it first from Blockbuster and now he won t let us take it back so I ordered it from Amazon com so I can take the game back soon to Blockbuster I have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but I don t mind because it s FUN 
only a 1 player game We rented this game for my kids to play with each other The game is labeled 1 2 players but is made for only one player at a single PS2 console The kids are disappointed because now they have to take turns watching each other Be aware 
Madagascar This was a particularly good game for our younger kids though our 9 year old was able to finish the entire game in a weekend Our 7 year old continues to enjoy it without the same degree of frustration that he experiences with some other games that are a bit too old for him This game was great even though the kids have not seen the movie 
good game I gave this to my nephew and he loves it He has told me the game is great 
Mostly unchanged from the previous year still a solid showing If you ve played one Madden game you ve played them all for the most part at least Madden 07 is almost a carbon copy of Madden 06 This incarnation contains all the essentials Franchise mode all of the NFL teams including all AFC all NFC and NFL europe and historical teams Create your own player fan or team then play single games or entire seasons All the usual Mini Games and Madden Cards are back as well as Online play for those who have the network add on for the PS2 NFL Superstar returns from 06 giving you the opportunity to create a player from a set of random genes or parents which give a wide array of player attributes determining how good your player is and what position he starts at You can also opt to load NCAA 07 Heisman players to continue their illustrious career in the NFL Within superstar you control only your player when he is on the field with the option of controlling or not controlling your team when he is not on the field After several seasons hopefully you ve gained enough statistics and cred to make it into the hall of fame Both franchise and Superstar modes allow for the use of different roles each player can aquire by meeting a certain criteria these roles increase the attributes of your player and other players on your team or decrease the stats of players on the opposing team Some of these stats can be negetive too however such as distracting players or under achievers The control scheme hasn t changed in years The truck stick is now the highlight stick and works pretty much the same way The QB Vision cone is back but this time optional for better or worse The hit stick on defense is less picky this year as moving the stick in any direction will attempt a big hit as opposed to hit sticking in the direction of the ball carrier as in previous games of course your chance for a clean hit is less than your standard diving tackle and the AI seems better at juking this year Playmaker controls and Lead Blocking controls are hangin strong and are extremely useful practically essential on the harder difficulties Before snap audible control has far more depth than previous games allowing audibles in formation plays or just individual routes Playing defense is also a little harder relying on the AI to play as your Defensive Backs will let up 3 4 big plays for TD s every game and on the harder difficulties the AI is just as useless stopping the run I gave this game a 3 because of the apparent lack of effort on EA s part to deliver a reliable product This game lags freezes on some loading screens and is buggy in all sorts of ways The graphics even seem a little choppier Credit this to all the work being done for the 360 and PS3 versions of the game both of wich are leaps and bounds ahead of this generation of madden games In one game I had played at the end of the third quarter with 1 second remaining and ticking away I snapped the ball only to have the ref blow his whistle The game froze for a second the ball was then snapped with 0 00 on the clock and I was allowed to continue playing normally however the 4th quarter never started The game would go on for eternity with 0 00 left in the 3rd quarter Overall it s the same package you come to expect from EA and Madden and probably one of the last we ll see on the current generation of consles which is a good thing in my eyes considering the lack of attention attributed to this game in favor of the new ones The customer should always get what they pay for and at standard retail price EA delivers a game which feels neglected but is still Madden at its core and contains enough of what matters to not collect any dust until 08 
this game is awesome i have been playing the madden series since i was a kid and this game is really good the games just keep getting better and better as each year passes everything in this game is worth the money i strongly reccommend it 
Great in most ways but not worth 40 dollars I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version then dont bother updating as you may not notice many of the updates upgrades Is this an awesome game Yes but it has a few holes even still 1 Too much sacking on your QB by the cpu 2 The CPU will run the ball so darn often it is a joke 3 The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often 4 If you want to play on all madden level you are FORCED to play with QB vision on which we all know stinks Basically they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match ups assignments etc Also the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well What about this game is really good Well it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm it is an easy way to dominate the game BTW the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two now I am making 90 FG s easily You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well The rosters are also accurate but personally if you own madden 06 wait 4 6 more weeks and then buy this one for 19 as a PS2 best of game 
excellent I d recommend this to anyone who has or ever will play a video game in their life I also recommend it to those that never will It s just plain awesome 
Awesome this thing is awesome i recommend the premium however cause the core cause with absolutely nothin 
XBOX 360 Takes Over This system is great for the parent or kid looking for some fun You will save a few dollars if you buy the Core System and then the 20GB hard drive but it is not worth it to get the Core This system that has the hard drive come with the wireless controller which is great to have You can play the Xbox 360 for hours This console is way better than the PS3 in the sense of the price The PS3 has a little better graphics but the cost of the console is outrageous If you are looking for a holiday gift for a teenager or even a college kid the XBOX 360 is the way to go Also if you are planning to buy one from another person online if it seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true XBOX 360 w Hard Drive Pro s Wireless Controller 20GB Hard Drive Ethernet Cable Con s nothing worse XBOX 360 Core Pro s Nothing better Con s Wired Controller No Hard Drive No Ethernet cable Playstation 3 Pro s Little better graphics 60GB Hard Drive available Wireless Controller available Con s Online sucks Overheating possibility All in all the Xbox 360 w 20GB Hard Drive is better than the Xbox 360 Core and the PS3 
Great System Just take the right measures I bought my 360 pro on summer 2006 with it I got Oblivion Ghost Recon NFS Most Wanted and Hitman Blood Money Everything was going great until two months ago it started freezing regularly I didn t pay much attention to it but the week after that I got the three rings of death yup General Hardware Failure I got a little frustrated but I immediately sent an email to Microsoft with my situation They answered within 24 hours and said that the system had to be repaired I was shocked because I don t even live in the US I started calling my local video game stores and none of them were fixing 360s yet After I had called like 5 stores I called a small store in the middle of a residential area and guess what The man told me that his 360 suffered the same problem and that he could fix it I was a little skeptical but anyway I took my system there and left it overnight For my surprise the next morning I got a call from him saying that it was fixed I couldn t believe it I asked him how much he was going to charge and he said Oh Just give me 20 bucks Then he told me that six months ago his 360 had had the same problem and that he had bought both the Pelican Fan Stand and the Nyko intercooler and he hadn t had the problem since The two accessories together both make like 33 dollars and they prevent your console from frying so its absolutely worth it just try to follow the warnings that the people who had bought the two fans have posted because they are very important and could mean the difference between messing your xbox up and letting you play countless hours without overheating The last games I bought were Splinter Cell and Gears of War and now I m able to play 5+ hours without the console even getting warm to the touch of my fingers Yes the system overheats you just have to take the right measures to solve your problems Hope this review helped cheers 
no boys allowed Don t let the screen name fool you I m actually a guy But getting that out of the way I m really into music and I have an Eyetoy so I got Groove It s atmosphere is extremely feminine but this is a great game There are only 23 songs to begin with and a grand total of 5 to unlock Yippie However girls this is a very good party game and guys try it out You ll feel like a pussy but you ll have fun doing it Overall this is a great rythm game but it s in the minor leagues when compared to its awesome competitors like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero 
My girls groove It was a great game that can include your whole family or entertain people at a party Sometimes when you have a lot of people over you can even have a dance party Overall its a great game and I recommend you buy it 
Fun But Needs More Songs Fun game You can actually dance to play once you master the game The only thing I think it needs are more fast dance songs and more innovative dance moves although you can create your own dance chart Otherwise a fun time and the price is right Enjoy 
Have You Hugged a Prinny Today Admittedly I haven t played a lot of strategy RPGs I attempted to play Final Fantasy Tactics generally considered to be a classic of the genre at one point but I found it really dry and I had serious problems with a class system that seems to really unbalance the game by making it too easy I ve never really had much motivation to seek out other examples of SRPG genre because there is Nippon Ichi s Disgaea series as unique as it is fun And long lasting too You can spend several hundred hours playing through Disgaea Hour of Darkness and Disgaea 2 Cursed Memories to beat all the bonus content beyond the main campaign Disgaea 2 shines as being a more polished version of the first Disgaea Character sprites are more vivid spell effects have more visual flare The music and dialogue has a sharper audio quality All the bonus quests from the first Disgaea have been expanded on such as the inclusion of the Dark Court in the endless dungeon of the Item World and even more stuff to do in the Dark Assembly However it is also so similar to the first game that it feels almost like an expansion pack rather than true sequel The story of Disgaea 2 is similar to first one in that it is highly character driven and told with quite a bit of humor Overlord Zenon has tranformed all the residents of the world of Veldime into monsters Adell the last remaining human embacks on a quest to slay the Overlord with Rozalin Zenon s haughty and neglected daughter Along the way they meet a colorful cast of enemies rivals and allies as they attempt to crack the mystery behind the near immortal Zenon It s an enjoyable story if a bit meandering It s one major susprise is a twist at the end that caught me off guard though it probably shouldn t have Combat like most SRPGs takes place on a series of grid like maps usually four to a chapter Characters can move around so many squares per turn and have the opportunity to attack any enemies that falls within their attack range The battlefields are littered with Geo panels multicolored pyramids that confer penalties and bonuses to certain areas of the maps There are dozens of classes both monster and human to fashion a powerful army out of Choose wisely because a grand total of 10 can be deployed at any one time Unfortunately experience points only go to the character that deals the final blow so level disparities between characters combined with a steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary to replay some of maps at times Luckily the difficulty curve is much more finely tuned in this game so you will spend less time leveling up than in the first game The main campaign in Disgaea 2 is pretty short I clocked in a little over 30 hours in my first play through granted I barely touched much of the sidequests I also found it to be a little on the easy side I didn t die once until I was on the penultimate chapter I don t know it that is because the game is easier or if it s just from spending over one hundred hours conquering the first game SPRGs are probably the hardest sub set out of the RPG genre The Disgaea series is highly recommended for experienced and inexperienced players alike Disgaea 2 has many different systems that enhance the playing experience but unlike many games doesn t force the player to learn how to work them all Players have the option of playing the game at face value or learning all the complex systems for a more enriched experience This is a very accessable game and this is a genre that definitely needs more games that strike a balance between being too hard or too easy 
Awesome I bought Disgaea when it first came out and thought it was great Fun funny and with many long hours of game play When 2 came out I was excited It didnt let me down Many features were improved from the first game The assembly is much more wieldy now The item world is more controlled And the battle are more challenging They also removed the ridiculous overpowered character aka angels and majiin that took forever to unlock and only obssesed players get em 
Better than the first Disgaea If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer ninja etc much quicker The main characters are still hilarious and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl Etna and the gang again in this one Go Prism Rangers = Once again the plot isn t too twisted but it is enjoyable Back to the game play though its similar to the old one but you have more options For one you can JOIN the Dark Assembly In the item world you can not only level your item but go to an assembly improve the luck of your item and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence the assembly There is also the new addition of the subpoena These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders too much hp etc etc These are medals of honor in the demon world and allow your characters more prestige not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world Another bonus you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item so you can get a felony charge and level your item at the same time This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer s collection and I highly recommend it Enjoy 
About time After playing Disgaea 1 I tried in vain to satisfy my srpg thirst with every game nipponicchi released afterwards La Pucelle Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom alas not a one compared to the greatness that was Disgaea But it is safe to say that Disgaea 2 is not only as good as Digaea 1 but better The graphics in this one are better the music takes you back to the good old days when rpg music was memorable There have been a few needed tweaks to the battle system here and there However there have also been some additions to Disgaea 2 that some people may or may not like such as the Item World pirates incredibly strong characters that show up randomly in the item world to make life miserable for any unfortunate to cross their path The main characters do not seem as lovable as Laharl Etna and the rest of the Disgaea 1 crew but I guess they ll grow on you after the 200+ or so hours your likely to be spending with them Speaking of which I gotta get back now those very same item pirates have just killed Adell 
Fun Improved great for strategy fans Granted Disgaea 2 won t do much for fans of the Fighting FPS or Action genres but for those who love anime and strategy will have a bundle of fun The battle system is on the outside the same as Disgaea s but there are some interesting and important improvements Here are a few One there is a lift+attack move lifting a character and then attacking like in Makai Kingdoms Two A character who was assigned to attack but was unable to because the target they were going to attack was eliminated by another character before they could attack no longer loses their move Instead they get to move again instead Three guns operate in a significantly different way than bows a problem with Disgaea 1 giving them a great utility Four Speed down Def down and other effects occur more often as a result of weapon usage and are easier to see Five Treasure chests are now a part of battle Six The item bag I m pretty sure is larger Seven Additional battle items are available one of them being cellular phones You ll have to find out what they do Eight Team attacks have become more ridiculous This is a good thing Nine Battle maps are much improved and more interesting The game now has a really spiffy intro hi res and maintains the same irreverent humor of the previous games The quality however is on par with actually better than Disgaea Hour of Darkness Voice acting manages to not be annoying in many cases its very good And it is refreshing to play a good guy again Laharl is obviously in the game he is seen in the character collage art and there are numerous references from La Pucelle Tactics Disgaea Hour of Darkness Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdoms The manual lacks clarity in some places and a lot of the graphics are still very pixely Overall though its hard to beat this game for fun But be warned it takes a LONG time to play 
A Different Perspective on the Final Fantasy Franchise The game was quite fun to play though it has little to really offer in the way of replay value Unless you are a fan of both the Final Fantasy series of games and their elaborate storylines as well as a fan of FPS First Person Shooter types of a games I would probably warn you that this particular offering may not be your cup of tea It is nice to get a bit more of the backstory and continuation of the Final Fantasy VII game one of best overall in the series but the gameplay does sometime get a bit two dimensional and stale All in all it was a short but exciting romp through a familiar world it could have been more but it was okay for what it was 
Not quite what I d hoped for but I m an avid Final Fantasy FF fan When I found out they were making a game devoted to my favorite male character Vincent Valentine I was stoked After pre ordering this game and waiting FOREVER to get it I was expecting the usual action packed fighting and detailed storyline that can be seen in almost all FF games Sadly though I was to be a little disappointed Dirge of Cerberus is a first person shooter just you armed enemies and a lotta guns based on the Final Fantasy VII character Vincent The gameplay s pretty decent with a multitude of different enemies and fast paced gameplay at times The graphics however are a biiiiiiig let down after the initial FMV sequence The guns are pretty basic as far as usage but the equiptment system can be confusing and the materia system is just plain weird at first I m not even going to start on the item limits The game isn t overly difficult or overly easy and offers a few different modes of gameplay easy hard for the unexperienced and veteran players The voice acting is pretty decent and I personally thought the voices matched most characters well Now on to the story Any FF fan should know how much of a let down these last few FF VII sequels have been movie and games They re not bad in the sense of game development or outward beauty but in the sense of storyline Dirge of Cerberus takes the story on a complete tangent Lucrecia and Vincent s past is given in a series of cut scenes and chance encounters while new completely out of the blue characters come to make difficult the process of finding out Vincent s dark history Though it has the casual flare of any FF storyline it more so resembles the two FF movies in its science fiction wannabe horror elements Old characters are brought back new frustrations are raised with hinted love interests and nothing can ever seem to go right on the planet once again Overall this game isn t bad It isn t great but it isn t bad Avid very avid fans of the series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened though they should watch carefully for the things that didn t match the first game If you re a player new to the series play FF VII first or you won t get the full impact of the game If you don t really care and are just checking this out for the heck of it don t buy it Your money is better spent on a good first person shooter like Metal Gear Solid 
Not much new here but great gameplay I originally put off playing this game because I feared that it would ruin the integrity of FFVII for me i also had heard many bad reviews from all over the place about it However i found it was a very fun game At first i had a few gripes about the camera and the voices It s clumsy unfocused and generally all over the place an some of the voices are just wrong but luckily Vincent s is okay However the story was engaging enough that I adjusted to the camera after a while While it s pretty much like every other shooter you shoot things run around get items and shoot things some more it has some familliar and interesting things that sets it aside First it fills in some things about Vincents story in FFVII that people may recall Then there are the familliar settings One of these settings which completely freaked me out is a burned out version of the shinra building Another good thing is the use of materia It can be equipped with weapons and used And then there are the returning characters which it is always an enjoyment to see The gameplay is fast and chaotic but in a fun way And there s even a special boss at the end Overall a pretty fun game 
Good game I got this for my son for Christmas We all have played and enjoyed it My son just loves it 
Incredible fun Just got this game for christmas excellent graphics and such lots of fun feels like the movie The only thing I don t like is that I get frustrated when I get stuck somewhere I m anxious to go on and see what else this game has in store I recommend this game 
Surprise surprise a game as good as the movie I had rented the game for a week and enjoyed it greatly Fluid animation and great sound gave the plot and levels the firepower to stay true to the movie The boss s were a bit predictable however I saw nothing but a solid game Recommend for the whole family 
Gradius meets Pokemon Those looking for a fast paced side scrolling shooter will not be disappointed Those who value their free time away from video games should look elsewhere R Type Final offers a rewarding shooter experience provided you challenge it on Human normal difficulty or higher It s hardly worth playing on the lower settings due to a lack of any real challenge This game offers 101 different ships you can play with Unlocking them is both rewarding and aggrivating Everytime you unlock a high powered ship you ll enjoy exploring its capabilities in battle However the novelty only lasts for one play through at most On the other hand the flight time you have to log with a particular ship to unlock new ones can be truly absurd Sometimes you have to log over TWO FULL HOURS of flight time in a ship to unlock a new one The battle mode is interesting and challenging in its own way though I honestly would have preferred the inclusion of a two player mode While R Type Final is by no means perfect it s a rewarding experience for those looking to relieve the heyday of side scrolling shooters Just anticipate loosing many many hours of your life to unlocking new ships 
Great game If your tired of all the first person shooters and RPGS This game rocks It was 1990 all over again for me Love the game Since i didnt have anm original playstation I can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me The only issue I have is that you cant play 2 player But i can forgive that 
Great Shooter Great shooter game Great graphics 100+ ship variation This game is five dollars at Toys R Us 
R Type Final I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters so take this opinion with that in mind The only problem with R Type is that dying sucks When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups Once you unlock free play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc However overall I think it s the best of the R types and one of the better side scrollers out there 
AWESOME GAME MECHANICS Other than r type for SNES I ve never really played muuch else in terms of the series However I m glad to say that I purchased this one for PS2 Graphics and control aside I think it s the game mechanics which make this such a fun game The basics from the original are essentially the same you fly a ship around blastng your way through hordes of enemies in an endless assault of lasers and obstacles However what set this baby apart from the rest is your weapon system You have an attachable bit on the front of your ship which can be released allowing you to place it on the front or back of your ship or just let it roam about This means you can fire behind you Pretty cool Plus the bit itself absorbs most bullets so it can be used as a shield which after absorbing enough energy allows you to unleash a large explosing type shot Coupled with charged shots customizable bits and missiles there s a lot of room for technique Plus there are 101 different ships you can you use each with their own weapons systems and bit and missile selections which can be surprisingly unique so you won t run into problems of redundancy Other than the difficulty and sometimes slow pacing of the game not to mention the slow down issue at times this is a must buy for all shooter fans highly recommended 
A Delight A challenging game with hundred of ships several hidden bonus levels several endings several levels of difficulty a new versus mode great gameplay excellent graphics and a decent soundtrack This one is a worthy sequel to R Type Delta for the PS1 and it also holds its own against Square s classic Einhander 
Fun but where s the beef Cooking Mama is esentially a series of cooking mini games strung together to form recipes for dishes It s an enjoyable game but it lacks enough depth to be truely replayable When enjoyed casually I think this game could last a while but aside from these dishes there is little else to do I found myself wanting to unlock more than recipes to find new ways of using my cooking practice One way this game could have easily been made a classic would have been to add some competitive play to it How about Iron Chef matches or Wi Fi tournaments But there s not much to this game once the novelty wears off which for me was about 6 hours later I ve come back to it casually but not for more than a few minutes here and there It is however well worth the 20 price tag 
Kitchen Madness I won t say that Cooking Mama is the best game I ve played in recent months Surely there s something more important than cooking like killing zombies on the X360 for example However it s certainly the most innovative especially when you consider how much you can do on the limited dimensions of a Nintendo DS touch screen In Cooking Mama you re an apprentice in the fine art of cuisine management Your master a certain Mama will put you through a series of saliva inducing recipes and will grill you through the preparation of each as if it s the only thing you live for You can choose to practise before hand but when you go into the actual process of making a particular food you ll find that there s no room for error A wrong move and Mama will not hesitate to show you her wrath Making a food involves several steps Some are short while some may take forever For example when preparing a pan fried fish you ll have to go through the coating of the fish slices the melting of the butter the actual pan frying and the arranging of the plate Each process in turn involves different ways of doing things Coating the fish slices for example requires you to drag your stylus in a left right manner while touching the fish Melting the butter requires you to rapidly drag the butter in a circular motion when it s on a hot plate Pan frying involves a following the command on screen mini game that requires you to perform whatever Mama tells you to and so on The impressive thing here is that even though you re just stroking your stylus throughout the game s 70+ recipes you re essentially doing different things It s a bit like Trauma Centre from last year but instead of seeing body parts you re looking at food If you re more adventurous you can even combine recipes to form new ones which adds depth to the gameplay For a game as quirky as this it s understandable that it uses quirky graphics The presentation of Cooking Mama is light hearted and makes the hectic process of cooking to me at least much more enjoyable The music is a little weak even though it does have some nice variety But seriously graphics and audios are not what you d buy this game for I mean who cares about these things when you ve Fried Octopus Balls to make For its sheer audacity in bringing the kitchen onto the DS I d recommend Cooking Mama to every owner of the DS Don t expect to see your DS in a few weeks however if you bought this game and have a missus in the house Now if only my wife can learn a few tips out of this 
A must have football game I m 36 years old and I have played many football video games on many different consoles over the years and I must say that this game stands out above all of the rest There are a zillion college teams to choose from The stadiums are beautifully detailed The players coaches and referee models and their animations are superb When playing in a stadium with a natural grass surface your players get grass and mud stains on their uniforms A friend of mine at my workplace that has had this game longer than I have says that occasionally a player s helmet will fly off after a big hit I have yet to see it happen but I m looking forward to it The crowds look and sound truly alive The fans celebrate and hold up signs The cheerleaders and even the teams mascot look fantastically detailed and their celebrations are exciting The ESPN College Gameday crew Brad Nessler Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit provide interesting and funny in game commentary with some but not much repetitiveness It s pretty cool when Corso makes his winning pick in the Gameday booth before the game he will be wearing either his picks mascot head or the teams football helmet as he s speaking Overall the gameplay is great and the learning curve is fairly easy especially if you re familiar with the Madden series On NCAA 2006 you can adjust your game settings etc any way you like and reset them to the default with the touch of a button I m not much into all of the different options that many sports games have such as creating teams players playbooks making coaching decisions and such although you can do all of that on this game I play solely for the visual and atmospheric stimulation which this game in particular provides In my opinion NCAA Football 2006 blows other football titles out of the water as it is the TOTAL PACKAGE Football fans GET THIS GAME You will feel like you are involved in an actual college football game complete with all of the emotion and pageantry You will become addicted to it and you will want to play it over and over again 
Great Game I had never purchased an NCAA football game until this one and I must say that I am happy that I did I love the college feel that it brings to the table Playing the Texas and Ohio State game in the Horseshoe with the crowd going nuts and the screen shaking was awesome I see that a lot of people are complaining about the fact that throwing long passes is just too easy but I have to ask if anyone ever watches college football on Saturdays This is exactly what happens week in and week out in college football Reason being is that there are more than twice as many talented wide outs than there are corners in college football and I feel that that is accurately portrayed in this game I don t have any gripes with this game except for the fact that in the rush for the heisman mode you are the automatic starter no matter what program you go to and you don t have the ability to change the depth charts except for when the game is about to start and you have to do this before every game All in all this is a great game and because of it my Madden 06 disc is collecting dust on my entertainment center 
Great Game I purchased this game for my son and he loves it He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars I m glad that we selected this game for him he also has Underground Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also 
Sony Playstation 2 Dualshock Controller Blue This controller is very nice and probably the best It works with big and small hands it feals non greasy unless you have greasy hands it has a nice vibration if you notice on some of the other controllers the vibration is too big Now I own a PlayStation 2 and i have played with a lot of other controllers but they dont last the buttons get pushed in the analog is too sensitive etc Although with this controler ive had it for 2 years and it has yet to break on me and people this is a sensitive object dont slam it it will work well as long as you take care of it Also the button reaction on this is the quickest I have seen with those big bulky ones the reaction is very bad and sometimes the analogs dont work properly You may have also seen this controller in black and teal there all the same price and all have the same durability the only differene is the color I rate this item 5 stars because its the best controller out there 
it s a controller In case you havent noticed this is a controller not a game So as far as the controller goes it works great and I have not had a single problem with it 
Great pad but Start and Select should ve been moved up a lil Playstation s Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it and they usually don t do a very good job Their d pads are always too awkward or their construction is too lightweight The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last I m an emulation gamer and thanks to SmartJoy s USB adapter I can use a real PS1 PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem My only gripes with the pad A The Start Select buttons really should ve been moved up after the addition of analog sticks I m always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select B While the d pad is very sturdy it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows 
always get the original 3rd party controllers tend to suck so buy this one instead It s light weight comfortable symmetrical great for fighting games an rather durable Plus the blue color is a rather good thing If you already own four working controllers there s no need to get this thing but if you don t I d recomend a pickup 
Perfect Blue Anybody out there with a controller hog who perhaps gets your controller sticky or messy or does something to it you don t even want to know about Different colored controllers are the key to solving this problem Mr Messy has his and you have yours It works out awesome I love my teal green controller and he loves his blue one You also get a year warranty which comes in the box with this controller in between the yellow cardboard so if there is a problem with in a year they will fix your controller Anyway it is the same size as the ones that come with your original PS2 The buttons are the same they move the same and feel the same The only difference is the color but still it s worth it to get a nice new non sticky controller and to get your self some distance from that controller hog I love this one they also make a teal colored one and I have seen a sponge bob controller out there as well but if its not made by Sony its probably not that reliable Stick with the best get a Sony controller and get in the game 
Not just for kids Comfortable w a few glitches I will firstly say that I am not in the pre teen average age range for GameCube but I still like this controller When I first saw it I thought it would be too small for my hands and that the button placement looked awkward I couldn t have been more wrong The controller fits comfortably even into my larger than average hands For XBOX I prefer the bigger older controller to the smaller Controller S and all of the buttons are within easy reach The controller is set up in a way that the controlls are very instinctive for most games It also allows you to roll your thumb from button to button allowing for smoother gameplay than on systems where you have to lift your thumb and press the buttons The R and L shoulder buttons on the controller are sensitive to the degree that they are being pushed allowing more versatile controlls than on PS2 for shooters racing games and a few others The control stick is comfortable and precise The C Stick is usually superb but in a few third party games I have found it awkward Because it is not the same size and shape as most control sticks it can be awkward using it as one The C Stick however performs admirably in Madden where I find it to be preferable to the XBOX and PS2 controllers The only quality issue that I have found with Gamecube is with the C Stick If you tend to slam your controllers on the ground or leave them to be sat on etc the C Stick sometimes breaks so that the system thinks that you are always pushing it upwards Overall a very comfortable and easy to use controller High quality manufacturing with one glitch 
trust nintendo brand good and comfortable controller better than the N64 ones were It works much better than a 3rd party controller such as madcatz If you plan to or have played super smash brothers melee great game you will notice how much easier it is to pull off moves with a nintendo brand controller It is worth the extra money no matter what it says on the third party company s package dont be fooled by a third party controllers extra button the M button it does nothing because a nintendo brand controller doesnt have one and developers design games according to nintendo brand controllers I never use my cheap madcatz controller madcatz controller often malfunctions as well this one is much better and black goes with everything My rule of thumb Nintendo brand game accessories are more reliable longer lasting eye appealing and overall better than third party distributers please vote yes if I helped 
GameCube Controller GameCube Controller Jet Black I have use the Controller and it is ok I got it for the grandson to use and he is having fun with it 
Because you don t want to make your friends sick When I first went shopping for a second controller for my GameCube I admit I was looking for one that matched my Platinum Edition controller I couldn t find one that wasn t a Wavebird nothing wrong with a Wavebird the wireless controller that I know of but I was just too cheap to spend the extra 10 So I bought a black controller to match my TV Now that I think about it buying a different controller was a smart thing to do Why didn t I plan on that in the first place I spent part of the winter battling a cold or the flu at various times and I can t underestimate the importance of controlling the spread of viruses and bacteria Having different colored controllers makes it easier to remember which controller I ve been using in between nose blowing sessions When a housemate or friend wants to play GameCube as I lay suffering on the other couch I am able to croak out the words use the black one today Trust me I also have a phobia against third party hardware so it s good of Nintendo not to mention profitable for Nintendo to sell spare parts The most important things about a controller are does it fit comfortably in your hand and are the buttons easy to find and use The only thing I don t like is the placement of the Z button The cord is plenty long and the buttons are responsive enough I also like that they re color coded 
original will always work the best This is a great controller and it rumbles unlike the wireless one Yeah it WILL wear down with time but it is by far one of the better controllers because it doesn t ruin your GameCube and it s more durable that third party ones AKA those NOT liscenced by Nintendo I first had a third party GCN controller and for some reason it stopped my GameCube from reading discs I had to get it repaired If anything if you want a good controller don t go for third party stuff Go for the original like this as for one they last MUCH longer and two they don t ruin your hardware It may look plain but it would be better to have a plain working controller rather than a quickly defective pretty one Also the official wireless if good if you don t mind the lack of a rumble 
misunderstood This controller is great Nice feel and all But it does tend to move to one side on its own Many people think it is the controller but if you read in the manual it clearly states that when the gamecube is turned on with the joystick to one side that will be the base for the controller This can be fixed by simultaneously holding Y+X+START Great controller for an easy 5 stars 
Quality Why mess with the original There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount You get what you pay for I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won t have to learn a completely new system 
Ah the DS I can still remember that Christmas morning when I was the happiest kid in the neighberhood first taking out my sleek shiny DS from the wrap of the box all clean shiny and new I remember first turning it on and watching it light up the intro screen making that sastisfying noise Ah the memories It was probally the best expirence with a new console even when I got my PSP on the very first day it came out Surely getting a new console is a joy Okay so this thing may not be as good as the DS Lite After all after getting your hands on the DS Lite it s hard going back to the first one I remember playing it too it was a joy and the stylus worked great Also this was a highly anticipated system second only to the PSP those two months were HELL for me ANyway the games for DS always were showing stregth While the racing games arent as good the DS offers game that you can get nowhere else IT has alot of killer exclusives from Brain Age to Castlevania to a brand new Zelda game to an updated 2 d scrolling classic The DS s touch screen isn t a gimmick if you use it right Sure there may be bad racing games but hey all those quirky games give this system alot of life The DS sadly isn t my favorite handheld b ut I give props to Nintendo for constantly pushing the envelope and giving us a one of a kind gaming expirence The DS will go down in gaming history for sure Bravo Nintendo 
Great portable game system My friend gave me his old DS when he bought a DS Lite This is a versatile system that can play both DS and Gameboy Advance games The touch screen feature is very nice While it cannot play UMD movies like a PSP a portable DVD player is better for that aspect This is worth buying for a kid or adult gamer 
Outstanding The Nintendo DS is outstanding It makes playing games and communicating a breeze 
brain age I am using brainage game with this Very challenging and I have improved my performance 
Pretty good For roughly 30 bones this product is really good My only gripe is that the button text wears off Other than that it is absolutely great especially if the 360 is the center of your entertainment

fit my need perfectly lighted keys and ability to program to turn on my tv made this remote a perfect choice for me a must have for users who dont have a remote and watch dvd s on the xbox 360 
Essential for Media Center Extender functions I have more than 500 albums in my music collection including more than 650 artists While this is not the largest collection my friends have even much larger ones I find it extremely uncomfortable to locate a specific artist or album by using the regular game controller Even while using the limited edition media controller you would spend a lot of time locating specific media That s why I find extremely useful the alphanumerical keypad included in this control and it s also useful when changing TV channels Price is not high and it s well designed Highly recommended for MCX users 
Extremely fun mini games Overall this is a very fun game Initially I was disappointed that Wario Ware was not a launch title but this game gives you everything Wario Ware does and more There are a variety of fun and challenging mini games THe first person shooter games are hilarious Definitely worth picking up 
What a fun family game I haven t played video games for a very long time I have a PS2 that I used primarily for playing dvds I was so excited to get the Wii because I wanted something my whole family could play including my 3 1 2 year old daughter The mini games got us all hooked I had my daughter help when I couldn t do it my first time She would help me shake the nunchuk to help close the door on the bunnies using the bathroom She would dance along with the music in the rhythm test and when we passed a test she would say You win I even got my husband to participate when my arms were too tired to shake and control the wii remote and nunchuks The game is lots of fun and something that the whole family can enjoy 
Bunny s Dont Dissapoint This game is simply amazing The mini games are addictive and hilarious This was my first game for the wii and its been sitting patiently next to me FOREVER really only 1 day If you are a fan of comedy adventures if there were ever any before you have GOT to pick this game up Its not a quick fix this game will keep you busy for a great while Its simply hilarious and fun to play simple as that The life is extended through multiplayer Deffiantly Buy this Game It will own you AaarrrghhhhhH 
Final Fantasy IV Advance Leave it to me to start into a series in its second third or fourth installments In this case it s the fourth Course there s a good explanation why I set out looking for Final Fantasy I II Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance Hey if you re going to collect a series it s a good thing to start at the beginning at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead There isn t much that I can say that hasn t already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance The story goes like this The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals The commander of its air force Cecil has been dismissed after questioning the king s motives With the help of others Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and in the meantime uncovers a far more dangerous one It s a deep story with alot of twists and turns is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system I can t recommend this game enough It s one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy games Although they tweaked the graphics translation and whatnot abit they pretty much made the game as it was originally I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one 
In addition Since there are already several well written reviews already posted I just wanted to add one huge thing that they ve failed to mention This new version has an option for you to select and swap out different players in your party This has never been available in any other version Much like Final Fantasy III ff6 in Japan where you comprised your team from a pool of characters Final Fantasy IV Advance lets you take Palom Poram Cid Yang to fight on the moon if you d like There s also a new dungeon Cave of Trials in Mt Ordeals that requires you to take each of those characters to face a boss in order to unlock their powerful end game weapons Each of these weapons specific to each character I E you can t equip Rydia with Palom s dagger even though they re both black mages is ultra powerful and instantly makes them a worthy addition to your party especially Yang s well maybe not Edward lol Anyway I m sure that the vast majority of you who buy this game have played a previous versions and let me tell you that you will not be dissappointed New fight scene magic graphics better music reworked dialogue unique to this version and new areas will make you feel like you re playing a classic for the first time PS Playing this on the DS Lit 
Pleasantly Surprised There are numerous trends in the video gaming industry nowadays Those developers sure have become sophisticated One of the tactics has been to release classic games on their consoles and see if they can re milk the market This of course has come with mixed reviews and mixed successes Final Fantasy IV for the Game Boy Advance is a champion game Compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES version FF2 I believe this re make is slightly better due to the increased updated features of the game SquareSoft retooled some aspects of the game and added some nice features to please the classic RPG enthusiasts as well as the diehard Final Fantasy fans I like to think of FF4GBA as the upgraded version to the original program similar to downloading a patch for a PC game only of course it still remains a console game The major stand out benefit I gathered from this version of the game is that now the gameplay flows smoother into the Final Fantasy III version FF6 for you diehards that know the Japanese nomenclature That is the switching of the party members that was introduced in FF3 Also the unlocking feature where optional side quests result in more loot The last part of this review deals with the most important topic the cost benefit analysis The question is Do you want to enroll in this common tactic of the video gaming industry Is 30 worth the SNES FF2 patch Does having the portable version of the game albeit a great game meet your desires Probably for most of us we got rid of our old NES and SNES a long time ago I didn t they are right next to my N64 and GameCube A lot of us downloaded emulators a while back and now play these games on our PCs And I would venture to say that almost all of us who love RPGs don t even care about video game consoles anymore and have gone to PC more features in our games So my recommendation here is leave your impulses behind Yes Final Fantasy II and the FF4 GBA version are classic great wonderful games But nostalgia shouldn t cost this much or require special circumstances to be taken advantage of in my opinion Buy the game if you are a collector or have money to burn But always remember they can t take our memories away 
After 15 Years Bards are Still Spoony Here is a blast of nostalgia for your Gameboy Advance Final Fantasy IV Advance aka Final Fantasy II aka Final Fantasy IV Hard Type is a treat for old school RPG players Back in its hayday Final Fantasy IV was the gold standard for what an RPG should be The first in a series of remakes of that wonderful streak that was the SNES Final Fantasies Final Fantasy IV is back and better than ever The story is as good as it ever was Final Fantasy 4 did what Final Fantasy 2 Japanese numbering tried to do mixed a well developed story with memorable characters with good if simple gameplay This is the story of Cecil the Dark Knight who renounces his loyalty to the corrupt kingdom of Baron Baron has been making war against the other nations of the world to capture four elemental crystals When his king commands him to kill the innocent Cecil sets out on a quest to make things right that will take him around the world to the center of the earth and to the moon As he unravels the mystery of who is really behind the actions of Baron he is joined by a cast of over ten playable characters Each of them has a reason to join the fight Characterization may not seem much by today s standards but this game was made in an age when Square believed less was more You revealed a motive once and then you moved on instead of going over and over the same psychological problem again and again Unlike the Playstation port that had absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script FF4Advance has a few minor visual tweaks Some of the game sprites seem to have been tweaked abit to have more definition and character portraits have been redrawn and put in the dialogue boxes to indicate who is speaking Most of the new portraits are fairly close to the old ones Edge s and Rydia s are actually an improvement but the new one s for Rosa Paladin Cecil and Edward in particular aren t so nice to look at There are also two new dungeons and the ability to tackle the final boss with any of the other still living playable characters than with the fixed party of five like in the original All of these new features are very unobtrusive so you can take advantage of them if you d like the extra challenge or ignore them altogether Instead of using the script from the original release that contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes and was censored due to Nintendo of America s then extremely strict guidelines FF4A contains a more accurate revamped version Of course the You spoony bard line has thankfully been left intact It s a classic If not for one issue I d say that this is undoubtedly the best version of the game available Final Fantasy IV was a really hard game FF4A is not that hard at all at least early in the game I don t know if the difficulty was scaled back because they thought that people didn t want to waste GBA battery life on hours of leveling up or because I ve played this game many times before but it just seemed too easy Anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember at least super tough boss battle be it Baigan the Magnus Sisters Evil Wall or something else This time through they where like a cake walk Also it seems that the Active Time Battle is set up in such a way as it gives your party the advantage Your party seems to regain their turns twice as fast as the enemy About half way through the game that legendary difficulty starts creeping back and by the final trek to the core of the moon you ll be thankful for any break the game will give you Final Fantasy IV shows in this port that it stands the test of time Instead of feeling hoary old and outdated it feels just as much fun as it was fifteen years ago 
Even better than the original I just bought this game last month and have played all the way through it including the unlockable side quests I m not going to write much about the games story here there are plenty of other reviews for that already All I m going to write about is the game itself Anyway after playing all the way through the game I have to say that I like it even more than the original The script is much better and the music sounds much better on the GBA One thing that I particularly liked about this game was all of the new unlockables After beating the game you unlock a new dungeon to explore as well as a really cool music player If you go down to extra and select Music Player in the main menu you can listen to all of the tunes and melodies that you heard throughout the game My personal favorites include Hey Cid Rydia Theme of love Chocobo chocobo and Dancing Calcobrena The unlockable dungeon Lunar ruins is very cool To fully unlock every room in the dungeon you have to beat Zeromus once as each character After that you get to do some really cool extra tasks as each character I wont spoil them for you but just having them in the game highly increases the overall replay value of this game Now for the pros cons of this remake Pros It s the same old game that you used to love but with some cool upgrades and additions to game play New Quick Save feature allows you to save inside of dugeons and towns Some of the text from the old game has been fixed so now all of the magic spells aren t abreviated Example Meteo has been fixed to read Meteor Has new unlockable Music Player and side quest dungeon The music sounds much sharper on the GBA you can really hear the seperate instruments playing in unison This version has the old unedited script which is far more convincing durring game play Cons Unlike Final Fantasy Chronicles this game does not include Chrono Trigger They changed the sound effects for some of the moves and changed the names of some of the moves For example Meteor doesnt make that screechy noise anymore which I thought sounded cool and Nuke has been changed to Flare In battle there seems to be a lag in reaction time when pressing down the buttons You press the button but it takes a second to register the command 50 50 None of the graphics have been upgraded but if you re like me that doesnt really matter If you re like me and have already played Final Fantasy II for the snes or Final Fantasy Chronicles for the PSone buy this game It s well worth the price 
Older Game Better Than Any Newer Game Out There Counter strike Oh yes the pc game that seems like it was released 15 years ago is still the 1 online game in the world Thousands of people can write reviews on this game all having different opinions and views of the game But shall we look at the obvious for a minute After 5 years after the game was released Counter Strike is still the most played online game withstanding the ultimate test the test of time What other test of greatness can Counter Strike achieve Millions of people still play this outdated game opposed to the newest more advanced games To me that is a sign of perfection an achivement worth reconizing I am tired of people putting down Counter Strike The Graphics are bad the realism is overrated ect The game is older Accept the game for what it is It is still an awesome game that everyone should play and support So many times people simply look at the graphics of a game to make reviews or opinions on the game What ever happened to the most important aspect of games gameplay Counter strike has the best gameplay of any game ever made Period Newer games may hands down beat Counter Strike in graphics but will never even come close to the gameplay that the original Counter Stike has Its a truely incredible pc game I ve played the original Counter Strike since its beta Hours upon hours I have spent on this game and no other game will ever match the ultimate enjoyment of gaming than that of Counter Strike I still find myself after all these years in awe of the game Trust me I ve played Counter Strike Source Doom III Battlefield 1942 Call of Duty and Half Life 2 and I choose counter strike 1 6 over all of them any day of the week 
It really is the best game ever made In the April 2005 PC Gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time Half Life was 1 This is basically a sequel to that game VERY fun except when you re in a server with hackers in it Just make sure to never give your CD key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it For version 1 6 Then go to Browse games and register your CD key Once you do that you won t be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years 
hours of fun My 8 and 10 year old LOVE this I highly recommed it to anyone It helps teach kids how to sing with pitches and tones The kids love to dress up their characters Even the boys in the neighborhood get invovled I see this lasting for years to come 
GREAT FUN but limited This game is very fun because you are able to change and or create your own characters in many different ways there s different games you can play than just plain karaoke and it has ways of encouraging you to do better Each location you can choose from has fun things that happen when you sing more in tune like if you sing on the rooftop of a building and you re doing AWESOME a helicopter comes by and starts filming you on live cam It s a lot like American Idol in how you re glamourized The only thing I don t like about it is that the song choice is limited There s ways you can earn new songs by doing well but I wish there was a way you could add more songs to the songlist that we personally could choose 
This game ROCKS Santa brought this game and I don t think we ve stopped playing since It is such a blast and really brings the family together We were all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum on Brick House it was our last one left that wasn t platinum the other day It has a great variety of songs new and old Another reviewer said there weren t enough new songs and I disagree My friends daughters 21 and 16 even commented on how many new ones there were but they still chose to sing Take On Me from the 80 s My 8 year old and my husband have gotten perfect scores on Material Girl In fact my daughter loves all the old 80 s tunes The only problem we ve had with this game is that the arrows don t show up for the dancing We don t have a mat but we tried it at someone else s house Anyway I m sure we ll get that squared away by the time we get a mat I cannot recommend this game enough Don t get the headset the regular mics are better be sure to get two for duets 
The Best Yet I don t know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough We plugged it in on Christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since The selection of songs is excellent The sing and dance feature brings sends this game WAY out in front of earlier editions which we also have The eye toy is a good addition Just everything about it is first rate I can t think of a single drawback My only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family PARENTS TOO 
0 This game was a new experience for me i didn t think i would like it but i did i like the story telling and it keeps you interested overall interesting fun and it will entertain you 
Fable An incredible game it has very in depth graphics and a great story line The beauty of the game is that there is a lot of freedom in character development You can choose to be good or evil depending on every action you take The game was a little too short but the gameplay and graphics make up for it This is a must buy for anybody with an xbox 
A truly unique game I really really enjoyed this game It was the only game I played for almost 2 months I was so hooked on it My only criticism is that the missions are too rigid so the outcomes are very much the same during re play even if you make different choices I thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do e g too much eating and he gets fat 
A great Launch game For those of you who played Trauma Center on the DS this game is the same old same old but still worth the buy for you can play it on a full size tv For those of you who have not played the game the game is one of the most unique and challenging games i have ever played As one can tell from the pictures you are a surgeon who does everything from remove glass to fighting wierd bug things that live inside people The game is a great port from the DS and the Wiimote controls great in this game I highly recommend this game 
This Game Rocks This is the first time that I have owned a Madden football game I can t compare it to the other games but this one rocks I love the highlight stick and hit stick Pros Good graphics great commentary and very fun Cons If you challenge a play it never gets reversed It only gets reversed if the other team challenges Notice I have only 1 con so this game is a must get for Xbox 
Not as user friendly as 06 I like it so far and I think the new features are going to be cool once I get better at them I just don t like that they made precision passing more complicated and they changed the kicking but I think I figured that out I beat the computer by 52 points so I guess I am doing okay never mind that I was playing the Texans ha ha I haven t really used precision passing though just gotten lucky on my passing for the most part I liked that it did it for me in 06 
Even the suckiest singers can do this We got a group of 5 friends together to do Guitar Hero 1 and 2 DDR and now Karaoke Revolution Party It s freaking cool The songs list is very good and there s something for everyone Easy to figure out too 
It s Grrrrreat My daughter and her friends can play for hours They love it 
Awsome I never want to leave my freinds houses I dont have this games but my freind had a party and we played it nonstop It is a awsome game but the only place i can find that noncountry ones are at carcut city And when I went theresomeone had baught it before me I am so happy i found it on Amazon I love it and it I have to say is one of the only reasons why I want to leave with my freinds Juat Kidding If you love to sing and want to be a famous singer this is the game 4 you I think it helps you sing better because it tells you the pich and if you dont get the right pitch it comes of your score 
FAMILY FUN This is our 2nd Karaoke Revolution as we have the original one as well It was amazing to see how they evolved With a family of 7 there is not too many games that allow us to play as individuals Well this game delivers that and more The boys love the minigames the girls love to change their characters clothes based on how they feel and all of us love to sing We are not the Von Trapp family by any means but we can certainly have fun That s what the game delivers After a long week of stress work and school we have a Saturday night of Karaoke The kids love it This by far is the best investment into family time that we have ever made 
My Kids Love This This is so wonderful I have a 7yr old boy and a 9yr old girl and they cannot get enough of this My 9yr old had a sleep over and the other girls now want to come over all the time to play I even have had some of the parents inquiring about it This is so much fun even my husband and I have a great time playing The kids love that you can creat your own characters and change their outfits anytime and when you do well you can unlock new songs and outfits We can t wait to get another microphone so we can do more 
Amazingly fun game must buy Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs great easy gameplay and perfect party game features If you ve never tried a karaoke game now s the time to play First the basic setup You get to FULLY customize your character We re talking black white male female heavy skinny athletic Then you go for hair styles hair colors outfits down to the shoes and jewelry You can evey use your EyeToy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character It is simply amazing Then we go onto the song list I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems I love karaoke games This song list is by far my favorite song list of all time and it s true for my boyfriend as well There are a good mix of jumping songs slow romantic songs rocking songs and more In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs Because this is a party game they pretty much give you everything up front with a few exceptions You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters outfits as you go to keep things interesting A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes there are a bunch of fun mini games You can compete against other players try to play note matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game Even better if you have a dance pad you can sing and dance at the same time This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick but when you sing in a band you re actually expected to move around and dance Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills Even if you re not in a band you can see the challenges that your favorite singers face This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode or just singing along yourself with the songs Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had questionable versions of songs with them being obviously different from the original these songs are great sounding and many times I didn t have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them Highly highly recommended Rating 5 5 NOTE The previous reviewer says this has the Aretha Franklin version of Natural Woman I m rather sure it s the Carole King version 
A great game only gets better and better + 1 8 Players + Now has 50 songs + You can design and create your own characters or choose from old favorites + EyeToy lets you put yourself into the game + Duets + Option of using a dance pad and incorporating Dance Dance Revolution along with the singing + Gold Platinum Diamond perfect score rankings + 69 items to unlock and you can access the unlocking status to see what it takes to progress + They ve gotten rid of the solo challenge section which is where you had to unlock most of the items in the past + Games modes Quickplay one player version Arcade the player with the highest score wins Medley sing short clip versions of 3 5 songs all in a row Sing and Dance Minigames KR Challenge variety of game modes Duets Duets Medley Knock out Out sing your opponent to knock them out of the game Knock out Medley Sing off 2 players alternate lines to get the highest score + Demo of DDR Extreme that has 3 songs to choose from I have loved Karaoke revolution from the beginning I didn t think it could be any better than the 3rd version when they added the duets This version takes the game to a whole new level There is a wide variety of songs so many different types of people can play There are several songs that begin locked but it didn t take too long to get them unlocked The mini games are terrible and there was no need for them on the disk I found that it is near impossible to both sing and dance at the same time If you don t know all the words to a song it is impossible to read the singing and dance lines at the same time Besides it s extremely difficult to speak much less sing while exerting yourself on the dance pad I recommend having one person sing and another dance This changes it up and gives you some great songs to dance to I like the DDR games but never have been crazy about the songs so I really like the great songs Here is a complete list of the songs on the game as well as the artist of the version of the song Ain t Nothing Like the Real Thing Marvin Gaye Tammi Terrell Ain t Too Proud to Beg The Temptations Always Atlantic Starr American Woman Lenny Kravitz Brick House The Commodores Call Me Blondie Crazy Aerosmith Crazy in Love Beyonce Do You Really Want To Hurt Me Culture Club Drive Incubis Dust in the Wind Kansas Endless Love Lionel Richie Diana Ross Every Little Thing She Does is Magic The Police Everybody Wants to Rule the World Tears for Fears Everywhere Michelle Branch Santana Fame Irene Cara from the soundtrack Fly Hilary Duff For You I Will Monica Greatest Love of All Whitney Houston Headstrong Trapt Here I Go Again Whitesnake I Don t Want to be Gavin DeGraw I ve Had The Time of My Life Bill Medley Jennifer Warnes Dirty Dancing soundtrack I Left My Heart in San Francisco Tony Bennett I Love Rock and Roll Joan Jett I Will Always Love You Whitney Houston If You Could Only See Tonic I ll Be Edwin McCain Material Girl Madonna Me and Bobby McGee Janis Joplin Pain Jimmy Eat World Pieces of Me Ashley Simpson Play That Funky Music Wild Cherry Start Me Up The Rolling Stones Superstition Stevie Wonder Sweet Caroline Neil Diamond Takin Care of Business Bachman Turner Overdrive Take On Me A Ha That s Amore Dean Martin The Game of Love Michelle Branch Time After Time Cyndi Lauper Truth Is Fantasia Barrino Turn the Beat Around Gloria Estefan Unforgettable Nat King Cole Uptown Girl Billy Joel Waiting for a Girl Like You Foreigner What I Like About You Romantics Who Can It Be Now Men at Work You re My Best Friend Queen You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman Aretha Franklin Final Verdit Run don t walk to buy Karaoke Revolution Party 
Playstation 2 Memory Card 8MB I love it that card my childrens have one for your own games 
Good Quality Memory Cards What can I say about memory cards Well they re nice looking with their colorful translucent casings I ve been using mine for about a month now and have had no problems 
Lots of fun Square Enix is the best rpg developer on the planet Valkyrie is as much fun as ffs 1 10 graphics sound control and fun are all present in Valkyrie Profile 2 I highly recommend this title 
I dont know about this VP I bought this one the same time I did Baten Kaitos Origins and I can say it don t hold up to the original but comes close you can tell Square had their hands in this one I liked the 2 D style of the first one the 3 D graphics are very impressive but dont really fit with the gameplay My 4 star overall comes again from the battle system It holds true to the 1 button controls 1 character but the movement system needs to go it uses a full range system like Star Ocean but changes to the attack view to do the fighting similar to the original Ultimate Magic and those really awesome super moves are still intact Im not far into the game and they already have 2 characters from the original star here and thats Arngrim and Lezard Valeth which is cool they were 2 of my favs i cant wait to see all the characters If the make Valkyrie Profile 3 Hrist I would like to see a return of the hand drawn sprites and the riddence of that movement system 
Never got to the first and I don t care I never played the original and don t really want to This game was such a treasure to find with it s phenomonal music and graphics engrossing gameplay twisted plot and the variety of characters possible to play I have lost a lot of sleep over this game and I m not even half way done If anything it has some of the best show of PS2 graphics I have seen something to expect from a Square Enix production The wind moving through the environments the water trickling the sort of dream like haze in the towns It all culminates into an eye pleaser if nothing else But the gameplay and game engineering is also top quality The character designs are very diverse with many periods of time and cultures represented There is a fairly even mix of female and male characters as well as classes like archers light warriors mages ect The menu navigation and ability to load different game data at anytime other than combat is a serious perk that many take for granted You can keep loading a game when you don t get the einherjar you want until the randomized selection gives you the perfect group you are looking to adventure with The ability to instantly travel to any location on the map without lengthy travel from location to location keeps the pace nice and brisk giving you only what you want buying equipment and battles The difficulty is right where it needs to be if you do a quick run game you will have a tough time beating the boss It s nice not to have leveling forced on you but rather as an elective thing so that you can get through the story when you want to The battles are clever mixing tactical RPG with action making it very engaging and actually fun There is a degree of button mashing but then again it s not a static or boring as the your turn my turn cast a spell drink a potion It s actually combat like it should be I can t praise this game enough I don t care how good the first was it can t be better than this one This will certainly go down as a best title for the PS2 If I had any complaints it would be the recycled voice commentary for different einherjar and the fact that they really aren t involved with the main story line Oh and since they would be stupid not to make a third one customizable armor would have been the cream of the crop VP2 is a solid offering for the last PS2 has to offer 
Solid but contains the pitfalls of most tri ace games My experience with developer tri ace s games dates back to the original Playstation era with Star Ocean The 2nd Story Like most gamers on this side of the world this was probably the one of the first tri ace titles that had and created enough of a buzz to form a niche of fans The other game which is credited with a simular yet even bigger buzz was the original Valkyrie Profile Unfortunately the yield from the initial pressing run of that game was so low so tri ace wouldn t lose to much if the game didn t sell or catch on by the time I had heard the hype surrounding VP and wanted to give the game a try it was much too late copies of the game were selling at astronomical prices on e bay much like how sealed copies of Final Fantasy VII are selling now Because of this I was ecstatic when a sequel which in this case is actually a prequel was announced so I could finally experience what I had missed out on the first time in one form or another Granted VP2 is not a complete carbon copy of the original but the majority of the gameplay elements cross the game generation gap so in essence this game should probably give you an idea of what the original itself was like So would I say that I was blown away or impressed by what I missed out with missing the original VP Not really To start with the game is simply beautiful There are some dazzling effects from leaves and grass waving in the breeze to various types of weather pounding some of the locals This is what one should expect from a last generation PS2 title Sure every once in a while the battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters are standing on air but that is so minor it doesn t matter The only gripe I have is I wish the characters weapons changed depending on what they currently have equipped However since the character designs are so dependant on the default look of the weaponry the above simply wouldn t work very well Combat is Valkyrie s claim to fame much like it is in other tri ace games like Star Ocean This is a good thing considering the amount of time you ll spend in battle mode leveling up the game s massive number of characters of which only a handful are actually involved in the story the others just seem to be there At a quick glance the battle system seems to be a button mashers dream but like a good 3D fighting series Soul Caliber or Tekken those who know what their doing will always get further or have less difficulty as things can be difficult enough Other combat related issues also sprout up reviving an ally requires you to be near the ally s body and status effects are so not your friend especially when the whole party is inflicted at once especially with poison shutter As fun as combat is there are quite a few hitches to be aware of such as wasting AP on a dash and getting nowhere because your party is caught on the edge of something in the environment or when party members become separated for the same reason limiting your attack options until you take the time and go back and get them This becomes especially aggravating when you re trying to finish battles as quickly and efficiently as possible to receive experience and crystal bonuses The change from a 2D fighting environment in VP to a 3D one in VP2 works but the above issues make you yearn for 2D battles of the original which would probably be devoid of these problems The game s skill system is another area that initially seems interesting and clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome You ll form rune words with your equipment and accessories to unlock new potential skills Note the word potential in the previous sentence Unlocking a new skill doesn t grant the character the skill automatically only though battle can the skill be used and permanently learned At first glance this is a good thing since it prevents abuse think FFIX skill system here but the player then quickly finds out it may well usually take a long to learn said skill Instead of being awarded a set amount of points towards your skills after an enemy defeat like in most normal RPGs a percentage earned towards potential skills based on the average level of your current party and that of the enemy s Because of this you ll constantly be seeking out stronger and stronger enemies and you ll hardly ever find an undeniable great place to level up You ll also be contending with the never ending equipping and unequipping of equipment while doing this and often means your party is usually far from wearing the strongest available equipment at all times something that is usually a given in most RPGs Traversing dungeons is probably the most noteworthy aspect of VP2 after the battle system The first few are a complete cakewalk and teach you the ropes the later ones can really test you sanity and your brainpower Correct sealstone usage and photon know how go a long way towards completely clearing them of all their contents Kudos to tri ace for the awesome auto map feature features like this need to become an industry genre standard In the sound department Motoi Sakuraba makes a rather subdued yet solid entrance seeming to ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style of composing It s not until much later until you hear a piece and you know yeah that s Sakuraba no doubt The voice overs are good but at the same time just a few tiers above decent Valkyrie Profile 2 also falls victim to problems that are prevalent in other tri ace games Some moments of unbalanced gameplay creep up on the player as the difficulty goes up a few notches without much warning The story is once again slow to start is this even a surprise anymore with tri ace games and some of the story twists you can see coming a mile away the one revelation at the end of Chapter 3 was so freaking obvious All this said is Valkyrie Profile 2 worth playing if you ve never experienced VP Yes However now having experienced it I honestly think I could have had waited for a price drop instead of buying it on day it came out Despite this I still look forward to playing the re release of the original on the PSP 
Great game but bad product Though I admit this game title is old that does not mean the product should be damaged 1 of the discs were probably damaged in storage and the game system is having trouble reading the disc This was my second attempt at getting the game the first time all the discs were broken so I returned them But this time only 1 was broken and I found that out too late Final Fantasy VIII is a great game but if only the discs were not broken 
A Fantasy Unlike Any Other When I think of an entire series such as Final Fantasy this game always seems to be the odd one out FFVIII does not take the medieval or archaic look that others in the series do I hardly agree with the gamers who do not see the potential this game has FF8 takes on a lot of unique elements that are more noticeable than other FF games One of the elements is the very unusual storyline In my opinion the storyline is rather impressive Though it overshadows on the blossoming love of the 2 main characters there is not a lot of predictability in the storyline No hidden characters and no actual villain remains the same throughout the game Another element is the gameplay Characters being able to draw and distribute elements is a little more refreshing to use than the Materia and Junction systems from previous FFs Graphics in Final Fantasy 8 are very exquisite The cutscenes are enough to illustrate the game without drawing away from the gameplay I especially enjoy the soundtrack to the game I mix all the video game music on my Ipod and often am confused about which game it comes from FF8 has a distinguished composition that makes it stand out from other video games As a lot of gamers know FF8 takes the series in a direction that other games did not take The lack of mini games is definitely an issue While Triple Triad is fun and addictive to take on it is a hassle to reload or restart the game if you lose valuable cards Also trading some of these valuable cards for items is a hassle too I found myself in desperate need of Invincibles for use as defense against the final boss The Guardian Forces almost forgot about them are exciting to acquire too Spending numerous time on sidequests should not be a requirement to beat the game though Also FF8 spends little interest in developing secondary characters but I do have to praise the excellence in overall dialogue writing Give FF8 a shot as a favor to yourself for the gamers who feel like it is a definite miss 
A great game for people who want something a little different I still remember getting this game on 9 9 99 the day it came out I love this game because of it s junction system and some of the other cool features in this game Unfortunatly from all of the people that I knew people either hated the game most of those people are on this side of the love hate group and a few people loved it Extremly Hardcore RPG fans seem to love it I love the game but this is the Final Fantasy game that a whole lot of people just can t stand It is a long game especially if you get stuck so a guide internet or actual guide i don t care will really help It is the easiest game to literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you a level up but using the junction system is also an important role in the game because it can raise your stats as well This is a game that you will have to play for yourself before you agree with the haters give it a spin please 
Nothing Like It Before Or Since Then Okay so there are tons of reviews on FFVIII with intense hatred and love on both ends of the spectrum So what to do if your indesicive about purchasing this game Here are some simple facts Whether or not you enjoy this game will hinge on the fact that you A Like Squall Leonhart B Enjoy sci fi based RPG as opposed to strict High Fantasy and finally C Have the patience to understand the Draw Junction system I loved this game very much because all three points were never an issue with me There were some weaknesses of the game but most just come from scripting and plot The primary one being a Lone Wolf Introvert leading an entire team of high spirited extroverts That would drive anyone up the wall though I think many people didn t like Squall because they knew someone like him in real life The only other real plot weakness is that the major big bad villans Edea Adel and Ultimecia seem to take a complete backseat to all of Squall s personal problems getting to know Rinoa learning more about his family I d rather have more of a balance between the two plot forces but that s about it The Draw Junction system which powers up the PC s requires a lot more thought than the other systems that FF is used to but if you can remember what stats are used for like Vit for defense and Spr for Magic Defense it will go a lot smoother If you like RPG s like Xenosaga or Phantasy Star or even Knights of the Old Republic then by all means get this in your collection just keep in mind the points I made before 
A Gem I have all the Final Fantasy Games except for VIII I just never got around to getting it I purchased VIII two months ago and I have currently beat it I though it was well worth playing The storyline was great Each charcter brought something spectacular to the game I never put it down The ending alone was worth it 10 of 10 for the best story and gfs Trinity 
a blood soaked epic western storyline GUN is a hyped TPS it is devoped by the same team who brought us tony hawk the game takes place in the 1890 s in and during the old west near kansas in the begging the protraginst cole white a man who should be in the age range of 24 betwenn 29 is on a hunting game with his father which is the basic tourtoul the abord a ship that is attacked by indins the ship blows apart but cole survies after 3 days he wakes up at the edge of the lake or river or what not that is i will not spoil the rest but gun takes a lot if populrey elements and puts it in one game examples include slow mo shooting from max payne you can get this by nailing head shots or cool ways of killing it works with only pistols but with any other gun it would be to easy it also goes to A FPS in the 10 15 seconds you use this many mature aspects while always a conteversy it is also populry In GUN youll see a lot of it to blowing a guys head apart and watching brain and tissue fly while the corpse just sparys froming a puddle scalping is what has gotten this game contercovsly a sclap is when a person whos dieing on the floor get s a knife taken to to there neck it s excatrated to say the least also if you kill a person with a cannon there limbs fly so expect to see an arm or a leg after you blow up dynimyte of fire a cannon there is also the abilty to set a person on fire or stab them with a knife while the are 100 still alive and there idea of a epic cutscene is haveing a mans fingers being blown off slitting thorats shooting a man with a shotgun out a 3rd story window and sticking a rifle in a mans mouth and then pulling the trigger the language is not what is in GTA the wariors or the godfather but it does keep a consistent flow of S and B words the S word is used over a Dozen times if you play through the game the B word will be used almost 50 times the enemys death cry is commanly you B ch or Son of a B h FREE ROAM GUN features 100 free roam side missons included the map is not that big with only 2 citys but it is the old west with no cars or faster transportion then a horse and buggy but the horse is what you will be riding most of the time epic storyline the games story foucus on revange but interduces implyed sexul acts backstabbing twists hearing amazing things flashbacks ETC saying that the voice acting is also gold thomas Janes voice as colton and pretty much everbodys voice is done in true fashion the things to complain about in GUN is the lack of online and being short the main game takes about 8 to 10 hours to finish 
GET THIS GAME You will not be dissapointed by buying this game If you like RPGs Action and or Adventure games you ll love this one There is soooooo much to do Even after you ve beat the game With the huge maps tons of free roaming space and exciting side missions you can play for hours without even starting the main mission The sound and graphics are just about the best I ve ever seen The mian story is also awesome It s easy to follow and tons of fun to play Buy this 
Not nearly as bad as everyone says it is I am scratching my head as to why everyone thinks that Gun is such a terrible game I bought it a few weeks ago at a reduced price and I really enjoy the game The graphics are quite nice the voice acting is really good and the gameplay itself is entertaining I really enjoy the open Western environment in the game Basically Gun is structured like a Grand Theft Auto game in that once you pass the first few missions you find yourself in an open environment that you are free to explore take up side missions or start the actual missions of the game Some of the side missions include ranching participating in the pony express working as a bounty hunter and arresting or killing fugitives playing Texas Hold Em at the saloon and hunting wild game Completing these missions will improve your characters abilities such they do tie in to the overall picture Gun features a Quickdraw mode of fire which is essentially the same feature used in Max Payne which slows down gameplay and allows you to make precise targeted shots Another feature I like about Gun is the fact that your character is able to buy weapons and items such as weapon upgrades to improve his overall strength You earn money through completing missions and side missions mining for gold and winning at gambling Many people complain that Gun is too short and that the overall story is not very in depth While there is some truth to this you should not pass up your chance to play Gun now that it is reduced to 20 In fact this game is actually a steal at 20 It is a much better game than people give it credit for 
With Gun it s a love hate form of relationship It s obvious Gun isn t for everyone I really enjoyed it as did a friend of mine but I ve read many reviews both on this website as well as elsewhere with thoughts that have been quite unlike my own I ve read that gamers thought the controls were too sinewy or that the storyline wasn t interesting enough or even that the Western genus alone isn t worth a game being made about it and personally I think that s entirely untrue Okay for one this isn t exactly the type of Western or even close to what you re familiar with regarding Clint Eastwood or John Wayne no this one is entirely different This is among the new breed of the Western genre that we ve never seen before where it more negates the predominant hero and focuses solely on the brutality that was the West Much like the HBO series Deadwood Gun not only brings us a vivid new creation into the eyes of an unsympathetic frontiersman with delightful mechanics such as riding horses firing bows and engaging in a more or less duel in the thoroughfare of whichever town you re in if you anger the townsfolk enough I think this sort of cruelty can not only be admired but enjoyed immensely if the right gamer will only give it a shot and get to know the controls The setting is fresh its many intricate greed driven plotlines causing for much distress for the lonely horseman and I think the music scored for this game only vitalizes the objective And two the sound which ties in with the game s score is just as powerful as it is heart warming I ve never enjoyed firing a six shooter so much in a game but granted there haven t been many opportunities for me to try one out which is another reason this game makes for such amazing gameplay it s never really been done before If given time I m sure I could come up with a few games that have been Western based but none as intriguing and tongue dissolving as Gun and I think even those who didn t like could agree with me on that In short it s just a beautiful game albeit with many areas that need improvement but overall plentifully satisfying There are a few issues though one the length of this game is dreadfully short With as many opportunities as this game was given I would think the creators would turn it into a twenty five or thirty hour game or at least give the gamer more sub missions to allocate his time to but in the end this game falls short of true masterful selection for those little tidbits that just didn t make the grain It was a great game for as long as it lasted but unfortunately that just wasn t very long With hope they ll create a sequel but I pray it ll be longer and much more enjoyable in that the horses will be as innate and fun to ride In all though I still say Gun was a supreme achievement I have enjoyed playing it and although it was incredibly short I still found it pleasant regardless because in the end playing the rugged protagonist that is only seeking revenge is often implemented in videogames but I can scarcely think of many that are better than Colton White well maybe Kratos from God of War 
Fun And Historically Detailed But Not Enough Places To Explore Gun is a Western themed game that features a young cowboy Colton White on the search to discover the secrets of his past The most impressive aspect is that the game is surprisingly detailed in its historical depiction of the Wild West For example the game shows the effects of railroad expansion on the American Indians while also including the Chinese coolies that worked on these railroads On the other hand the geography is way off as Colton can ride on horseback from Dodge City Kansas to Empire New Mexico in a matter of minutes Of course what really matters in a video game is how much fun it is to play and in this Gun receives fairly high marks The game is primarily mission based Colton must complete a variety of tasks both to advance the story line and to build up his stats through a series of side missions such as riding the pony express and catching outlaws I also enjoyed searching for gold mines However I wish the game allowed more free exploration For example the towns are full of buildings But it s really not possible to explore them except for the casino and a few others The game is also a little on the short side But still it s a fun gaming experience that s worth buying 
Great Rental Gun isn t a game that I would suggest you buy the reason is that it s pretty short You can probably finish it in a week The graphics are good and the sound is awesome on surround sound 20 weapons 30 upgrades good graphics hunting side mission lawmen side mission pony express side mission ranch hand side mission bounties side mission 44 gold to find enemies tear apart blood and gore poker tournaments not a lot of story levels interesting story interesting characters slow motion shooting with pistol 
Western Shootout I friends love Western themed games I must say this got me glued to the PS2 It is not fair to say it is better than Red Dead Revolver RDR had a lot of features that GUN did not Eg The slow motion gun showdown OK as for GUN The only two Cons are that is short Two It is relatively easy But please note there are 1 Variety of missions 2 Variety of cool weapons 3 Interesting Game story I only more games of that genre come out It seems to be popular Thanks Nawa 
Wonderful system I purchased my 360 about 6 months ago on a whim and have loved it ever since The graphics look amazing on my plasma HDTV The wireless controls feel great and are very responsive Xbox Live is by far the best online service for any console The only other system I am planning to buy from this generation is the Wii and only because are there are key titles that only Nintendo produces 
Awesome this thing is awesome i recommend the premium however cause the core cause with absolutely nothin 
XBOX 360 Takes Over This system is great for the parent or kid looking for some fun You will save a few dollars if you buy the Core System and then the 20GB hard drive but it is not worth it to get the Core This system that has the hard drive come with the wireless controller which is great to have You can play the Xbox 360 for hours This console is way better than the PS3 in the sense of the price The PS3 has a little better graphics but the cost of the console is outrageous If you are looking for a holiday gift for a teenager or even a college kid the XBOX 360 is the way to go Also if you are planning to buy one from another person online if it seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true XBOX 360 w Hard Drive Pro s Wireless Controller 20GB Hard Drive Ethernet Cable Con s nothing worse XBOX 360 Core Pro s Nothing better Con s Wired Controller No Hard Drive No Ethernet cable Playstation 3 Pro s Little better graphics 60GB Hard Drive available Wireless Controller available Con s Online sucks Overheating possibility All in all the Xbox 360 w 20GB Hard Drive is better than the Xbox 360 Core and the PS3 
Great System Just take the right measures I bought my 360 pro on summer 2006 with it I got Oblivion Ghost Recon NFS Most Wanted and Hitman Blood Money Everything was going great until two months ago it started freezing regularly I didn t pay much attention to it but the week after that I got the three rings of death yup General Hardware Failure I got a little frustrated but I immediately sent an email to Microsoft with my situation They answered within 24 hours and said that the system had to be repaired I was shocked because I don t even live in the US I started calling my local video game stores and none of them were fixing 360s yet After I had called like 5 stores I called a small store in the middle of a residential area and guess what The man told me that his 360 suffered the same problem and that he could fix it I was a little skeptical but anyway I took my system there and left it overnight For my surprise the next morning I got a call from him saying that it was fixed I couldn t believe it I asked him how much he was going to charge and he said Oh Just give me 20 bucks Then he told me that six months ago his 360 had had the same problem and that he had bought both the Pelican Fan Stand and the Nyko intercooler and he hadn t had the problem since The two accessories together both make like 33 dollars and they prevent your console from frying so its absolutely worth it just try to follow the warnings that the people who had bought the two fans have posted because they are very important and could mean the difference between messing your xbox up and letting you play countless hours without overheating The last games I bought were Splinter Cell and Gears of War and now I m able to play 5+ hours without the console even getting warm to the touch of my fingers Yes the system overheats you just have to take the right measures to solve your problems Hope this review helped cheers 
We NEED Katamari Not only is We Love Katamari way better then the first but you get to play the prince s cousins Some of the cousins are faster some are slower some seem stronger then others Also some of the Katamari s have earth elements such as a big snowball Katamari a fireball one too The fireball is kind of tricky you have to keep the fire on it burning if not the level fails also watch out for the water it will put it out no matter how big it is Last but not least to finish We Love Katamari you need to convert your progress from Katamari Damacy to this one If you did delete the first one from you memory card then to bad you ll have to play the first all over again 
Just plain fun We ordered this game because we had played the demo on another disc and we thought it was funny It has been a joy to play and lots of fun My two sons have enjoyed it inmensely Non violent no bloody scenes no fights the game is just fun for anyone I have even played it a couple of times and it seems like the kind of game to enjoy after a stressful day I recommend it 
You ll never get tired of this game This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play You don t exactly finish it like other video games but are always trying to beat your fastest time so it doesn t get old as fast As a matter of fact we wore out our last copy and this is our second I love it and I m the parent My kids and I play it together and cheer each other on The only thing I would change is make the two player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally I would keep them in the corner instead Overall highly recommend this game More than your money s worth 
I love to roll hit This game is a lot of fun The level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music isn t as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days 
Excellent game Thought the first Katamari game was addictive This one is worse It s just like the other only you have more levels and different types of quests like cleaning up a room and rolling up 1000 cranes to help out a friend who is sick One of the best parts is you can play as any cousin you have found in a level and there are dozens more royal presents In fact you can wear 2 at once The King is still hilarious In fact every time you beat a major level you get a short little cut scene about his past You even get to hear him speak in Japanese at the end That was a huge treat for me Many people complain about the graphics I think the simple blocky graphics greatly suits the game It would lose its charm if the graphics were as good as a newer Final Fantasy game The bright colors funky sound and even funkier music just make this game adoreable while making you uttering over and over again What in the world There s only two complaints I have the multiplayer and the length of the game The multiplayer is still lacking there aren t many levels to choose from and it can get a little old after a while Also the game is relatively short I beat it within 3 days of playing it maybe 2 3 hours a day However this can easily be combatted with the side quests You still have to find all the royal presents sometimes there are more than one in a level cousins 39 in all there are 4 you have to find in one of the last levels and about 3 extra levels you obtain after you beat the game The ending credits is even a level This is why it loses one star it s really more of a 4 5 star In conclusion We Love Katamari is a GREAT game It ll have you hooked I reccomend it to anyone who can hold a controller That s the only skill you need to play it And a sense of creativity of course 
Look elsewhere This headset works very well If you re not used to the rubber in canal ear piece there are several other tips that are a bit less intrusive It has worked quite well in the limited amount of time that I ve used it on XBConnect But the price You could probably buy a similar Plantronics headset that would be compatable with a Communicator cartridge adapter which isn t included in this package you have to buy it seperately but not designed specifically for the Xbox for less than half this price I was very fortunate to find two at Circuit City as they were being discontinued recently for five bucks a piece Maybe Amazon will soon drop the price like everyone else 
Forgetable comfortness This microphone is so comfortable I forget I have it on sometimes I mistakenly wear it even if I m not playing an online game If the over the head type microphones bother you alot then you want this microphone It is also good for people with glasses as it won t knock them out of place I wear glasses and the regular xbox live mic always messed my glasses up With the Halo 2 headset it does not bother with my glasses at all Consider this microphone if you are bothered with the regular Xbox Live headset 
Perfectly balanced and perfect noise auditory levels Having been working for the U S Air Force for some odd time the noise in a cramped jet cockpit with a 30 000 lb thrust jet engine just 20 feet behind you the noise is just too unbearable and they give us laboratory designed and tested earpices that REALLY help and might I add these things are perfectly balanced and have the perfect noise cancelling levels like the ones we get So if someone in your living room was talking to you everyone in the Xbox wouldn t hear but it only takes a soft voice for them to listen and instead of the garbled and echoy noise you get on the standard headset this comes out crisp and clean Also it comes with 4 interchangable earpieces Large and small of rubber and large and small of foam composition Now if it had big enough jacks I d bring this in the plane with me Believe me this thing is worth it s money and then some 
Awesome This headset is way better than the X Box one considering the X Box one broke in a hurry The sound quality is awesome and you don t get any annoying breathing in the mic Pick this one up 
Much better than the other headset While I did not have to spend retail on this headset I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay I did have to buy the communicator which can be found on gamestop com and it was still worth the money It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you While it is not worth 50 if you can get it as part of a deal with something else by all means do it Note I said this before in my review but the Communicator can be found on gamestop com or on Amazon if you type Xbox Live Communicato 
mechassault live think you can beat me if you have Mechassault and an xbox live gamer tag try playing me i usually play capture the flag and my gamer tag is minor00 so if you see me be sure to challenge me to a game because this game rocks 
Great game cant wait for the second one I love this game and i ve been playing it every since it came out Its not one of those boring after a while Pros Good graphics Good gameplay Lots of mechs Live support Content download A LOT up to 8 people on xbox live lots of missions Cons Can get a bit repetetiv 
The Good The Bad and The Ugly This review is going to be based on 3 categories The Good The Bad and The Ugly The Good eye inspiring graphics and special effects Very impressive nightmaresh sound effects Very scarey game with lots and lots of heart stopping surprises The game will have you either jumping out of your seat or shooting up anything that moves or falls to the floor The Bad The game lacks a lot from the original doom series Over half of the original creatures from Doom 1 2 and Final doom are missing which is very disappointing The sound track along with the creatures did not resemble anything next to the original doom series except for the rocket launching Revenant and the Archvile Id software must have spent a lot of time designing those two unfortunently they forgot to add the rest of the creatures As for the Imp s I didn t have a clue to what those tall creatures with 8 eight eyes throwing fire balls at me were I didn t know what they were until I downloaded it on my PDA in the game What a disappointment A lot of the times while I was playing the game it seemed as if I was play Quake 2 or Half Life but not Doom Don t get me wrong about the game The game is a good game but they should have named it DOOM The Beginning instead of Doom 3 The Ugly No joystick or game pad support The only controller support is keyboard and mouse which will cause your left hand to get carpartunnel from constantly pressing the TAB SHIFT F W A S Q and D keys The game is way too dark A lot of the times you re shooting at open air and then turning the flash light on to see if they re dead or still walking around only to find out that they re behind you tearing you to pieces I heard a lot about people stating that the game caused their computers to slow down to a crawl I myself didn t have that problem My computer is 3 years old and what is even worse is I m running a video card that is 6 years old My system is an AMD XP 2800+ over clocked to be equal to an AMD XP 3200+ 640MB ram Diamond Monster Sound 300MX and an old 3DFX Voodoo 5500 with 64MB video ram It took me awhile to find the right driver combination for my voodoo card because 3DFX went out of business back in December of 2000 But anyway under the timedemo it states that I get 19 FPS but under actual game play I get 38 FPS in High Quality mode with a resolution of 1024x768 Go figure I can t use the Ultra High Quality mode because my Voodoo card doesn t support TnL Transform and Lighting and I can t tell the difference between High Quality and Ultra High Quality except Ultra Hight Quality runs slower By the way My video card and sound card are not direct X 9 0 compliant so don t believe everything that you read on the system requirements 
LOVE this game I bought it several days ago and cannot separate myself from this game The graphics is amazing 
Good but not as great or revolutionary as it should have been I remember when Doom 3 first came out there was a lot of hype on the Internet People were claiming it would blow away the release of Half Life 2 with id s new engine etc etc etc Unfortunately Doom 3 is a rather standard shoot em up It s fun for a little while but it lacks the originality and inventiveness of games like Half Life 2 which was amazing Half Life kept me engaged because the terrain changes the characters change and so on In Doom 3 it s basically just a lot of walking around through dimly lit corridors Monsters jump out and you kill them It s fun for a while but then it becomes tiring much like a haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight Furthermore the graphics engine really isn t what everyone made it out to be I just bought a new PC this year and it runs this game very well on maximum settings the gameplay isn t choppy or anything But even at full potential with graphics I think they re just OK The shadowing is brilliant but the textures are average and some of the characters in the cut scenes are downright laughable one of the Commanders early on looks like a character from AvP 2 and that game came out in 2001 The in game play is much better characters look more realistic but I have to wonder what the rush was with the cut scenes One would think they d spend more attention to detail on these Overall I have to admit that while I found this fun at times it gets tedious after a while I mean the gimmick with the flashlight is annoying as someone else pointed out I think in the beginning it s okay but they should have planted an upgrade early on in the game such as a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top or nightvision goggles that last for a minute or two before they have to be recharged because dropping your flashlight and picking up a weapon while you re being shot at by enemies is annoying And as another reviewer pointed out the PDA gimmick gets old fast Overall this has moments of absolute brilliance but I felt like so much more could have been done with it They should have abandoned the concept of being alone in the dark throughout the entire game and done a bit more with it I would have loved to have explored the Martian planet more or even levels that don t look exactly the same Because the repetitive nature of the game is ultimately what sinks it It s good but I think Half Life 2 was far better and the graphics engine on HL was stunning even two years later 
Don t let stingey reviews deter you from this game A brilliant remake of the original classic Although I am an avid fan of the first DOOM I strongly urge you to NOT juxtapose the two If you sit back and pick apart the differences between them you ll never enjoy DOOM 3 Why is this game well worth the buy Many reasons Superb graphics is the first that you ll notice The environment is rich and detailed Don t worry about whether or not your computer can handle it You can easily build one that is easily capable at running the game with full settings for less than 900 and if you re comp is so old that you can t run it like this you may have been due for an upgrade anyways The weapons are great and very realistic Like the real world your arsenal must be reloaded after so many rounds are fired A handy pair of digits will help you monitor your clip and total ammo for any weapon though So plan ahead and keep your guns fully loaded As for the endless series of hallways that some people are complaining about it makes absolutely no sense to have a stadium set up on a Mars Research Base The game offers plenty of larger rooms to adequately utilize heavier weapons such as the rocket launcher without blowing your own face off The ambient sounds of the game are more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat Dead bodies will randomly levitate and fly across the room grates will be knocked around be unseen forces and Betruger s haunting laugh will often accompany many of these ghostly actions and more The enemies are fierce the enemies are bad as in fearful any one of them can go from easy to kill to downright lethal You may not get very many good looks at them but you really shouldn t be trying to admire the pixels of something that s trying to kill you Take a screenshot and look at that later if you want to take in what the monsters look like Experiment with your arsenal learn the best weapon for the job and conserving ammo won t be a problem at all The big issue that most people seem to have is that of lighting Yes in the 22nd century you d expect Marines to have lights mounted on their weapons ID Software isn t stupid a flashlight on all of your guns would have made the game a lot easier and a lot less fun By switching from your light to your gun the game forces you to choose between being able to see the enemy and being able to attack the enemy Remember this game is of the Horror genre And horror thrives on you asking questions like Where is it What is it Where is it gonna pop out at next Go rent a horror movie and you ll see what I mean It s dark DOOM 3 is meant to be like this Buy the game or borrow it from a buddy Turns the lights off and turn the volume up If you like horror it will pull you right in 
A short criteria so s not to bore you I ve been through Doom3 now three times The first time I didn t even cheat I won t go into how great a game it is but will stick to the few short comings One the game started off perfect A little bit of realism goes a long way but later on degraded into a world of comic bookish nightmareism skeletons with missile launchers on their shoulders come on The bugger man with a rocket launcher in pace of a right hand AAAH It isn t hard to figure out why ID did it they were trying to spice it up a bit to keep it interesting I understand I just don t agree Two no mass attacks by monsters to use up all your hard won ammunition Instead you transport our marine to h ll to once more search for and find the same things all over again all these games do that A monster with a nazi helmet and whip more comic book filler Three a game that has to cheat in every other room searched gets a little irritating You know the monster is on the other side of that darkened doorway You throw a dozen gernades in there the monster isn t hurt You take that step forward the monster jumps out and you blast it And then of course the monster which appeared out of nowhere behind you attacks The answer of course is walk backward trip the If Then statment in the program shoot the monster behind and turn around and shoot the one in front on your second attempt to get through the door I do get tired of computer gamecheating because I makes me have to cheat to beat the game I don t mind the dark areas the whole base just went to h ll I would expect the lights not to always work Four I ve heard those h ll Knights have to be destroyed with that big green glowing plasma gun cannon Well I did it with thirty eight hand grenades The game would have been I think better if two or three had been turn loose to roam the hallways looking for humans to munch on randomly Five basically never enough fighting room Understandable for a station on another world with pressurized atmosphere Rooms would all be small Exploding barrels in pressurized enviroment what a hoot Yuck yes I said Yuck instead of the number belted ammunition for machineguns usually came in 100 round belts not sixty Mini guns used chained belts I know I use to repair them The plasma gun s munitions travel far too slow The shotgun needs a longer barrel so it still has a choke to keep the pellets from spread out too wide and becoming useless after ten feet Handgrenades can t be thrown properly Light machinegun s firing rate is half what it should be and for goodiness sake get some duck tape for that flashlight and tape to you weapon The list could go on for these little things but the game is easily worth the money Remember these are mostly suggestions for ID future program 
Good not that scary I ve bought this game for my new laptop like 2 weeks ago and the graphics are great The things that I really don t like about this game is that the controls are not that flexible compared to some FPS games because the most levels of doom3 is pretty dark and toggling between flashlight and weapon at the same time when the enemy appears is really tideous In fact the Quake4 is much more flexible in controls due to attached flashlight to machineguns and overall game interface This game is not that scary as long as you know the enemy s patterns of habit of appearing everywhere 
I was blown away by this phenom of a game When Blinx first came out all the reviews didn t really know what to make of it They said that this is one of the most innovative titles to come out in the past few years but then they started going on about how hard it is and how it gets repetitive in that you go through each stage clearing enemies to proceed Well what game isn t repetitive You could just as easily say all you do in Tetris is line up blocks or all you do in Mario 64 is collect stars And reading about the time controls sounded so confusing I didn t think I d be able to handle a 10 minute time limit in each level while controlling time So just a week ago I got Blinx and couldn t wait to see how it played after countless love it or hate it reviews from numerous people After watching the cool little intro and breezing through the first 2 worlds that night I saw nothing wrong with this game And the only people that will have that much trouble with this are those who only play rpgs or sports games and don t give platformers a try The time control is nothing to worry about either it s very simple to understand and actually you don t have to use time controls that often The main story of Blinx is short and to the point Which is good because I m really sick of games spending 15 minutes on intros just to tell you this is what s going on in a pointless FMV Blinx has a quick 3 5 minute intro showing you that he s part of millions of Time Sweepers time custodians that clean up any problems with time on different planets But suddenly something goes wrong on one of them and a princess is kidnapped Blinx sees her and gets determined to save her and the planet You go through 9 worlds in each world except the last there are 3 levels one shop and a boss at the end to get her back In each level you collect time crystals to gain time powers and sweep use your Sweeper vaccum cleaner garbage to take out all the enemies in a level to proceed to the next It s actually very fun and I never got tired of it Sweeping up different objects deals different damage to enemies A garbage can or flower pot won t do a whole lot but a beat up jaloppy piano or even a 16 ton weight now there s the real damage Time crystals are all over the place and you gain a time power by collecting 3 or 4 of the same type Getting 3 of one kind and 1 of any other gets you one power but getting 4 of the same time crystal gets you two of that power The powers you can use are rewind fast forward pause record and slow motion and hearts gain you a retry If you haven t figured it out from other reviews yet it s kind of obvious when you need to use some of the powers Like if you see a bridge fall down use rewind and watch it rebuild itself to cross And if you can t walk up a river that s pushing you back rewind it so you can walk up with ease If there are two switches you need to activate record yourself jumping on one while you jump on the other and open the door s The main ones you ll be using though are pause and slow motion mostly because these work on anything even the bosses Yeah people go on about how hard the bosses are I guess they didn t figure out how to use time powers But the last boss oh man That guy took me at least a total of 9 hours to beat I just beat him this morning at 2 59 49am yes I got the exact second and flipped out I was proud of myself He s up there with Pocky Rocky for SNES s last boss It s like the developers got mad at something and put all the difficulty into him Because the rest of the game is pretty easy until that part And as a side note I love how the ice levels are actually ice Not that magical non slippery ice they have in other games Here you pretty much skate on the floor and if you go too fast or hit a wall you fall over and get back up It s the small things like that that make me love this game even more Graphically Blinx is stunning for the most part Remember 10 years ago when you saw screens for Donkey Kong Country and were impressed by the models That s what I got here Blinx himself has some of the best graphics I ve ever seen See how he looks on the box That s exactly how he looks in game You can see the fur on him when he s up close and they got every single detail down perfectly Every level also has just as much detail there are no bare areas at all There s always something going on And of course I can t leave out the water Everyone seems to be impressed with that no matter what they think of the actual game Try slowing down time and running through a river canal Or pausing it to see the trail left behind The developers did a fantastic job Unfortunately some of the enemies don t have as much detail as Blinx does A lot of them are just one colored shapes that didn t really require much effort to create But then there are some that are really cool in design So it s a little mixed bag there And that last boss man I won t even start on that thing There s no slowdown unless you re blasting tons of garbage at enemies without stopping The only other slowdown is when you make it happen It appears to run at 30 frames a second and there s nothing wrong with that I really enjoyed the music too and would love to get a soundtrack The main theme if fun and enjoyable and the first level contains the most magical music I ve ever heard The rest of the game has good music always fitting the mood of the setting The final boss music really puts you in the mood to take em out it s full of energy and concentration Sound effects are cartoony but that s not a bad thing When blasting garbage and an enemy you get a zany little effect that sounds like something from Tom Jerry Voices however I m confused They re not bad In fact Blinx has great delivery and voice acting for not having much of a personality he s a platformer character He doesn t need personality But I could ve sworn they spoke Japanese in the beginning I know for a fact I translated some of the words meaning what the text on the screen meant But at the end I didn t understand a single thing I guess they made up their own language here just like they had in Panzer Dragoon Orta But there isn t a lot of language going on just the belts from Blinx most of the time Though he does say some things in English once in a while I noticed Yay and Burned kitty food when he got knocked out and into a lava pit Keep an ear out for what the pigs say when you hit them with garbage whenever they show up in a level I swear the one you fight most of the time goes You suck when he gets hit It s pretty intimidating to hear that even if you re winning Blinx didn t disappoint me at all It has tons of replay too You get a rank when you complete a level and if you get all A+ or S+ ranks you get a cool treat Plus there are cat medals in each level that add to little bonus clips The first few are pretty lame but as you get more they turn out to be great Going back and figuring out new ways to beat bosses is always fun too I just can t stress how much I love this game On my shelf I put this ABOVE Knights of the Old Republic and Jet Set Radio Future But right behind Panzer Dragoon Orta From what I ve heard the demo for the sequel I m amazed this thing did well enough to get a sequel is even better Blinx 2 will probably be the first Xbox game I get for full price and when it comes out So get this if you re looking for a little bit of an old school feel with superb graphics and quality and of course fun And that s all that matters in games having fun 
Diss it or hit it Blinx is a very exciting game to play In the beginning it was very confusing but shortly I learned how to play This game is very challenging colorful and long But I have to admit I really enjoy playing this game The graphics are awesome Just marveously awesome 
Overpriced here on Amazon Don t spend the 60 someone is charging for this Just go to Best Buy and buy the package for 20 LO 
A great bargain I was looking for the Black and White Deluxe Version with expansion pack and came across this I was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews by Computer Dude said none of the games have activation numbers Let me start by saying that this is not true This is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games really five including the Black and White expansion pack and on the back were all five activation numbers I installed Black and White without any problems and was up half the night playing it The only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation manuals etc except for the four page installation guide are on the game CDs So if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate 
good stuff i was so excited over this package 4 games in one and all of them got pretty good reviews online so i checked it out AWESOME this package is definatly worth the money Black and White is a very unique game that ive spent hours playing Freedom Fighters is amazing i loved the squad aspects and the action LOTR is very cool but i have some framerate problems even tho my comp exceeds the recommended requirements the only reason i gave this package a 4 is because medal of honor doesnt work on my computer and tech support did not help at all I ve heard good things about MOH so if it happens to work on your computer then that just makes this deal even better This is a great package and i recommend it to all i got all the cd keys for all the games so the other reviewer who did not must have just been unlucky 
for all those Pacino Fans this is Quake Meets GodFather meets GTA Folks anyone been waiting to witness PACINO style violence this is it I just got this game and it rocks i need to sleep i haven t slept in 24 hours its too cool all RAGE all the time and heavy tommy gun like gun The fact the game takes place after the movie ended is incredible the only reason i gave it a 4 because i thought they could have borrowed more camera movement and direction from GTA or the God father engines The graphics and backgrounds are stunning I spent a good time on the ocean and beautiful oceans of yester Florida Coast 
Its an okay game But I miss freedom and flexibility Scarface The World Is Yours Vivendi Games was one of the most hyped videos games of 2006 Following the success of the Godfather game people couldn t wait to get their hands on the Scarface game especially when some reviewers said it was as good or better than the Grand Theft Auto Games The game takes on a what if scenario i e what if Tony Montana didn t die at the end of Scarface but instead loses everything and has to rebuild his empire First I will start off with an important matter player control and movement In comparison to past Vivendi Universal games I will say that the player control and movement is very good Next up weapons I personally felt like the aim and shooting ability could have been vastly improved According to the tutorial you press L1 to target and R1 to shoot but they failed to mention you must use the analog stick to aim your weapon Maybe you don t maybe it was just me this isn t in the instructions but I found more success when I used the analog stick in conjunction with the L1 and R1 As the game begins you are in your mansion facing a hail of gunfire from enemies At the top of your balcony you must shoot enemies Then came my first moment of oh this isn t as much of a free world at Grand Theft Auto when I tried to descend the left side of the staircase I couldn t get down it It s like there was an invisible forcefield Perhaps you need to kill a certain amount of enemies before you can descend down the left stairs I made my kills and then descended down the right side of the staircase to take on the remainder of the enemies There is a function named blind rage that comes out when you press a button on the controller This function makes Tony temporarily invincible When he dies on the screen it says You f cked up That is just one example of the cursing in the game The F word is used so much in this game that as an adult I wish there would have been a filter to change the language setting I literally had to play the game on mute because of all of the foul language Scarface The World is Yours is a fun game if you like violent games I will point out that as a gamer Rock Star Games has spoiled us terribly In Scarface The World Is Yours you pretty much have to stay on the mission or there isn t much to do In the past five years the Grand Theft Auto series has given us the ability to perform street races visit the shooting range import vehicles gamble dance work out or just walk around and mess things up when we aren t on a mission In Scarface The World is Yours you basically have to stay on mission There isn t too much extra to do when you aren t on a mission Sometimes as game player I get tired of shooting so much and just want to take a break and do something different I strongly suggest buying the Prima Games strategy guide It definitely unlocks the full potential of the game Scarface The World Is Yours overall is a fun game but it still doesn t give the game player that total free open world experience that some of the GTA games do But yeah get the strategy guide it gives the player something to look forward to 
Great Game This game is truly worth the wait It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in The cars handle great and are a blast to drive The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome This is a must get game 
A Totally Fun and Insane Game This game is not for those who like realistic driving games but that is why I like this game so much This game is insanely fun Doing tricks and stunts with a truck flying through the air off jumps and boosting It is just tons of fun You can also get points for ramming your opponent off the road and having nice crashes This game and the tutorial learning how to use the controls is not hard to learn at all The driving is very intuitive Anyone can play it When you turn the Wii reomte controller sideways then you can use it as a steering wheel You then can steer the truck by turning the controller as if you are steering a car I would have to say besides the new Zelda Excite Truck is my favorite game to play on the Wii so far Just remember when purchasing this game the graphics are not as intense at the XBox 360 or the new PS3 But the action is fast and fun I highly recommended this game for anyone purchasing the Wii 
Fun and entertaining but a little too easy I enjoyed most aspects of this game and it quickly becaming addicting There was great satisfaction is beating people up and plenty of opportunity to fine tune my skills Overall though this game was definately on the easy side Compared to the Grand Theft Auto games of which I was never able to complete I finished this one in just over a week The final challenge was particularly simple and I really expected more Still I d recommened this game however rent it don t buy 
A lot of fun but too short and too easy This game was a lot of fun you can do so much and the dark humor was great The only gripe I have is that it was just way to short and easy I easily beat this game in about 3 days and I still have 2 days left on my rental I would say rent this game because you can easily beat it within a week So overall here is a break down of the Pros and Cons Pros Playing pranks on students The missions are a lot of fun The side missions are also a lot of fun bring more to the story Good Dark Comedy like all other Rockstar games Unlocking funny constumes like the black ninja costume to stay out past curfew All the different Cliques were great and being able to beat up and bully anybody is a lot of fun Cons Just way too easy the missions can be beaten very easily Incredibly short nothing like the Grand Theft Auto Games where it can take a month to unlock everything I was able to unlock everything in 3 days Would ve loved to see some of the same things from GTA SA in Bully EX In GTA SA you are able to have gang members follow you and do what you want It would ve been great to see that in Bully Overall I would suggest renting a lot of fun but easily beaten not worth 50 
School Days Aren t Always Fun and Happy People can pick on the Rockstar group for their Grand Theft Auto series but I actually found the Bully game much more redeeming You re a schoolboy taking on the stereotypical cliques It s pretty clear why you re a depressed teenage boy when the game starts Apparently your dad has died and your mom has remarried an elderly grumpy old man who wants you out of the picture Your mom is more than happy to dump you off at a stay all year school while she goes off with Mr Moneybucks On top of that the school officials are pretty nasty to you right from the start Hogwarts this is not Then as you go into the run down dorm other kids start beating up on you It s time for you to stand up for yourself and make a stand There are various groups of kids in this school the nerds the jocks the greasers and the preppies Activities you do raise or lower your respect level with each group You have to go to class too and be there on time If you re able to manage your schedule properly you can participate in some pretty fun mini games the word scramble can be challenging to earn you new skills There are girls to court and usually they want a specific item So you have numerous quests to go on The bully activities range from escorting a nerd safely to his locker to running races and protecting yourself from attacks You get clothing along the way and can customize your look within school regulations of course It s a bit depressing sometimes to see how these mid teen guys treat each other but this does actually happen in many schools I m sure pretty much every person who was once a teen can name the cliques that existed in their school The graphics are rather good for a PS2 and the sounds while again a bit depressing for a teen environment work well with the game too On one hand I can not really like the swearing in the game but certain teens do in fact swear far worse than this game does I d even say this is more like Fable than other Grand Theft Autos with some of the ways that you can choose how you react in situations This game won t be enjoyed by people who are squeamish about violence it does after all involve teen guys all bashing each other for very inane reasons It also involves a lot of bullying as you might imagine Still if you can deal with those issues you ll find a really involving game that might actually make you think about how to treat others well 
An interactive twist for the Law Order crowd This is unique game that takes a keen eye and the ability to remember small details Many times whether or not you re successful will depend on how good you are at finding inconsistencies in testimony or things that just don t sound right The animation is very lo tech where each scene is just a stationary backdrop If there is a character you are interacting with they will cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states as it suits the dialog There is a LOT of reading and unfortunately some of the characters love to talk The music is simple and infectious the interface is easy to navigate either via touch stylus or buttons and you can save your state in the game at any time so you can take the cases at your own pace It s a unique game that is just a rewarding as it is frustrating The characters are interesting and if you own a DS this game is worth having 
One of the best for the Nintendo DS This game is a lot of fun From the start to the end you will be sucked into this game and will not be able to put it down Interviewing witness s finding clues cross examinations in court There is a lot to do and it is fun and invigorating Buying this game will not leave you dissapointed only wishing for more 
No objection needed for this game Just to add my 2 cents to an already glowingly reviewed title a couple more clues as to how well received this game was 1 After selling through the initial stock Capcom stopped shipping copies of the game An uproar from the gaming community ensued and existing copies started selling for 2 3 times the SRP in online auctions before Capcom announced that they will ship more copies 2 At E3 there was a trailer revealed for a Phoenix Wright sequel on the DS which is the sequel to the original game in Japan but will be titled in the USA as Justice For All If you are up for unconventionally written games with quirky charm this is a fun title to sit back relax and laugh with 
Games like this make the DS the 1 handheld Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney is a fun game It s that simple Graphics 4 out of 5 I would say the graphics are on par with most DS games They could be better but they don t retract at all from the gameplay They are fun and in the same style as games like Sprung and Under the Knife Audio 2 out of 5 The audio is where most DS games fall short I am content with the graphic abilities of the DS because quite simply the graphics don t make a good game Sure they help but the gameplay is were the entertainment truly lies It s knowing this that has kept Nintendo on top in the handheld market I just wish that the DS had a little more power behind it for the audio s sake I would like speaking characters throughout an entire game especially a game like this And the music is so repetetive it got to be so annoying that I found myself just turning the sound completely off I guess they do the best they can for what they have to work with but in this case it s just not good enough Gameplay 5 out of 5 As far as the gameplay goes you couldn t ask for a much better experience You are put in the role of Pheonix Wright who in his first trial is defending his best friend who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend Eventually you go on to work other cases and along the way you are required to gather evidence to use in court to suppport your defense The characters are over the top and a lot of fun to interact with This is a text based game and I suppose you might have to be a fan of the genre to really appreciate it But it s a simple pick up and play game that held my attention from beginning to end I really had trouble putting it down While a game like Sprung got a little monotonous and came down more to memorization then common sense questioning Phoenix stays on track in that area and logic plays more of a part in the solution of the cases I highly reccomend this game 
playstation 2 black dualshock controller Bought a few months ago and It is brand new in company package works great smooth black 
Good quality controller Since i bought my PS2 I ve never got to buy aditional controllers but everything has an end so i had to buy new ones The first thing i did was to buy one of those controls in a store of my country i don t know where they where manufactured i guess they were copies i m not sure but they did t work one month after So i took the decision to buy this ones they are perfect i strongly recommend this product 
help needed can somebody tell me if a PS1 DUAL SHOCK controller works on a PS2 thank 
was exelente He was exelente but I continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the Spanish on the item Thus they tendrian but trade here in Venezuela without but one takes leave of you Emerson 
awsome controller people plz ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable 
Doggies and Cats and Sims Oh My I have all the Sims and Sim s 2 products and each one is more fun and more involving than the last The addition of pets and the abilities to create custom pets is very amusing and it adds a whole new dimension to the game The new items that are included in the Glamour Life expansion set are great additions to the game as well 
No new Kitchen Stuff kidding right No it s not a joke This is the first expansion pack I ve bought for Sims 2 and that was my first thought as I was trying to find all the new stuff it adds It does add some nice things mostly couches chairs art tables beds and clothes and some new colors of shag carpeting which are awesome I also like the new dresses and the dressers The original Sims 2 just offers those space guzzling amoires Another addition you ll see is you can now influence people to do things It made my game immediately run slower then before but I m sure it s nothing that cleaning my hard drive won t cure As other reivewers have suggested it s a nice pack but overpriced right now 
Wow This is awesome After 8 hours of play so far I have gotten a lot more enjoyment out of this game than I did when reading the first three books of the series which themselves probably took less than 8 hours to read Where shall I begin describing this really fun game 1 The characters themselves are realistically animated and the Sunny animations are especially amusing with the way that she bites things squeals does little dances etc I ve smiled and laughed a lot just at how well the characters were represented 2 Voices are very good including the use of some of the major actors appearing in the upcoming film although their use is not pervasive during normal game play 3 The scenario is great fun far more involving than the books so far Playing the piano to break it apart and get it open was a real riot The settings are creepy with little roaches crawling about and rats and spiders and such 4 The game reaches the level of art Who did the soundtrack The music is AWESOME and wondrous After the dingy mansion of Count Olaf there are episodes of light relief that fill the player with a sense of peace and wonder the Library scene Uncle Monty s House and Garden The Garden with butterflies flapping by grass blowing wondrous music playing and the Big Tree adventure with Klaus flying over the greenery rivers etc finally made me see this video game as reaching a level of artistic accomplishment like a good painting to just get lost in and enjoy all the details and sensory input Wow And at first I was concerned that I might get through the game too quickly After 8 hours though and only being midway through I know I m getting my 40 worth for I will surely play through the whole thing more than once just as one watches a favorite video or takes a hike along a favorite forest path I calculate that at about 2 per hour this game is giving a far better return than seeing the film in the theater when it comes out although I plan to do that too And that s not even counting the game s resale value afterward In addition there are some special game features that tie in with the film with players eventually awarded with film photos information A V from and about the film One extra note to game players is that I don t think players will get a great deal of benefit from the BradyGuide to this game That game guide is poorly mapped and far from comprehensive while the instruction manual that comes in the game itself gives enough instruction and detail to allow players to start and proceed Save yourself 15 by avoiding the BradyGuide because a map you make yourself while playing will likely be far more useful Halfway through the game so far I only got about two useful tips from that guidebook and I would have figured those clues out on my own anyway 
Lemony Snickets Series of Unfortunate events Ecellent best game ever Educational but fun Scary and enoyable graphics perfect and has a long lasting story line 
The Best I ve been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me San Andreas has got to be the best one For the first time you can swim I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character The graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you ll get used to it The language is terrible more so in this GTA version so young kids should avoid this like the plague 
a reason for its popularity There s a reason everyone loves this game there s a lot of exciting action The popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it s almost ridiculous Driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game It s a game you have to own if you re a fan of video games 
Killing people never gets old How do you follow up a runaway success like 2001 s Grand Theft Auto III Rockstar North responded a year later with GTA Vice City a game that took the gameplay of its predecessor and expanded it considerably At the same time Vice City gave the series an extensive and amazing stylistic makeover drenching the experience in the sights sounds and attitude of Miami Florida from the mid 80s So where do you go from there You take it statewide Grand Theft Auto San Andreas expands the series concept to encompass three entire cities as well as the countryside between them The gameplay similarly expands packing in some explosive set pieces and amazing action movie like thrills while maintaining that same remarkably fun freefom GTA feel In short Rockstar has done it again San Andreas definitely lives up to the Grand Theft Auto name In fact it s arguably the best game in the series Just when you think you re getting used to gang warfare everything goes sour We re certainly not interested in spoiling the game s many interesting plot twists so we ll leave out the details but it should suffice to say that you ll eventually need to get the heck out of Los Santos You wind up in the country outside the city where you ll encounter many more great characters and officially embark on your quest to put right what s gone wrong Once you get out of Los Santos you won t really have to worry about gang warfare for a while and the game settles down into a more GTA like feel Like the previous games in the series San Andreas features a fairly linear story that takes you through the game s areas You ll start off restricted to Los Santos something the story justifies by claiming that an earthquake has taken out the bridges and roads that link Los Santos to the surrounding area but it doesn t take long to unlock the other two areas The game also throws in some pretty great surprises in the form of characters from previous entries in the series These characters tie the GTA games together really nicely so while San Andreas feels pretty different from the other games in the series it still feels like you re playing in the same universe The game also tracks a lot of other statistics Respect is a big one as it s what you ll be earning the most of as you complete missions Not all missions earn you money but almost all of them are good for a slight respect bonus A higher respect rating lets you recruit more and more gang members to follow you around and shoot at rival gangs which is another new addition and a nice perk but not something that comes in handy very often You re also rated in a lot of different vehicle categories like driving riding motorcycles bicycling and piloting aircraft As you use a vehicle your skill with it slowly increases which seems to tighten up the controls a bit In the case of motorcycles it also makes it less likely that you ll fly off the bike in a wreck Your bicycling skills translate into higher bunny hops Similarly you re given stats for every type of firearm in the game You ll start with poor skills with all weapons but don t let the tag of poor fool you CJ s skills feel roughly the same as Tommy Vercetti s when you first squeeze the trigger After getting in some time with a weapon you ll upgrade it to gangster level which extends your lock on range with the weapon speeds up reloading and in some cases lets you walk around while locked on Upgrading your skill with a weapon to the highest level hitman takes a relatively long time but it extends the lock on range and speeds up reloading even further and it also opens up the ability to dual wield some one handed weapons Unloading two full clips of submachine gun ammo is extremely satisfying here Just like in all GTA games the thing that makes GTA go up and over the freedom to walk around a huge map doing whatever the hell you want to do You dont just have to do the missions half of the fun is wandering around and killing people Usually when a game tries to do a million different things it s an overambitious hodge podge that can t manage to get its different parts down cold Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has you doing many many more things than any previous GTA game and while some of them do work a little better than others the strength of all these different gameplay elements too many to count makes for a powerful package that does not disappoint despite the extremely high standards that Grand Theft Auto established and that San Andreas needed to live up to With its strong story well written dialogue terrific voice cast impressive graphics great in game sound and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn t be missed 
THE BEST GAME EVER This is the best game in the world Its really cool you can make him fat by eating food over and over again And the missions are very challenging but fun I really do recommend this game and i really recommend you to buy it The game is really lifelike And the graphics are very good This is the best game i own and i own ALOT OF PS2 GAMES There are 100s of cool fun things you can do in this game The cars are very cool You can go shopping you can buys houses get jobs and even have girlfriends you can even take karate and loose weight or gain weight or work and stuff they have San francisco san ferro las vegas las venturas las angeles los satos etc And many more towns they have lots of cool things to do in this game and you will have to buy it to find out I REALLY RECOMMEND GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS GET THE GAME TODAY I PROMIS YOU WILL LOVE IT 
good game this game is better than madden by a nose but could be better gameplay is better than madden i think 
Pretty Good Game Except For A Few Modes This game is great I mean it might be just like last years game and all but still it s pretty cool I like the graphics They don t show great detail but they suffice The new momentum meter is nothing special It doesn t help you or anything It just tells you who s doing better in the game The new emotions expressed by the players really helps you to know the tempo of the game One thing that is sort of a CON this year is the Campus Legend mode That s really the only reason I bought this game I really don t like a college football team well enough to have a franchise with it I do like CSU though so I might try it But anyway Campus Legend mode lets you do the normal thing Pick your position for instence You get to do lots of drills for your position this year Good to some bad to most Also you have to pick a major to do WHAT S UP WITH THAT I mean college football is rough enough but to have to study for a major UNBELIEVEABLE Then they expect you to remember all of the stuff you studied and take two tests on it each year I got so frustrated that I was failing chemistry that I started to write all the answers down So I m doing better now Trust me though this game is fun to play random games with your college team or a guess a franchise with your favorite college team but please if you want to make an all star football player just go out and but NCAA Football 2006 Way more easier 
Guitars Trumpets Tubular Bells Whistles and yeah GUNS Years ago when I saw the coming soon posters for this game I passed because of Rockstar s rep in the Grand Theft Auto genre I didn t want to patronize a company exploiting the deperate parts of inner city life Then I found out Red Dead Revolver had an authentic okay lifted spaghetti western soundtrack That was the dealmaker for me If you like the music of the films get it get it get The dwarves are just gravy to the story and the music 
Western Gaming at it s best Red Dead Revolver is by far one of the best Western games I ve ever played The game has an easy learning curve also After an hour or so of play you will have all the controls down and you ll be hooked or otherwise very interested It has one of the best story lines out of any other games I know Basically a Western tale of revenge on a renegade Southern General and his Colonel You play as Red Harlow whose father was brutally murdered right in front of him by Colonel Darien again General Diego s right hand man I wouldn t say this game is as bad as the rating makes it There is no actual dismemberment as the rating for Blood and Gore says and the use of curse words is kept to a minimum If you ve seen any PG 13 Rated movies the two could relate It s a fun time killing game if you re bored with great replay value for people who don t plan on finishing the single player modes There are tons of characters to choose from in the multiplayer mode both good and bad The multiplayer modes are numerous also including things like Showdown and Dueling modes The downfalls of this game are the short Story mode and the overall simpleness of it There aren t many ways you can get creative with it But the greatest thing about it I believe is The sheer Hilariousness of it Me and a friend sat and played it for more than 4 hours at night once and sat holding our sides crying because of laughter The midget clowns and the character reactions are funny Especially how it sometimes glitches up Once during a boss fight with a very fat character the fat enemy got hung in a stairwell because he was too big to go through it An Overall VERY GOOD game You should buy this and if you like this game you may want to purchase GUN too GUN copied off of Red Dead Revolver for the most part though Both games have very short stories too If you like a good Western and great replay value then you will certainy love Red Dead 
Entertaining highly amusing but too short This game was a long time in the making and given the cultural popularity of the Western genre it is surprising that a Western themed video game should take so long to come to market I had this game for a long time but only recently got to play it and when I finally got into it it was enormously entertaining and I loved a lot of the spaghetti western themed humor and musical score In the game you will control a variety of characters many of whom are introduced in the superb opening sequence which plays much like the opening credits of a Sergio Leone western Most of the time you will play the part of Red Harlow a half breed bounty hunter on a mission to hunt down his parents murderers Sound familiar You ll also get a chance to control a variety of other Western archetypes such as the expert pistoleer English dandy the sharpshooting spitfire rancher s daughter the Indian cousin of Red Harlow who dresses like an Iroquois instead of a Sioux or other Plains Indian but I m nitpicking the Negro Buffalo soldier and you even get to play a bad guy when you assume the role of a renegade Mexican general The gameplay itself took a little time to get used to For instance to draw your gun you must press a button down and keep it held down while pressing another button to shoot If you let go of the button which draws your gun your character will holster his gun again This was one of the quirks which made for an initially difficult learning curve However once the controls are mastered combat is actually surprisingly easy You can duck hide behond cover dive roll and jump When guns are holstered you can even punch and kick and one of my favorite sequences in the whole game is the bar brawl more stereotypical western scenes where you cannot use your guns but must use fists and feet and occassionally broken whiskey bottles to fight your way to safety In addition to normal combat there is a showdown mode which is dedicated to quick drawing against one or more opponents The highlight for this feature is a tournament which seems inspired by the movie The Quick and the Dead where you battle ever faster enemies until you win This mode is sometimes very frustrating as you may have to replay again and again Overall the graphics are okay what helps make this title is the fact that the makers put in a grainy old style matinee look like the game was a movie being played on an old style and worn out projector complete with hairlines and picture moving off center at times This little touch was very endearing While this title may not have a lot of replay value it s still immensely fun and I would recommend it highly 
no bad good game this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49 99 buy this game cause they copied it 
Really genious idea The idea for a spy game was great and the game itself was extremely fun only it locked a lot It s not the easiest game but I liked it a lot 
Splinter Cell An excellent game You are in a darkened corner You watch as a patrolman descends the stairs You size him up noticing his AK 47 is drawn You quietly sneak up behind him and when he stops walking you grab him You place your silenced pistol up to his forehead and drag him into a darkened corner Another guard walks into the room You quickly turn your pistol towards him shoot then turn back to your hostage You quickly hit him in the back of the neck knocking him out This is a great game It was made in I believe 2001 and yet the graphics rival that of games such as Halo 2 The physics of the game are amazing and it is very well programed Your guns drop shells which stay on the ground breifly and bullets leave holes on walls Guards will notice you if you are too loud and if their comrades are sniped they will sometimes open fire even not knowing where you are You can knock out kill or avoid enemies The graphics like I said are amazing The fire looks very realistic and the lighting is perfectly done People look realistic not quite so much as the scenery but even in games like Halo 2 people are not the focus Missions change greatly and environments change with them The dialouge isn t great but it is decent and if you dont play too close attention to it it is a nice backround noise All in all if you have one game to buy buy this one 
A New Breed of Action Splinter Cell is the first in a series of three amazing games to date It is available for the XBOX PS2 Game Cube PC and Game Boy Advance Set in 2003 you play as Sam Fisher an elite operative gathering intelligence for Third Echelon a top secret initiative of the NSA National Security Administration You work alone during your missions with the support of a remote team who periodically feed you info and guidance throughout the missions If you are caught by the enemy your country will deny your existence and any connection to you Like a sliver of glass small sharp and nearly invisible you are a Splinter Cell Splinter Cell is now highly renowned as being the ground breaking game that introduced the world to true stealth gaming Light and shadows are the key elements in the game and play a vital role to your success Unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing in Splinter Cell you must be tactical in your approaches and slip by your enemies as if you were never there creeping around in the shadows is the best approach However sometimes you will be seen and have no choice but to eliminate any witnesses After doing so you should then elect to hide the bodies in the shadows as not to alert anyone of your presence Causing a panic can easily create a real mess that will sound alarms and quickly end your mission in a bad way This play with light and dark is very well executed and amplifies the immersive qualities of the game Even now years after its initial release Splinter Cell is still worth picking up and playing In fact I originally purchased Splinter Cell for the Game Cube to take advantage of the exclusive connectivity features which enable the player to use sticky cams and have a tactical map displayed on their GBA which is very neat by the way Only after playing the two following Splinter Cell games Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory on Xbox did I then decide to buy the Xbox version of the original Splinter Cell I played through all of the missions again this time including the exclusive downloadable maps from Xbox LIVE and found it to be even more enjoyable than the fist time around Splinter Cell is a truly classic and timeless game that should be in every gamer s collection 
splinter cell totally awesome my favorite game ever the sound is revolutionary the graphics are top notch it is so real you ll freak although the PS2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics so i would buy the PS2 version if I were you A must own for every gamer it will change your life 
Splinter Cell When I first played this game I was shocked Just of how good a stealth game could actually be Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies Its really fun also suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game You only use two guns during the whole game the pistol and the rifle that has attachments Good stuff All you need is that and you can take out a whole building full of enemies You have to crouch and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released I highly recommend this game Great storyline and the last level is hecka hard 
The amazing stealth action game that started the revolutionary Splinter Cell series Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is an amazing game that has completely changed the way people look at video games but also the stealth action genre for that matter The game is truly too good for words the only word that is even good enough to describe it is masterpiece That is truly what it is a masterpiece because of its seamless integration between stealth tactics and adventurous action There are no other games in the genre that offer the style of gameplay that Splinter Cell offers It is a unique gaming experience that you have to play to believe The core gameplay at the heart of Splinter Cell is revolutionary a style that has never been put into a game before The game puts you in the boots of American super spy agent Sam Fisher As Fisher you will go deep behind enemy lines to operate in top secret covert operations You must remain hidden and not be seen or captured otherwise the U S government will claim no knowledge of your existence As you gain experience operating as a super spy you will soon learn that opening fire on enemies and making noise will only cause an alarm to be raised which will simply put all your enemies on high alert and will probably get you killed soon enough So instead of run and gun gameplay Splinter Cell forces you to use stealth tactics which pretty much means to stick to the shadows and avoid being seen and if you must kill your enemies to complete your mission objectives be sure to do it silently In order to silently eliminate enemies you must sneak up to them without making noise Then after grabbing them you will have the option of interrogating them or forcing them to cooperate with you and then you can either kill them or knock them out It seems like a simple concept but it is a lot harder than it seems You won t just be able to blaze through levels and complete your objectives in a matter of minutes The missions are extremely challenging and you will end up replaying missions again and again In order to survive you must learn how to operate silently and in the dark without being seen or detected This is when Splinter Cell s stunningly amazing graphics come in handy Not only are the characters in the game each meticulously detailed to have ultra realistic physics and true to life animations but the environments are extremely realistic and full of life The shadow effects are one of the main highlights of the game Not only are they there for looks but they are actually directly integrated into the core gameplay They are actually a necessity for your survival as they help you remain hidden and invisible to the enemy Overall the graphics are stunningly amazing and look unbelievably realistic and extremely true to life The sound is simply icing on the cake It brings the amazing gameplay and the stunning graphics to life Ubisoft has always been a company known to take full advantage of Dolby 5 1 and Splinter Cell is no exception especially in surround sound The game shows off every single sound from Fisher tip toeing in the dark to the pop of your silenced pistol to the pounding of enemy fire being shot at Fisher it is all simply unbelievably realistic At first I was skeptical at purchasing this game because I didn t think I would like its stealth based gameplay considering I was more of a Halo fan But much to the contrary I had absolutely no problem paying 50 for this game when I purchased it when it was first released because of the hours of enjoyment I got out of it and the hours of fun I still get out of it today The bargain price of anywhere from 10 to 20 is definitely worth the money Even though there aren t a whole lot of features in the game besides the outstanding single player campaign it is still definitely worth the money considering how many hours of enjoyment you will get out of Splinter Cell Splinter Cell has an amazing story running throughout the campaign It really pulls the action together and really makes it worth playing You will find yourself tearing through missions just to see what s going to happen next in the story This makes Splinter Cell one of those rare addicting games that will never leave your Xbox console until you complete it Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is a unique experience that no other games can compare to It s truly a one of a kind game that is so revolutionary in its gameplay that I can honestly call it a masterpiece With the stunningly amazing gameplay combined with its extremely realistic graphics and it s true to life sounds Tom Clancy s Splinter Cell is an amazing stealth action game that has changed the way people look at video games 
A not very well known gem Theres alot of rpg s out there that ppl stumble on or find with some research and this would be one of those By finding it I found myself to be one happy camper when I got it and got it going You can play this for a very long time or you can play this for a short amount of time but Im positive if your into dungeon crawl types you will love this one My favorite part about this particular game is not having to have a key chart sitting in front of me at all times to glance at to remind me of what key does what I hate games that have so many controls that you cant just PLAY them w o memorizing so many key strokes to even move much less play There is also active forums with lots of info for this game even though its not a well known game here in the USA All in all I recommend this highly Great graphics but you wont have to have a high end rig to run it There is already an addition to this out replay value is high on this one 
Not my favorite game This game was enjoyable enough but doesn t really hold my interest enough to go back to it It lags a bit on my gamer PC and has some minor errors but all that aside it just wasn t that interesting to me The game is of a good quality and may be perfect for other gamers so it is still worth a good rating 
Slow in the Beginning but Picks Up Immensly All right I m quite sick of seeing people hate on this game I am addicted to Black White 2 As soon as you get past the whole tutorial business it s a free for all There are a couple problems First this game will not run on any old machine It better be fast and have a good video card that supports pixel shading The sound is good After installation issues you get to the game When you first play the game the tutorials are extremely helpful I first played the game on a laptop and as stupid as the camera rotating sounded I actually needed to know how to change the view with my fingerpad mouse laptop Learning completely how to interact with the world without having to refer to a manual I think is really good When you replay the game the tutorials seem redundant but does anyone remember that the tutorials give you tribute in order to buy advances to your civilization Now when you re trying to aquire 1 000 000 tribute to get the volcano miracle every little tribute counts So bare through the tutorials again and quit whining If you are the type of person that likes simulations Any of the Maxis sim games any from the Civilization series for example this game is highly addictive I personally don t enjoy gore and violence every five seconds and appreciate the building the civilization part You truly do get to control how the game goes Plus after you win a land you can stay there as long as you like and grow that metropolis until the entire island is covered in your houses and buildings It s obviously not a casual gamer type of thing Beating the game is a challenge as it should be but at the same time it is intriguing and fun I just was sick of seeing people give it such bad reviews Leave Black White 2 alone Just because you aren t competent enough to complete this game or need to shoot something every five seconds doesn t mean this game is bad 
play it a few times before reviewing plz stop doing reviews over how bad it is with to few options cuz it just simply isn t that way Yo can fire flaming people with catapults and or let you creature throw a flaming guy in the middle of an army so the middle of the army willl be on fire You just need to be creative Think like what will happen if I teach my creature to pick up a army guy set him on fire and than throw in the middle of a thightly builded city This game has many options but you ll have to create these options This wasn t really a review but a comment on other reviews who are saying that is boring and dull etc With this game you have to make it fun with your imagination 
Fun when it would run First off all the patches driver updates they recommended did not stop this game from crashing my PC something nothing else has ever done during every game session I have the ATI card they desired met the standards There was no online support other than reading what was already written Yet this game was enjoyable enough for me to play it at every opportunity rebooting as needed until I completed it Age of Empires 2 has been the only other PC game that has hooked me You will note as you begin this game that it has humor and in some ways is targeted for a teenage audience I think people of almost all ages can get a kick out of this unusual RPG game Have you heard of Populous It was a Playstation game where you were a goddess looking down controlling your tribe making sure towns were built and defended and throwing out some magic of your own B W2 reminds me of it except here you also have a creature your own pet that you help raise train through reward punishment I like that we are given a choice of 4 to choose from also There is enough freedom in this game to concentrate on fighting or city building or both whichever is your preference There are also little side missions that are optional to complete but give you more money to buy things They are puzzles to figure out Each land has a level and the game actually can go quickly especially after the 3rd land Your first enemies and last are the Aztecs which taunt you in the background while you play The 2nd are the Norse and 3rd the Japanese After you have completed all the levels the game lets you start over on level 3 with the Norse but now you have all the fancy buildings to impress them with and all the magic too Your creature is full grown and battle hardened This makes it almost too easy the 2nd time I have the Creature Expansion to this game on the way I hope it will be written to be more compatable with my PC 1 8 AMD XP w 2 HD s 1 gig ram This game is worth a try if you like city building or RPG 
Wireless network adapter Expensive but worth it it just works No more wires 
A little trouble to set up but overall brings a great experience I enjoy having wireless especially with broadband I have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong Set up is easy for most Although if you have a Linksys router WRT 54G ver 2 get ready for some work It took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice Since then I have not had any problems A little expensive but worth it in the long run 
Easier than many alternatives I was using a basic Linksys wireless game adapter with my 360 and it worked fine However it needed to be connected to a PC for firmware updates making it impossible for Mac users and was generally more difficult to set up than the official adapter from Microsoft I ended up getting this adapter on sale and setting it up was a snap It gets decent throughput and saves some energy over an external adapter because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on It was also nice to see that this supports WPA networks If your time is valuable to you this is probably worth the extra few dollars over similar products You just snap it on enter your network s password and you re off 
network adaptor i love having the wireless network adapter but i was truely pissed when i saw it cost 99 99 Microsoft just trying to rip you off for something you basically have to own 
X Box What s that There are two major factions when it comes to video games and if you weren t aware of their existence I ll be happy to illucidate for you Group 1 and by far the most numerous are the console gamers Group number 2 the one to which I subscribe is based on PC games I ll be the first to admit that as a PC gamer I tend to view consoles with suspicion as my experiences are that they place looks flash and hefty price tags above gameplay and plot The console audience tends to be younger than the PC group and these are the very aspects which appeal to them So it was equal parts hesitation and excitement that I felt as I put this game onto my hard drive For those not in the know once upon a time back in the early days of Microsoft s X Box there was this nifty game called Halo and my how the console gamers snapped it up I saw the commercials on TV of course and thought it looked pretty good but felt it too bad that it was an X Box title and not one available on my trusty ol PC Halo puts the player squarely in the armored shoes of Master Chief a one of a kind super marine engineered to bring the big guns on the Covenant a consortium of deranged religious aliens bent on the destruction of all of humanity No ship is allowed to go to Earth as it s location is a closely held secret which the Covenant wishes to possess at all costs But Earth is losing the war precipitating the creation of a new super soldier the Spartan II Just before the Spartan s were to be used on the Covenant s home planet the latter launches a surprise attack on the facility and destroys all but one You In a gambit to elude pursuit the last ship left the Pillar of Autumn jumps into hyperspace and ends up in orbit around a strange ringworld named Halo but are immediately attacked by their pursuers who seem to have tracked down the Autumn in no time Now complaint number one I have of this game stems from the fact that everything I just described is not taken from the game itself It comes from the game s manual A plot this interesting should at least have been included in the opening scenes C mon Microsoft you have the money pony it up to spruce up the introduction It s a good plotline so don t waste it on the manual which will only be kept in a desk drawer of some juvenile for the next 10 years and forgotten until next decade s spring cleaning Plot and first gripe now aside let s focus on the game itself I refuse to judge a game by it s age as too many do nowadays for instance I still play the original Half Life and think the plot and gameplay more than make up for the aged graphics The game looked fine on my PC and I never experienced anything close to screen lag The colors and contours of the alien world and ship hallways are nicely rendered and the sound and ambient noise are above average The music itself has nice choral sequences such as featured on the menu screen to downright cheap MIDI sounding music which felt out of sorts with the rest of the game The weapons selection is small but surprisingly good and for any given situation you ll likely have access to the weapon s needed to surmount it I particularly like the Plasma Pistol with it s supercharged shots as well as that everlasting mainstay of FPS games the shotgun The ability to drive vehicles is included in the game something that separates Halo from most other FPS s and it is a lot of fun In particular I loved driving the Scorpion tank which demolishes everything in it s path You can also fly around in an enemy Banshee light fighter which made getting past a couple of levels that much easier The game s plot flows smoothly and the voice acting is pretty good And now for the gripes Right off the bat I will say that level design has to be the single biggest detraction from this game Beautiful outdoor environments are used in this game but not nearly enough You ll spend most of it traversing hallway after hallway which connect to rooms that look identical to the one you just left Doing this 2 3 times is enough but when you spread out a level that runs outwards of up to 3 hours of the same thing it gets reaaaally stale Case in point in the chapter s in which you spend time with the Monitor traveling through the Library This section of the game was draining and seemed without end It wasn t fun just stressful The level in which the player is introduced to the Flood felt much the same although it was still a lot of fun Vehicles are fun but require the mouse to steer This obviously is a remnant of the X Box where players had to steer the Warthog with the control toggle thing but I found that mostly it had me skidding against walls and occasionally flipping The Ghost was the only vehicle I was able to use the strafe keys on to assist with steering The enemies themselves do tend to get a little stale after a while and during my first couple of hours of playing I wondered what I had gotten myself into The Grunts little pointy backed gnomish aliens spend most of their time running away and speaking an Ewok accented English It s very distracting and considering the nature of the other baddies they seemed a little out of place The lumbering Hunter who is super armored was also incredibly stupid At first I had trouble negotiating them but soon learned that by employing certain attack patterns I could easily waste one in under a minute The other aliens tend to use good combat tactics and I found dealing with them more difficult The plot itself which I classify as very good bordering on great kept me interested It ain t Half Life but it works well enough to have my curiousity piqued about Halo 2 which I might have to go ahead and buy in the near future I m sure that had Halo been released on the PC first which is what was originally intended it d have left a recognizable mark on the FPS shooter on that platform So that s that A very good game and one in which I look forward to the continuing storyline of Master Chief killer extraordinaire 
Can t touch this one but I want to What else needs to be said Even with a low end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN Perfect combination for a laptop notebook Too bad Sir William Gates won t allow a PC version of Halo 2 Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc 
Highly reccomended way to become socially reclusive Love this game Great story line Just make sure your computer can handle it 
Trust me I was a little worried about buying this game due to the mixed reviews on this website I found the official site for the game which to do that i googled the keyword Halo and when I went to their website you can download a free trial consisting of 1 single player mission and 1 online multiplayer level I m not one of those next gen gamers looking for the best graphics in the world and these ARE NOT the greatest graphics in the world but their enough to have a fun time All in all this is a fun game with awsome online capabilities This is definently a buy 
Multiplayer has good potential dies with bad community Aside from the instant impression that may be put on the reader of this review that I m reviewing this game only because of it s multiplayer singleplayer is actually what I look for in a game Multiplayer is just an extra to me however Halo was ported to the PC with online multiplayer in front of the mind Halo for the XBOX was originally intended to have XBOX Live multiplayer abilities but this feature never made it into the game Halo s amazing singleplayer campaign remains untouched which is a good thing If you are new to the Halo craze the story takes place between humanity and an alliance of alien races known as the Covenant After a narrow escape from an enemy fleet the USNC human alliance ship named The Piller of Autumn finds itself at a strange ring world that the Covenant call Halo When the ship is boarded by Covenant forces escape pods are launched and the ships surviving crew find themselves on Halo attempting to learn about it and uncover it s dark secrets while franticly fighting through armies of Covenant all the while You play as Spartan 117 known simpily as Master Chief You are a breed of super soldier created to turn the tide of a losing battle against the Covenant Stronger taller and better equiped than average marines you are a savior on the battlefield The game has 10 massive levels many with vehicles that are easy and fun to use while at the same time not forcing you to use them You can jump in and out of vehicles at will You can pick up any weapon lying around be it human or Covenant However you can only carry 2 weapons at a time not counting grenades You will encounter a few different species of enemy troops along the way such as Grunts Chunky little guys who don t do much damage even if they re in groups They do however use plasma grenades which will kill you 100 if it sticks to you If their forces are thinned or if the stronger unit that is leading them into battle is killed they will usually panic which sends them running around screaming Elites The backbone of Covenant forces elites carry plasma rifles higher ranking elites carry energy swords and deal out a powerful melee attack They also use an energy shield similar to yours making them equally difficult to kill They usually work in pairs or larger groups and can often be seen leading teams of grunts into battle Jackels These are back line troops They hide behind hand held energy shields and fire plasma pistols at you They can be dangerous in groups but they tend to shoot at you while you re fighting with other enemies and their shields are difficult to take down Hunters These are huge enemies with an extreamly powerful fule rod cannon the only weapon you can t pick up mounted to their arm and dish out a melee attack that sends marines flying Their armor is impossible to penetrate so you ll have to shoot them in their small exposed areas in between the armor plates They are always deployed in pairs as well You will also encouunter another race of alien spices later in the game that even the Covenant fear The graphics are now better than the XBOX version provided that your computer can run it at maximum quality If anything I just miss the XBOX controler Which is why I like the XBOX version of Halo better than the PC version With that Halo is still everything the XBOX version was only with online multiplayer battles Thanks to the people who play Halo s multiplayer however it s not very enjoyable I don t know what it is about Halo that causes it s online community to be mainly populated by 10 year olds who have never learned how NOT to swear in all caps every time someone kills them That s not the worst of it though Teamkillers Halo s multiplayer is COMPLETLY infested with them Every time you turn around in a team oriented battle a teammate is shooting you in the face If you re headed for a vehicle you should be on the lookout for a teammate who doesn t think that you are worthy of using it All the time If it wasn t for this it would be a great multiplayer game Another problem is that they didn t add campaign 2 player co op which was practicly the best part of Halo XBOX So your reasons to get this are A You don t have an XBOX but want to play Halo without having to spend an extra 150 B You prefer PC FPS games to console C You want good multiplayer but aren t bothered by the bad community D You can t stand to play a game unless it has the best possible graphical quality Overall Halo is hands down the best game I have every experianced I was a huge fan when it first came out on XBOX Though I still prefer the XBOX version PC is still great Compared to Call of Duty however the multiplayer fallsa little short mainly because of the people who infest it s online servers 
Awsomeness Action action and satisfaction Totally awesome and entirtaining This videogame will rock your world Cool new characters and weapons tactics and awsomeness 
STAR WARS at it s best I decided to buy STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO on Xbox for my son because he won t let me play my PC version Come to find out it seems like it plays easier on Xbox This game is by far one of the best I ve ever played It s awesome I find it very exiting and actually feels like being part of a combat squad Everyone in the team knows to be pro active rather than reactive I haven t seen a game yet where the squad members react to direct or indirect fire as these Commandos do it You don t move with your team they ll do their job You can also redirect their orders and they will follow orders to the letter Being able to inject them with Bacta makes the game a whole lot better that just finding a med kit and on the other hand while you re injured being rescued by your crew definitely gives you the feeling that you are a TEAM The only regret just a small one is that the game was so short or at least it felt like it It only has three major campains and with a game that is so much fun it seemed like time flew by I can only hope that LUCASARTS decides to make a Republic Commando II maybe based on the missions of OMEGA squad here s hoping I definintely recommend this game for Squad based combat or STAR WARS fans alike you ll get a kick out of it I m definintely a fan of Delta Squad Republic Commandos 
UNBELIEVABLE GAME This game rivals battlefront 2 for the all time greatest Star Wars game ver made This game is very similar to Halo in its 1st person concept w HUD Every level is different with lots of strategic tasks The graphics and gameplay are awsome I can t wait for this game to be 360 compatible 
Your not a Jedi In most starwars games your a jedi but in this one your a clone I that was cool You lead a squad around and give them orders like to attack a somthing blow something up or even hack a computer Unlike other games where your partners aren t much any help in this game your squad helps alot Also you don t have to do everything yourself you can tell your squad to do just about anything It is also fun to beat more than once and it s multi player is like Halo if you don t have xbox live I m thirteen 
No instructions When I got my republic commando game the instruction booklet was missing I didn t want to wait for Amazon to send me another game with a book so I pop the CD in my Xbox and hoped I d be able to figure it out on my own And I was able too there are a lot of on screen hints to help you get through the 1st couple fights But without the book I never did figure out how to get my men to search a room for me or destroy enemies for me as described in other reviews I did most of the killing myself and it took me awhile by pushing ever button on the control pad to figure out how to change weapons and reload Still despite not having an instruction booklet to help me I was still able to finish the games in 4 nights Things I like about the game the graphic were great like watching a movie I didn t have to fit the bad guys over over and over again you know like other games like episode III were you die 7 or 9 times before you finally defeat the big villian and the story line keeps you hooked Things I didn t like about the game was missing the book And it was over too quickly I would say it is an easy game to play anyone can finish it even if your not a big time game player I would recommend playing this game 1st to get use to 1st person battle game play before buying hard M rating battle games 
The WORST voice acting ever in a videogame I will begin by saying that this game is COOL SLOW MO ACTION PACKED Just imagine a mix of the movie Payback Hard Boiled Die Hard and Matrix and put them on a videogame This gameplay is like Metal Gear Solid but fast and with so so graphics The voice acting is HORRIBLE AND SILLY but funny at the same time Max s voice is a cheap rip off from Mel Gibson s voice and the game say stufs like this OH NO NO PLEASE GOD NO OHHH BABY NOOO PLEASE MAX I JUST NEED YOU YOU WILL DYEEEAR COOL ACTION MOVIES AND I TALKING ABOUT THE COOLEST OF THE COOL I don t know about angels but is fear that gives men wings I made like Chow Yun Fat OHH HUHUHUHU I FELL THE WRATH OF THE FALLEN ANGEL Maxy Maxy Maxy come out wherever you are I didn t like the way the show started they gave me the best sit in the house I hope you laught soo ADIOS 
Great with a few flaws I throughly enjoyed this game The voice acting may not be the greatest but I think the gameplay is really well done and the atmospheres are fantastic The controls take some getting used too and are not for everyone They are a problem and could have been better to control surprisenly I can do it very well The major problem I have is that as the game progresses it gives you less times to save so you have to go through almost an entire level though short and complete it WITHOUT saving once That is so stupid because if you die at the end you have to do the entire level over again that is the dumbest thing ever in a video game I just feel it s unfair for the game makers to make a fairly difficult level then make you do it over and over if you slip and die toward the end Stupid stupid stupid The levels can be a bit difficult if you re not one to be quick on the trigger And as much I gripe on the camera angles they re useful in stopping Max at the end a hall swing the camera around and see if an enemy is around the corner waiting on the steps right inside the next room etc It gives you a heads up and makes it easier to stay alive However I still really liked it I didn t enjoy MP2 as much but MP3 which should end the series I think should re SHOULD be much better I m looking forward to it 
Max Payne Prepared to be Enthralled and Annoyed From the commercials Max Payne was a third person shooter with a twist the twist being able to kill mobsters junkies and mercenaries in slow motion Truly one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you Aside from the slow mo Max Payne is essentially a third person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti hero Max Payne The story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game The jist of it is Max s wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he s on the hunt for revenge The plot widens thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game One can never tell who truly is on Max s side until the moment the credits roll at the end The bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion bullet time Gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision That brings about the issue with controls One of the cons of the game are the controls Many times have I fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making Max move just so to the right The heavy load times can also add to the agony especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way The game is definitely run on a sliding scale The chapters start out a cake walk and progress to a veritable teeth grinder At one point I was so fed up and enraged by the game that I had to go outside and take a walk If however you can take the time out to relax focus and be patient you should have little problem with the game As for guns there are lots of them And more ammo than you can handle Oftentimes you ll find a gun you really like and stick with it in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies That being said guns don t hold as much ammo as one would want especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds Max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself proof that he s not a guy to be messed with I personally was very much hooked on it The cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner soliloquies lifted from a Dashiell Hammett novel However simply put one will either love or detest this game I was reeled in by it but am very glad I ve beaten and seen the end of it However if you just cannot get enough Max Payne there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third even harder setting unlocked after those The game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging I wouldn t recommend picking this game up unless you re ready for oftentimes graphic violence innuendo and potty mouthery I also wouldn t recommend picking up this game if you re not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration It is however conquerable and you ll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges 
ummmmmmmmm Hunny you still playing I bought this for my husband um yep he s still at it He never touched and video game until I got him GT2 then 3 came out and he showed a little more interest Now 4 well lets just say He is on it when ever he gets time Cars lots of cars Tracts that will challege even the toughest driver So much to offer in a little CD package The image quality is so realistic that at times you have to make yourself remember that they are not real The places you can see and the roads you can travel wow is all i can think of knowing it hardly touches the beauty you will we see And going by how often I hear my hubby yell at the other drivers on the field shows me just how it draws you into its reality Well worth the price I think wonder if its my turn to play now 
Best car game ever This is THE GAME for race lovers awesome graphics car responce is just like the real thing photo lab is very nice too you can take pics of your rides you will never get bored of this game A must have 
Exelente Really it is a good game on war buy it since it he is very goo 
Gun Great Stoey Feels like you are in the old west But the Grafics are a bit slow All in all a Great Game 
Not Much To Say There is really not much to say about this kit however I think it is unfair that it received such a poor rating considering the only other reviewer s complaint that the kit is too expensive is inaccurate because the one he suggests is actually more expensive However this is truly a passport to an amazing gaming experience The Xbox Live experience is truly something innovative and relaly really fun and I would recommend buying an XBox 360 despite the next Playstation and Nintendo stations coming out However I also recommend waiting til after Christmas The rush to get these now is ridiculous and I have seen some consoles sell for over 800 dollars Why not wait til after Christmas when there will be an almost certain price drop to enjoy what this Xbox Live pack has to offer 
Xenosaga III Completely Unexpected The best story driven RPG Late one night after coming home from work I noticed a little package a package I thought would be another disappointment like Xenosaga II Even though I was in the middle of playing another story driven RPG I decided to give Xenosaga III a little test drive just to see what it was like never thinking I d actually find a game worth stopping all other activities and losing sleep over But I did Graphics BEAUTIFUL Every screen is unique and the game features locations you could just stare at and admire forever These locations have such an amazing amount of detail I have never seen in a game Imagine staring out at the ocean horizon with seagulls flying in the air with clouds floating past a beautiful blue sky on a sandy shore with palm trees bearing coconuts and the sound of the sea breathing into your ears Imagine yourself sitting in a futuristic nano cleaned park overlooking a vast futuristic city you can see twisting highways tall skyscrapers and hover mobiles all below a setting sun The graphics are stunning for the PS 2 Music One of the best RPG soundtracks I ve ever had the joy of hearing it fits perfectly with the serious and emotional tone of the game The soundtrack features many sad sombre themes complimenting their cutscenes as well as futuristically epic overtures that are matched with their cutscenes which portray tragedy and some unique to their boss battle themes which are fast paced and empowering Story If you re a nut for story based RPGs Xenosaga III is not to be missed this could potentially be the most favorite RPG of most of those who play it Xenogear fans Final Fantasy Fans Xenosaga I fans must play this game Otherwise you might be missing out on what could be your favorite game XS III answers all of the questions from the previous installments Gameplay Traditional turn based battles with tons of skills and techniques to master Earn experience points and skill points to customize your character through the skill tree Level up special attacks through constant use to make them even more powerful Use these special attacks to defeat your enemy to earn a large experience and cash bonus Xenosaga III is a work of art It hits the mark on all elements vital to a good RPG Story music graphics gameplay never before have I been so impressed by a game Xenosaga III is the perfect formula for future RPGs telling an engrossing epic story 
Xenosaga series I ve played them all and enjoyed them all Sorry this was the last one 
WOW I loved Xenogears and when it was known that they were going to bring out xenosaga I was so looking forward to it Well 1 didn t disapoint which led to 2 Then there was 2 well talk about a letdown Then the talk of 3 started At first I was unsure if I wanted to lay down any more money and be disapointed yet again But WOW am I glad I did It was a beauty to watch and play Many of the answers from games 1 and 2 can be found it breath taking cut scenes Im not going to spoil things for you but just to say WOW isnt enough to discribe the CGI s and twist and turns I just hope you enjoy this game as much as I have 
Best Game in the Series In my opinion this is the best game in the Xenosaga series The first game received a lot of well deserved praise and recognition However I believe this third game is better in just about every aspect The battle system is new and introduces the concept of Break The idea is to place your opponent in that state and avoiding it for your characters The turn based battle system is also very quick You don t have to wait 30 seconds for your characters to execute their battle moves The playable characters respond and attack as soon as you choose the type of attack that you want to perform As in the previous games you either fight on foot or aboard the giant E S humanoid machines Item and Equipment shops are back as well as the ability to customize your characters to a fine level You won t have as much options to choose as the first game but the ability is very close The best part of this game though is the story I am forty years old and have read many novels watched many great movies and played lots of video games In my opinion the story being told in this game surpasses anything that I have ever come across The plot is that good The characters are very well developed and seem to take on life as you play the game and watch the plot unfold There s action drama and revelations in just about every scene Each of the main plot from the previous episodes are brought to conclusion This is truly a masterpiece of story telling I can only hope that one day this very moving thought provoking captivating and uplifting story will be more accessible to people who don t play video games A lot of people will find it spiritual and philosophical Yes the theme is very serious and dramatic Unlike the more common whimsical theme of most games But trust me you will play for many hours non stop just to watch the plot unfold The concepts of destiny purpose free will choices life afterlife beliefs love despair and consequences are constantly present in the story The central character is Shion Uzuki the designer of the amazing android KOS MOS Allen and the rest of the supporting cast are back This time they are out to uncover a plot by Vector that could put the future of the universe in danger The mini game is there in case you want to take a break from the main story and enjoy a fun game of Hackox Ofcourse you have The Professor Jr and Allen to lighten things up just a bit also 
A Great Game Too bad its the last one This unfortunatly was the last Xenosaga Much inproved from Xenosaga II The game is playable once again It is nice to have some of the original actors and actreses back once again Momo was not fortunate enough to regain her original voice A few people are not happy about some of the scene editting from the Japanese to keep the rating of Teen in the united states but the ending was enough to make up for that For those fans who really liked the first and were disappointed with the secound that they did not finish it the game comes with a recap as long as your willing to read and you only lose Shion s Vector uniform for not having a cleared data file from Xenosaga II The only let down is that as a player we never get a chance to use Kos Mos Tertiary Weapons Those are the wings with the huge cannon seen in one She uses that cannon in one scene rather early on and then after that it is lost Like the first and secound this one has not only really strong biblical links but the resolution comes from people in the new testment No not Jesus All in all it is a great game and Shion s Speach at the end if your a sappy emotional person like me will leave you crying and that was more than enough to play through this game 
You ll love this game more than your own children Man I am sick of people mentioning the violence and cursing and sex that s in this game DUH This is as redundant as saying the sun is bright and hot I don t even see what the big deal is The gore in it isn t exactly realistic the blood splattering and gushing isn t that great looking and I ve seen much more disturbing games The violence is almost like cartoon violence in some ways It isn t really that big a deal There is some very moderate cursing and there s some sex Yes you can pick up hookers No you don t see any action Yes there s a strip club and sluttily dressed women but these aren t exactly real looking people Just lighten up If you don t want your 8 year old exposed to it then don t buy it for him but I better not see your hipocritical a buying him an R or even PG 13 movie This really is no different than watching some PG 13 movies and any R movie In fact they may be worse I think you should relax if the kid is 12 and that s being generous Now enough with that bulls t On to the game It s great What else do you expect You could play this game for hours and never get bored You can do whatever you want steal a car speed around town run over people do drive bys rob a store kill a person for no reason with a variety of weapons see how long you can evade the law do a mission do a sub mission such as the paramedic pick up a hooker and get some health etc etc etc There s plenty of side missions to do and those are what ll take up the most time not any of the storyline or asset missions The hardest ones are the paramedic vigilante firefighter Brown Thunder and Pizza Boy missions as far as I am concerned because there you have a time limit and if you re vehicle blows up you re f ked and have to start all over again You ll take a long time getting all the Hidden Packages Rampages and all that stuff but that s not so hard because it s not something that s really hard Just tedious There s also some race missions that are tough but they can be done with some persistence The controls are great The driving s excellent and so is the on foot ones The auto aim works easily enough though you sometimes target the ones you don t want to but you can get around this without too much difficulty The boats are harder to control though and the helicopters can be tricky But the boats are the worst since they have a habit of over accelerating and over steering But the controls in general are good enough so that you can pretty quickly get used to them and before you know it you ll be cruising around town like a pro The graphics are quite nice The cars are very realistic looking In fact after playing this if you go outside and look at real cars they ll remind you of the ones in the game You ll even feel like driving them like you did in the game But obviously you won t because you re not as stupid and f ked up like that guy who killed those cops and then like a p sy blamed the game for making him do it Don t listen to those a holes It s all a bunch of crap The only complaints I have would be on the people They could look better and the blood could be a little better too especially when it gushes from someone you shoot I would like to see more blood too The camera angles are the main flaw of the game Sometimes you ll want it to point in a different direction so you can see what you re shooting at Another problem is when you re in the helicopter That can get screwed up with you turn around and the angle has to catch up with you On foot if you re not auto targeting you you have a button to adjust the camera angle to where you re facing but when you re in the vehicles not so The only time this really is a problem though is in the chopper The sound is excellent Even the sounds themselves are nice You have great voice acting by some well knowns and even nonwell knowns but it s all fantastic The dialogue is fantastic too You ll hear people on the street talking amongst themselves and they ll do stuff such as tell you to move sometimes not so nicely when you park a car in the middle of the flow of traffic They ll scream and plead for their lives or even taunt you when you point a gun at them or attack them Your character will even say things to people like when he steals their car or kills them such as My need is greater than yours or It s only money It s great The humor value on this game is top notch and that has a lot to do with the sounds I mentioned above as well as how fun it is to kill people for whatever reason if there s a reason but also with the RADIO I can t believe more people aren t commenting on this This is one of the highpoints in this game just like on GTA3 only this time they don t make up all their own songs which is bad or good depending on how you look at it I love cruising around town listening to KChat VRock or VCPR that latter of which is the funniest of all I usually listen to these because they are the funniest talk radio is obviously funnier than music stations even though there is talk from the DJ s and call in listeners and the commercials and because I like rock music and they play actually good bands like Iron Maiden and Anthrax They do make up some of their own music I know they make up an in game band which you actually can do missions with called Love Fist a group of drunken Scotts But the radio is hilarious not just the talk radio but the commercials especially as well Knife After Dark Rated R for Retarded The game has some flaws but overall it s d m near perfect The makers of the game basically took all they did in GTA3 and added to it but failed to really fix these few flawss I mentioned But they re nothing in comparison to the overall fun this game provides There is at least over 100 hours even if you re familiar with the over all gameplay from GTA3 if you try to do 100 or at least something close to that I have no idea how I m gonna complete all those submissions Look this is one of the easiest decisions you ll ever make in your life Just buy the d m game And if that s not enough to convince you as one of the radio characters in the game Jeremy Robar says Just listen to these endorsements And remember these people volunteered They aren t being paid much 
We re taking over this town After playing Grand Theft Auto III I thought there was no way Rockstar could top themselves In fact when the advance word for this game got out I actually thought this was nothing more than an ADD ON for GTA3 Stupid thought I know on the whole GTA VC is bigger badder and more audacious than GTA3 ever was So here s the story In 1986 Tommy Vercetti a hitter for the Forelli crime family in Liberty City is finally released from prison Sonny Forelli his boss immediately sends him down to Vice City to close a major drug deal being handled by Ken Rosenberg a shyster lawyer and the Forellis contact No sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up kill everyone but Tommy and Ken and take both the drugs and the cash Now Tommy has to recover the money for Sonny but before long he decides to make a name for himself in this town The setting is pure 80s excess through and through If you take the bottomless amoral corruption of Scarface the day glo polyester fashion of Miami Vice and the innate cheesy greed of Ronald Reagan s 1980s American culture you ll have Vice City You ll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens the local architecture and the cars tooling around on the road You ll even hear it in the radio stations which boast an array of heavy metal dance Latino and bubblegum pop music the like of which you haven t even thought of since the 80s I swear try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories don t come flooding back The voice acting is as usual superb Ray Liotta did an outstanding job bringing Tommy Vercetti to life and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character And there are others as well Burt Reynolds Dennis Hopper Gary Busey Lee Majors Fairuza Balk and Robert Davi all turn in great performances But Philip Michael Thomas who played Don Johnson s partner Tubbs on Miami Vice gets special mention in more ways than one his character Lance Vance is the one to keep an eye on While the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself it s the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out it also adds length to the game and really makes you feel like you re establishing a criminal empire They re called asset properties At a certain point in the game you have the option of buying certain businesses Once you buy one of these asset properties and you complete its mission strand that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up Some of them are perfectly legitimate such as the taxi company or the nightclub Others are a little sketchy like the boatyard or the strip club but others are absolutely illegal like the protection rackets the ice cream company or the car showroom They add a great amount of depth and they let you establish contacts across town Needless to say once Sonny Forelli comes to town to check up on you make no mistake he s now in YOUR town So if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner Tony Montana book a trip to Vice City Like San Andreas it s a great place to visit and unwind and also like San Andreas you ll be glad YOU don t live there 
Great fun for adults I may not be the typical game player as a 36 year old woman but I love driving games and this is one of the best driving games ever for the PC There was something a little crazy about enjoying speeding through the Miami streets running over pedestrians taking missions as a hit wo man and eluding the law The game has definitely stirred up a lot of controversy but it s just a game an ADULT game I loved the whole 80s Miami Vice theme and one of the most enjoyable parts of the game is speeding around town listening to the awesome radio stations in the car You can also create your own radio station with your MP3s The graphics of downtown and the cars are great but the characters can be a little stiff at times However this does not detract considerably from the fun factor Some of the missions are too difficult and trying to get through them over and over again became so tedious that I had to find some cheats online A more liberal save feature would have been nice As a result of some of the missions I still haven t finished the game but perhaps that s the beauty of GTA Vice City it s huge and you get your money s worth There s nothing I hate more than buying a game and finding it so simple that I finish it in a couple of days there s no risk in that with this game 
A new look for the MegaTen franchise While Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Raidou Kuzunoha vs the Soulless Army isn t actually an SMT game it is a member of the franchise It is actually part of a family of spin off games in the MegaTen series that is just using the SMT name to establish connections between the different series in the franchise finally appearing in America While not too many people are familiar with the games past this one takes the series in a new direction Devil Summoner is the first game in the MegaTen franchise that has moved past the traditional or tactical RPG style combat and gone straight into the action RPG genre In this game you play as a young man who has just attained the title of Kuzunoha Raidou the 14th the successor to a long line of Devil Summoners tasked with the protection of the capital city With his ability to see and control demons Raidou must solve a mystery that becomes increasingly more and more twisted as the game progresses The story begins with the player earning the Raidou name essentially this is the tutorial and being assigned to work at a detective agency in the capital One day you get a mysterious phonecall from a girl pleading for help and wants to meet with you late at night Reluctantly Raidou and his partner at the detective agency head out to meet her They find out the girl who contacted them has an odd request she asks them to kill her Before anyone can respond she is kidnapped by mysterious men in red and so sets forth a tale of demons evil and curses Essentially the game progresses much the way you would expect a MegaTen game to you travel to different locations via world maps and explore the different locations on larger area maps While wandering around the areas searching for clues and information there will be several random encounters the franchise is known for high encounter rates that will allow you the opportunities to capture new demons for aid More on that later though While exploring the areas you are able to have a demon deployed to follow you around keep in mind the normal people can t see it though Every demon type has special skills that can be used in the areas such as flying to reach far items scouting to find hidden items and enemy info and even mind reading to get some extra information from people These skills are essential to getting the information you need so it is wise to keep a demon of every type as often as possible Now for the battles This is where fans of the series will either love the game or hate it Gone are the pressed turn systems used in Nocturne and Digital Devil Saga Instead they are replaced with real time action battles You directly control Raidou and can use combinations of sword strikes and gun shots to defeat your enemies Raidou can t use magic so the only way he can deal elemental damage is using special bullets Luckily for him though he is able to have a demon deployed with him in battle but only one It will typically act on its own but you are capable of assigning it specific orders or general strategies By using your monsters in battle they will grow in loyalty to you When their loyalty is maxed out they will often give you bonuses and can then be used in fusions to create new demons Essentailly the system can get a little bit repetitive and while it will takes a while to get used to once you do it becomes a matter of knowing what enemies are weak to which attacks Once you figure that out though it s just a matter of keeping your levels high enough and capturing and fusing demons to keep gaining strength The style of capturing is brand new as well Gone is the negotiation system used in Nocturne and the original SMT games Instead it is replaced by a system that forces you to exploit enemy weaknesses When you hit an enemy with an element it is weak too it will become stunned and give you the chance to capture it by repeatedly pressing circle until a meter empties out You must empty the meter before the creature revives or you will not capture it The easiest way to do this is to wear down its health ahead of time before attempting a capture One note though you will automatically fail to capture if the enemy is a higher level than Raidou the moon is full or it is a boss battle The graphics and music in the game are a little different from what was seen in previous SMT releases here in North America It still uses the same form of cel shading but they are a little bit more defined and detailed Nothing too major but it is enough to really change the visuals overall appearance from the other games Also this game is not as dark and gritty as Nocturne or DDS In fact it has several amusing scenes and is much brighter and more vibrant overall This is greatly illustrated by the music which is often much more lighthearted and is comprised of a lot of horns and brass instruments Not nearly as dark and brooding as the other two games But since this game takes place in 1920 s Japan and not a post apocalyptic world this time it fits in quite well Overall Devil Summoner is a new spin on an old franchise While it does display that full action battles aren t as well suited for the style of the game Atlus was able to do it well enough that it still remains fun and keeps the game enjoyable For a lot of people who found the turn based systems of Nocturne and DDS overbearing and cumbersome this could be a nice way to ease into the world of the MegaTen franchise While it is not nearly as epic as the previous games it holds its own and the story alone is enough to keep a fan of the franchise sated long enough to finish the game off regardless of whether or not they like the change of style Definately not the best game in the franchise but a nice refreshing change that is fun none the less 
great controller looks and feels great This is a very awesome controller It looks great and its wireless i have not had any problems I can lay on my couch 10 feet away and play without having to worry about accidently unplugging the controller because the cord is too short This controller is way better than the wired controller it comes with I recommend this controller to anyone who owns a gamecube I bought it at gamestop for 17 dollars used great deal Buy it now 
These are GREAT No wires For us the range has not been a problem and they work just like a normal controller The ONLY drawback is that the kids leave them turned on and the batteries need replaced As long as you don t use the rumble option the batteries seem to last a long time 
Great Controller NIntendo products are as reliable as ever I was very pleased at both the range and the battery life of the wavebird and realized how little vibration matters I would highly recommend this over any other wireless controller 
Mario in his best I have always loved Mario and when I purchased my new Nintendo DS Lite I bought this with it This game is absolutely amazingly fun The graphics sound and the game itself are incredible This game is good for any adult or child Although for a younger child it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating With this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again and possibly again after that But every time you try again you understand something new about the level and it really is fun There also are the features of becoming Mega Mario and Mini Mario which mixes things up every once and a while This game is wonderful definitely a great buy 
best nintendo DS game seriously This is the ultimate mario game super addicting you will want to play this for days on end beware I managed to beat the game in about a month but I can still unlock paths and you can always reset it and start over my daughter can play it she is 4 tells you how easy it is but don t let that fool you it can be a tough game the further you get The only negative point I can say is when you get to the final battle it is a little disappointing it only took me about 10 tries before I won either I am a natural at winning quickly doubt it or they made it too easy to win regardless stop reading this review and buy it you will thank me for it 
New Super Mario Bros I bought the game for my daughter but I play it more than she does This game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love Super Mario Bros 
Good When Playing I loved the game and the side scrolling was a nostalgic step back in time for me The game play was difficult at times Honestly I beat the a game in less than 2 weeks with a grad student schedule and immunology test in the middle Finishing everything completely all levels and all star coins was a challenge in and of itself But it reminded me of the GTA series because after you beat the game there is really nothing to do anymore in the mushroom kingdom The minigames are amazing time wasters I find myself playing them when waiting 5 minutes for other people etc I have had limited experience with the multiplayer but it was VERY fun of you have a friend with a DS Best feeling seeing the 3 stars next to my saved game and getting to level 176 of the where s waldo minigame 
Definitely New Not So Interactive which is ok I think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky Sort of like Mario 64 DS And like Mario Kart you have the 2nd screen as your map But you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want That s really the jist of this game when it comes to NEW features Someone wrote loosely based off the old 2D side scroller Marios but actually this is very much based off them entirely The only difference is that the environments and characters are in full 3D yet still side scrolling view Which is a nice touch watching the 3D models move around like that Other then that it s a nice update to the old classics Especially big Mario which you never do get much to play with thanks to the use of a giant mushroom And vice versa a mini mushroom that causes Mario to shrink and the only way to access the other levels by defeating the enemy bosses as Mini Mario There s also a new shell costume of which Mario dons but can quickly get out of control if you run to fast and he spins all over All in all it s a very fun game entertaining but not very hard which is good for the young folks but those reminiscent of the old days know how hard it was to beat a Mario game back then and this was surprisingly easy Luckily the game is packed with mulitplayer features and mini games to add to the value and they do Not all are entirely fun but the majority do make use of the touchpad and make up for not using it much throughout the game Playing 2 player will always be fun of course unfortunately it s not WIFI so you have to be within range of someone else with the game 
GTA3 RULES GTA III rules but its not the greatest game ever thats why it gets overall of 4 but it still is awesome but GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY RULES EVEN HARDER Xbox version is best 
Overall a great game but with a few additions I could do without The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games With creation of GTA 3 games became increasingly more violent and more controversal San Andreas is no exception If this game did not bear the GTA tag I probably would have rated it higher but needless to say I m a bit disappointed with what rockstar did with this addition to the GTA series Previous GTAs all had a quirky jab at political and social icons particularly conversation political and social icons San Andreas had this but to a much lesser extent which disappointed me Another thing which disappointed me about this game was the RPG like system they put into it Your accuracy is determined by how often you practice rather than the players ablity to shoot Also unlike previous GTAs you must now press a button and slow your walking speed down to manually aim and fire a gun I HATED this change in the gameplay This severely limits your ablity to go on rampages and forces you to use their god awful auto aim system If they had not added this function to the game I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more That being said there were PLENTY of things I enjoyed about this game First off I enjoyed the new depth theyve added to missions Previously missions were as followed Kill this blow up that run way from these guys and avoid cops Missions in this game actually feel like Rockstar put a lot of time into each individual objective One Mission that particularly comes to mind is the mission where you hop on a plane have a small shootout on the INSIDE of the vehicle then fly to liberty cities a location that you cannot travel to normally and assassinate some crime bosses Little things like this show the extra effort the designers put into the game Another thing I enjoyed about this game is that it is more challengeing than previous GTAs The very last mission will have you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing from the firetruck missions This game is designed at a skill level for someone who has been playing GTA a long time Also the map is friggin huge Its about 3 times the size of your regular GTA game However unlike previous GTAs its not packed with little goodies and have special jumps at every corner Its still fun to explore every corner of the map in this game though So now for the break down of my review Pros Incredibly large map Challengeing More new vehicles to hijack An overall improvement on the missions Plenty of extra features GANG WARS Good voice acting The Cons New style of shooting is a huge hinderance Areas are not as packed with goodies as before Fewer political cheap shots than SA s predcisours Overall I would give this game a 8 out of 10 in comparison to video games everywhere but only 4 out of 10 when compared to its predecesors 5 being average One other note If you have an ATI Radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game not with lag but with actually loading the game 
here is somethin you can t understand Not really being into the original GTA III and its birds eye view predecessors I became unfortunately addicted to to San Andreas The game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are despite the dated graphics engaging Maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations The game play is free ranging but if you don t pursue the main storyline missions which are linear but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with as it should be The moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions but for the most part there are repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so My criticism would be that there are not enough repurcussions for street violence because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging If you go on a rampage in a local store the clerks don t try to call the police or evade They instead just take a beating or a bullet The AI of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street The cops in San Andreas are corrupt but not that corrupt GTA SA definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for PC Some of the interface and in game menus are awkward and designed to be PS2 gamepad friendly Saving the game is a bit of a pain as well since you have to retreat to your safe house to save everytime A fun and engrossing game for adults but let this be known if you let your under 18 child play this game you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away Aside from the violence San Andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo and is probably not really suitable for anyone under 40 There is no safe mode or low gore level for this game like some other titles while the game is overly violent gore is minimal anyway 
Rockstar continues to move its biggest franchise forward at a steady pace with this the sixth incarnation of the GTA series The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas all within the enormous state of San Andreas The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90 s This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character s appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly The character s skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early 90s in California The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits expensive jewelry and trendy fashions Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos his physical fitness can also be changed The Grand Theft Auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different As the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess The graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time Nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill San Andreas in an orange tint and the game s color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties California culture The soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which San Andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that Rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music The expected genres can be found such as Hip Hop and Alternative Rock both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene However some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world s era Dance music and Funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it although too much choice is never a bad thing Making a welcomed return are the various radio station DJs who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations For those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format one public station holding discussions on the day s political events and another with light talk shows Either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the PC version gives you the added bonus of playing your own MP3 tracks by adding them to the game s music library The sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive There is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride All these things add a little bit of life to the game s large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that San Andreas contains The thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present The gunfire and explosions sound average with not much improvement present since Vice City Despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series San Andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself An engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect 
Incredible City Cludgy Controls At first glance the average person might assume that the appeal of Grand Theft Auto is in the graphic violence swearing and mature content but the truth is the GTA series is revolutionary technological achievement and remains one of the most impressive experiences you can find in gaming The first time I ever tried GTA Liberty City I was absolutely blown away by the size and scope of the fully realized living city It was the same feeling I got the first time I played Mario 64 in that I recognized that I was witnessing a major leap forward Now almost 10 years later Rockstar has treated us with their latest effort GTA San Andreas Liberty City was the prototypical big east coast city while Vice City was a combination of Vegas and southern Florida San Andreas takes gamers to the west coast with shades of San Francisco LA and points in between As always the city is gigantic and fully realized in a way that the True Crime series could only dream of In fact I noticed a billboard in San Andreas mocking True Crime GTA has always been about freedom the freedom to walk drive or bicycle wherever you want the freedom to walk up and pop someone in the mouth if you want Sure it s violent but consider it wish fulfillment for those of us with an inner anarchist who desires expression without the messiness of accountability The only other game that even approached GTA s scale was Mafia but Mafia was saddled by unforgiving law enforcement that wouldn t even allow players to run red lights Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and palm trees in San Andreas The vehicles are extremely difficult to control The problem is that the vehicle movement and camera angle work independently which means that when you make a turn using the keyboard you have to quickly swing the camera around using the mouse to realign yourself Even after considerable practice I still found it very challenging and awkward Shooting is likewise rather challenging to perform and I just don t remember it being this hard in the two previous games The other surprise was how taxing the game is on my PC I played the first two GTA on a significantly weaker machine and was surprised that I couldn t max out all settings on San Andreas I had to pull in the drawing distance significantly to keep the frame rate up while using a P4 3 0 GHz with 1 Gig of memory and an ATI RADEON X600 graphics card I have to knock one star off because of the awkward controls but GTA is one of those games you could spend a month on and never get board Just exploring the city is worth the price of admission 
Great game This game is great fun but why has one of the moronic reviewers decided to tell everyone the plot of the game IDIOT 
Definately Not Just A Kids Game Ok so it really ticks me off to know that I m near thirty and an 8 year old kid could probably destroy me on games like this but a friend of mine bought me this game for Christmas due to my obsession with Rabbits and I fell in love from the first tutorial level where you have to catch over a hundred rabbits with your BUN GUN I was hooked like a lab rabbit needing crack I was hooked I have actually beaten this game over a month or so later but still have tons of missions left to complete as many of the new video games are it s set up on percentages instead of LEVELS and though there are I guess we can talk old school there are different WORLDS you visit but so many missions that slowly raise the percentage so I guess you could find the certain missions to defeat just to hurry up and beat the game but the missions makes it more satisfying this games can make me so mad I see red trying to beat certain missions but other missions are a breeze but that s what I love a game that actually challenges me gives me something to work towards and when you finally beat a mission you really feel like you ve done something and the graphics are amazing I highly suggest if you liked the movie get this game or if you liked the SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS games such as Battle For Bikini Bottom The Movie and the Flying Dutchman you should get this game it s even better dare I say 
Fun and Enternaining This game is just like the film and the quality of playing is uncoutned for where the fun just keps going Highly recommended ages 3+ Don t forget the memory card 
I enjoyed it more than the original Well I picked this up being a Star Wars fan I was a little worried as the first game didn t really rock my boat but I really want to like the Star Wars rpgs so I gave this one a shot I finished it in a marathon time and enjoyed it It does have one major bug but there are fixes out there if you run into a show stopper The graphics are on par with the original but Ithought the story was superior and it kept me interested till the end I look forward to the next game in the series now 
This is her son IF YOU EVER PLAYED ANY KOTOR GAME U KNOW THAT ITS THE KING OF RPGs AND I KNOW THAT U ALL WANT THE 3RD GAME TO COME OUT TO BUT IT ISENT THE GAME GOT CANCELLED AND A BUNCH OF GUYS ONLINE ARE TRYIN TO RESURECT THE KOTOR SERIES BY MAKING THIS PETITION WE DONT HAVE NO WHERE NERE AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD ROUND 3600 SO HELP US OUT AND GO TO petition online AND HELP US RESURECT THIS GREAT SERIES 
Component Cable This is a great cable for your HD TV while playing you Sony Playstation 2 It give very crisp and clear images much better than the cable that comes with the playstation 
Definate improvement over the standard composite cable This component cable offers a clearer crisper picture on my LG LCD HDTV than the composite cable However it does have a downside The clearer picture exposes the edges of the polygons that make up the figures in games which you don t see on the composite cable It makes them appear a little rough but overall it is a better picture 
not bad using a 21inch sony crt tv wega definitely improves clarity of fonts text colors are brighter as well as vivid and some graphical elements are crisper newer generation games tekken 5 benefit from this and have immediately noticeable improvements but for older games the improvements are not as noticeable but the graphics do seem crisper and cleaner as compared to before 
Finally enjoying my HDTV to its full extent When I first got my HDTV I tried my PS2 on it and although the widescreen feature was nice the picture was grainy I was disappointed but I knew I must have missed something That something is these cables If you want your games to look good on your HDTV you NEED these cables Such a difference I can t believe I got such an improvement for this price Seriously if you spent the money on the tv spend on the money on the cables cause you re only as strong as your weakest link 
Don t bother with any other brand Don t waste your money on Monster Cable or better componenet cables This one has a razor sharp image and no rf interference And the best thing about going with the sony brand is that the PS2 side plug fits perfectly unlike others which their own mold and jiggles Makes my 56 Pioneer Elite TV look like a computer monitor go to hdtvarcade website for a complete listing of PS2 games video resolutions and sound 
Not as good as the PC game but still AWESOME Half Life 2 for the Xbox is here and somehow Valve managed to squeeze in every little ounce of gameplay that appeared in last year s hit PC game barely And let s get this out of the way now Half Life 2 for the Xbox is in terms of content exactly the same as the PC version s single player game so if you played it on the PC there s nothing new for you here And note that we did say single player game because the Xbox version lacks Counter Strike Source the latest version of the hugely popular online action game that came with Half Life 2 on the PC So when you get down to it Half Life 2 for the Xbox is basically just the acclaimed single player campaign for Half Life 2 And that s why Half Life 2 for the Xbox comes off as a bit underwhelming Yes it s a fairly solid translation of one of the better first person shooters of recent years but it also lacks the extensive multiplayer and mod making features of its PC cousin In Half Life 2 you once again assume the role of Gordon Freeman the theoretical physicist and dimension hopping commando who saved the world from an alien invasion at the end of Half Life Or did he Half Life 2 starts you off facing the infamous G Man the mysterious blue suited character from the original At the end of Half Life the G Man offered you a choice work for him or die Since there would be no sequel if you chose the latter Half Life 2 assumes you chose the former and so you start the game on a train entering City 17 for your introduction into this new world City 17 is a run down urban center that s the equivalent of the Warsaw ghettos during World War II instead of Jews being rounded up to live in City 17 it s all the remnants of a defeated humanity Half Life 2 takes place an untold number of years after the Black Mesa incident but it s clear that much has changed A mysterious enemy known as the Combine has conquered the planet and installed a human puppet government to carry out its rule Black clad security forces patrol the streets while propaganda blares endlessly from omnipresent video screens If there s one thing that Valve does extremely well it s capturing a sense of atmosphere as this vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective But you won t spend a lot of time soaking in the scene before you re thrust into the struggle to defeat the Combine and free humanity You ll be on your own during most of the game but there are levels in which you ll have the opportunity to fight alongside allies both alien and human Some of the best team moments come later when you re battling the Combine in the streets and buildings of City 17 with large scale battles going on between groups of humans and the Combine s huge spiderlike striders You never really develop any attachment to your teammates though as they tend to be very disposable and replacements are available at regular intervals Teammates have a tendency to get in your way in cramped interiors Even though they ll slowly move out of your way it s still a little annoying In addition to taking on teammates you ll occasionally have the opportunity to set up sentry guns to assist you in defense The toughest sequence that we encountered involved setting up a handful of sentry guns in a defensive alignment and then holding out against waves of incoming Combine soldiers Another surprise is the somewhat disappointing performance by the artificial intelligence Most of the humanoid enemies don t seem to show the same kind of intelligent behavior that they did in the original even on the tougher difficulty levels They ll seek cover and then peek out to fire but invariably they ll charge at you which makes it easy to take them down And maybe it s due to some of the weapons being a bit overpowered but most opponents don t present much of a challenge at all a few rounds is usually enough to stop them There are a few fearsome foes like the larger ant lions which will tirelessly pursue you while you frantically unload every bullet you have at them Then there s the strider the 50 foot tall walking organic tank that fires devastating bursts and can spear you with one of its legs if you get too close But for the most part Half Life 2 is surprisingly easy even on the tougher difficulty levels Case in point is the end of the game which feels anticlimactic You re given a horrendously overpowered weapon to use against relatively weak opposition When you get down to it Half Life 2 for the Xbox is an excellent single player game If you didn t get a chance to play the PC version then you owe it to yourself to check out the game on the Xbox even though it s not as smooth and as sharp as what you ll find on the PC You ll find few games that can match Half Life 2 s quality in terms of immersion and gameplay And all these months after its original release it s still an excellent first person shooter that should be experienced by most every action fan Just don t expect anything more after the game ends 
Very good with a few scratches Half life 2 on XBOX is is better than other shooters like Halo and the like because instead of simply going in for the kill you have to be resourceful and quick witted to navigate the levels and overcome obstacles Not to mention and I loosely quote one of Halo s developers Halo is all about the same thirty seconds of fun repeated over and over He couldn t be more correct In Half Life 2 progression usually guarantees new sights and stimulates interest in playing further The guns are not anything incredibly original but they are well balanced and have some cool features At least none of them need ten seconds to charge to make one shot effective like Covenant weapons As for story the beginning is absolutely riveting as you work to escape the Orwellian cruelty of the Combine s city The city itself is beautifully rendered and very believable as are the NPC s The alien creatures you encounter are a heck of a lot less annoying than Halo s Flood I think the head crabs could use work though They look like animate rotisserie chickens Awesome game by far better than most of the competition My only major complaint is that the vehicle levels are too long and repetitive and the vehicle controls suck and you can t see a freakin thing This won t kill the game for you but by God in the ski boat level it will definitely try Anyway if you like shooters at all buy this one 
The Best FPS on Xbox I have played every FPS that comes out on Xbox Of course I like Halo Doom 3 but love playing anything Conflict makes i e Desert Storm I and II Vietnam and Global Terror and the Rainbow 6 series since I m in the Army Half Life 2 is by far the best game I have played I thought I wouldn t like it because it had no map option or hints for objectives but all you have to do is have time and an imagination and you will be spending hours on end playing this game I bought it for 15 00 at Game Stop but if I had of spent 49 99 I would not have been disappointed one bit I have not beat this game but have put over 512 over 8 hours minutes into it This is definitely worth buying used or new if you have time you will get your worth out of this game C Murde 
WTF STOP LOADING Half Life 2 for pc put on the x box sounds like it should work The core gameplay is still the same and is good fun once you get a few hours into it The graphics are decent but won t blow you away like the pc versian So what s the problem it s Half life 2 on the x box just a little watered down Well there is one single problem that really irritates me to the point i would give it three stars L O A D I N G This game loads more than you actually play it It simply ruins the action Your in the middle of a tense adrenaline pumped chase and your really into it when it all suddenly stops and the game loads The loading times last between seven to thirty seconds and it really just makes you want to swear at the t v screen Half life 2 for x box isn t bad game but it is completley inferior to the p c problem which had loading problems as well It s possibly worth a rental if can sit through all the constant loading but beyond the loading issue it s worth a playthrough There is no multiplayer and the single player is all your getting so don t buy 
The best game on Xbox In my opinion yes Anyone who has heard about this game but doesn t have a fast enough computer to run it as was the case with me should buy this game The gameplay is inspired There is only one section midway through the game where I felt that the transition from mouse and keyboard to a console control pad hurt the game Outside of that one complaint the graphics are amazing for Xbox the sound design is girpping with atmospheric music that wafts in and out The characters are interesting and well acted Everything about this game is TOP NOTCH Anyone who says that Halo 2 is a better game is quite simply an idiot Halo obviously has better multiplayer as this game has none but outside of that there is simply nothing on Xbox that comes close to the single player experience Awesome awesome game 
Even better than a new Zelda game Story Gameplay In playing as Amaterasu A Sun God awoken to defend a classical Japanese village in the area of Nippon you will use a variety of weapons combat techniques and Celestial brushes to defeat your enemies and rid the land of an ancient evil that has been resurrected The weapons will be your standard platforming arsenal of short and long ranged devices that you use to keep yourself from harm and try for the opposite effect with your enemies These will include various twists on Japanese Imperial Regalia to include A reflector disk Your beginning weapon Rosary Beads Your primary ranged weapon and a Glaive Powerful long sword The Celestial Brush is what makes this game unique It allows you to pause the game at any time using the R1 button and paint various symbols to have a wide reaching effect on gameplay These include but are not limited to attacking enemies objects bringing back life to various dead flora creating platforms and in general showing off your God like ability to affect almost every aspect of reality in the game The Celestial Brush will be your major gameplay factor in practically every puzzle the game offers It s also used for story progression and helping out some of your village friends think they can do things they really can t without them knowing Art Graphics Okami draws a lot of it s animations from Japanese watercolor paintings most famous from the Ukiyo e style Like the game Zelda The Windwaker which people most commonly relate Okami to Cel shading is used as opposed to 3D Polygon textures to give the game a more animated feel This serves the purpose of bringing out smoother movements in the character models and bringing the characters themselves more to life Unlike the aforementioned game however Okami uses a brushed style that helps bring more color into the game rather than focusing solely on shape definition In short it s the best thing that Cel shading has ever produced It even winds up showing off a lot better than some of the cinematic driven games to date Music Voice Acting The music in this game is on par with many of its platforming brethren and exceeds a lot of the standards for the genre The scores are large numbered and always seem to have a good piece of music to back up whatever situation you as a Brush wielding Sun God defending good in the form of a wolf may find yourself in The voice acting is the only thing that could bring this game down The simple truth There is none Well it s no great loss because the game does fine without it However during the opening sequence which consequentially is about 14 minutes too long the little humming sounds that they use instead will probably have you wanting to claw your ears out before it s done After this little sequence however you should be good to go through the rest of the game Controls I list Controls as its own category because quite simply they will make or break a game I won t lie to you I was a little skeptical when I heard that somebody had a made Zelda clone for the PS2 based in feudal Japan But from the moment I picked up the controller and started maneuvering smoothly through the cel shaded environment switching from weapons to brushes quicker than thought I was sold Okami has some of the most intuitive controls of any Console game I ve ever played You will almost never have one of those moments where you are left thinking If only I had put the camera somewhere else Overall Okami is a fun Action Adventure Platforming game that will keep you locked in to the very end The Brushed Cel shading quite frankly outdoes itself as you progress through rich and peaceful villages as well as dark and brooding cursed lands The controls boast more than their fair share versatility as they put in your hands the ability to change the very fabric of existence surrounding your character with just the few buttons and strokes of your brush The downsides you will see in the game mostly center on the distinct lack of Voice acting and the horrendously long opening sequence These however do very little to detract from the overall masterpiece that Clover Studios has created Okami takes everything that made people love the N64 and Gamecube Zelda games and then improves upon them ten fold Yes I though it was impossible too to create one of the most original and masterwork Action Adventure games to ever hit the markets and has no competition whatsoever on the Playstation 2 gaming console 
Got a vacation coming Good You re going to be obsessed with this game This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful positive entrancing funny inventive has a great soundtrack and doesn t involve violence carnage I m 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks My 6 year old son was equally engaged and was able to complete about 40 of it without help himself he needed help with boss battles or anything under time pressure You can lose hours to this game but you won t emerge with tense sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks At the same time it is definately not too easy It s just challenging enough And it s long thank goodness because I didn t want it to end The overall tone is so positive You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world You have weapons and you do take out monsters but your weapon is a ink brush and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes Simply brilliant and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover 
Nancy Drew s First Adventure Although this doesn t follow the original book it s a combination of several stories it holds the 1930 s flavor The design of the scenes are appealing and there are enough puzzles throughout the story I don t know if this is with all the DVDs but with this one I had to keep the mouse pointer a half inch or so in front of the car in order to move it which sometimes proved a bit annoying In playing it twice now I ve discovered that you can solve the clues in a different order and still come to the same conclusion Nice 
I was not disappointed As always the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint Personally I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going and to tour the rest of the town I must admit I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn t have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose but hey it s nice to see they have a penchant for detail After all what town doesn t have a Courthouse heh Indeed this game could have been designed to be twice as enduring and there were several ways this could have been accomplished but to be honest enduring does not equate with endearing Every ND game has satisfied me on many levels even if a few levels were left wanting I also enjoyed going back in time to 1930 albeit there were a few inconsistencies regarding what took place when i e the turntable revolving the wrong way et al however a good detective will notice these faux pas Like I say there s rarely any disappointment when it comes to the Nancy Drew games One can only hope they continue to create these games indefintely My only gripe is that they come out with only two games a year My wish would be for four or five 
Sadly disappointing I was so disappointed in the new addition to the Nancy Drew games I solved the whole case in two evenings and never once had to check with the online community to see if I was doing it right The puzzles were not near as challenging as the other games and I was disappointed that the body of the games involves having to drive around and deliver telegrams I have come to love these games because of the challenging aspects and the mind bending puzzles This one did NOT make my list of favorites 
Great fun for D D and any RPG fans A thoroughly enjoyable game If you like games like Neverwinter Nights or Diablo then this game is for you Lots of fun A wide selection of races and classes to choose from I recommend this game to anyone who has a fondness for RPG style video games 
One of the Best Game from BlackIsle There are 2 games in this Ultimate Collection IWD + Expansion Pack and the other is IWD2 And there s a BGM CD in it and of course manuals included This Ultimate Collection is better than I thought because I purchased Baldur s Gate Ultimate Collection too But only Game CDs in it no manuals 
IWD1 does in fact run in XP I m playing a game of it now The reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because I am currently running a game of IWD1 with Windows XP as I make this post 
Icewind Dale RPG This game is great for those that enjoy role playing games There is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story It was a lot of fu 
If You Like the Show You ll LOVE the Game Ignore anyone who talks about this game s shortcomings It s a fun game addictive game Period Although one reviewer suggests that some of the levels are too easy I say that this only goes to keep the game and the plot moving In fact let s face it when you break the tasks down events in a typical episode of 24 aren t that complex You run you hide you shoot things You drive fast and chase people But you do it all looking sounding and panting yes the video Jack Bauer even breathes like him almost as if you were in the show The KISS adage is fabulously apt Keeping it simple is how the game makers have kept it fun Related to this is the comment about trying to make the actual game play last 24 hours Firstly the show itself is a little loosy goosey about real hour what with commercial breaks and its creative liberties Secondly each hour is broken up into smaller missions and learning what it takes to do well in each section can take little time Thirdly those that choose to complete their missions with finesse and higher scores will find that they re not only coming closer the hour they re also having more fun because they re acting more like the characters in the show After all I suppose that someone who wants to complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone and instead just run past the enemies Or better yet if that reviewer really wants to take the 24 hour thing seriously I m surprised that he isn t complaining about being able to save progress to a memory card He really ought to be asking for a game that s played straight out for an entire 24 hours no saving get it right the first time just like on the show 
Awesome This game is awesome I bought and it reminds me of the show exactly The graphics are the best I ve ever seen I feel like I m right there next to Jack and Tony fighting in a race against time The game is challenging but not to challenging you can t beat it It has a lot of action packed levels with a lot of options You ll really want to get this game It s definatley worth it 
Yet Another Day in the Life of Jack Bauer Like 90 of the people who played this game my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24 The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show it should not have been too hard to please me with this game And in that respect the game fulfilled but did not exceed my expectations While I enjoyed watching this extra day the gameplay left a lot to be desired There was quite a bit of variety which was nice and you get to play as almost every character from the show There were so many different types of missions that the standard get from point A to point B while shooting people missions only made up about 60 of the game The rest of the game involved driving computer hacking interrogating sniping and such This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked since the controls were incredibly sloppy Interrogation was kind of fun the first time but it didn t need to be done several times There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again so that they weren t much fun by the end of the game As for the rest of the game I d describe it as mediocre There wasn t anything spectacular about the gameplay there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter In addition there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult in my opinion In one such mission you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working It wouldn t be nearly so annoying if it weren t for the fact that there doesn t seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly they never hit a single enemy so you have to take everyone out yourself In all the game is worth playing through for the story if you re a fan of the show Otherwise you could find much better action games out there

You will never pick up NBA Live again I have always loved EA games i have purchased every single Madden game since 97 and every nba live game since 01 With that said I see very little improvement over the years Last year NFL 2K5 blew away Madden so i figured I would give Sega another chance After playin NBA 2K6 I have trully become addicted It s really sad because i skip work to play this wonderful game However with the many pros of NBA 2k6 thier are also a few cons Pros wonderful graphics Superb gameplay realistic from the very start Cons Learn to use directional passing or be a ball hog because you will have a lot of tunovers otherwise The soundtrack is horrible but you can just put the tv on mute until you start playing a game Dunks are also not as flashy as nba live but you won t care much The bottom line GO GET THIS GAME NOW STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND PURCHASE THIS GAME PRONTO IF YOU HAVE IT GET ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW BREAKS THROW NBA LIVE IN THE TRASH OR TRADE IT IN FOR THIS GAME END OF STROY 
I dunno guys After playing the big three b ball games for 06 NBA Live NBA 2K6 and NBA 06 The Life and reading the reviews posted here for each I m still not convinced about much of anything other than the makers of these games got a bunch of our hard earned dollars for giving us very little as far as quality gaming To wit 1 NBA Live 06 This series should be fantastic but seems to keep taking major steps backwards with every new release Horrible graphics annoying bugs crash crash crash inferior gameplay and nothing new under the sun Heck instead of extra s like 2K6 s street ball all we ve got included here is the lame retro Live version from what ten years ago C mon Is anybody even going to play this Compare EA s NBA franchise with their innovative and exciting Madden series Not even close I know pro football brings in the big bucks and the NBA is barely a close second but maybe EA needs to switch their development teams around for next years installments 2 NBA 06 The Life Ugh Nice idea absolutely horrible awful crappy execution Everything other than the premise is garbage Speaking of instead of buying this stinker I should ve just tossed my money in the garbage I can t even trade it in none of the secondhand dealers around PDX want to take it 3 NBA 2K6 Now here I had hope The game includes pretty much all the nifty stuff I want out of a basketball sim but the overall package is still somewhat lacking The interface is NOT very user friendly and the overall graphics look like they were lifted from five year old product I can create a player but how do I get that player onto a roster No clue The menu doesn t give me a hint I ve pressed every button I can think of with no results and the instruction book is no help here And why once I create a player from the roster portion of the main menu can t I use that player in the 24 7 section of the game Why do I have to spend more time doing it all over again And sorry guys but the player graphics in the game are just okay the players in the cutaways look like they re made out of rubber and the detail in the actual games is lousy the courts in NBA Live are much more realistic although the fans here perform like well fans especially during the cut sequences after a ref s whistle and a stop in play they celebrate with high five s boo bad calls etc The courts and menu graphics however look like something from well a game from five or six years ago And the actual basketball even though the play is a bit more realistic than NBA Live s it s still only adequate and using the right joystick for shot control is worse than making a guess HOWEVER At twenty bucks it s the cheapest of the bunch so I didn t feel like I was investing in a fake diamond mine in Africa There s so many nifty options to keep this game fresh with the deep sim franchise mode and the 24 7 streetball mode the average gamer should be happy just playing ball and the rest of us who ve played our fair share of b ball can keep some interest after dunking our way through a couple seasons I like that there are stats like crazy that there s total control and in depth franchise simulation right down to the last details like creating your franchise s GM building a custom franchise or designing your players shoes and that the computer controlled players actually DO something in games and play like their real life counterparts the big men claim rebounds I love that I can tie up the opposing teams ball handler and the ref s actually call jump balls Although I can win a tip but not claim the ball after The commentary may be the best ever in a b ball sim do whatever you need to keep Kenny Smith on board this project and is rarely repetitive I like the replay and player cutaways during the game and crazy enough I ve been missing having an actual halftime show in NBA Live instead of just getting a menu with stats remember when EA used real dancer photo s during halftime Liked that a lot but guess I ll take the silly animated cheerleaders here instead All in all I d say this is a toss up between the two big boys Since I ve played the NBA Live franchise for so long I d hope to see EA take a lesson from 2K6 and make the jump to this level of gaming simulation and then a step or two further Or on the flip side for 2K6 to incorporate the stuff EA does right and improve on it THEN maybe we ll finally have a basketball simulation worth the twenty or thirty or fifty bucks we fans keep shelling out year after year 
Fun game bad graphics The basketball aspect of this game is a little more fun than NBA Live 2006 just because the refs do not constantly interupt gmaeplay But graphic wise this game has the worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 I m talking about the PS2 version But the close up graphics are very good My faveorite part of the game is that you can even do a fantasy draft on play now mode But if you are a basketball fan you really should get this it is extremely fun 
You want a worthy adversary I ll GIVE you a worthy adversary Kyle Katarn was once a Jedi Knight He once helped the fledgling New Republic in its strugle against the Empire Until Drommund Kaas when he confronted the darkness in himself and gave in to it So he gave up his lightsaber to Luke Skywalker swearing never to touch the Force again He went back to working as a New Republic mercenary alongside Jan Ors the only other person in the galaxy who knew the location of the fabled Valley of the Jedi and the incalculable power it contained He might have lived the rest of his life that way with only his blaster his wits and Jan the woman he loved to count on Until they took one mission that ended all that They met Desann a powerful Dark Jedi and his apprentice Tavion They along with Admiral Galak Fyyar an Imperial scientist are trying to find a way to artificially infuse the Force into living subjects to mass produce their own army of Dark Jedi Needless to say they succeed and it s all Kyle s fault So what s a former Jedi to do Simple Take back your Force abilities reclaim your lightsaber and go hunting This game did a great job of improving on the combat and Force powers of the original JEDI KNIGHT Your Force abilities are taken directly from the movies with none of the showy powers you saw in the original You end up with eight in all four neutral two light and two dark but they re selected for you automatically You can t upgrade them as freely as you could before The lightsaber combat is vastly improved they used motion capture to animate Kyle and his enemies and it shows Even the lightsabers themselves look better like they were taken directly from the movies The enemies are just what you d want in a STAR WARS game They basically fall into three categories Imperials bounty hunters and the Reborn The Imperials range from stormtroopers killing them NEVER gets old officers droids and engineers The bounty hunters are from four different races Rodians Grans Trandoshans and Weequay and they re pretty much interchangable But the Reborn oh boy are THEY a challenge The Reborn are the result of Admiral Fyyar s experiements in artificially stimulating midichlorian production They re all Dark Jedi and they re all insane from the process You ll want to pay attention to what color they re wearing when you fight them orange and blue aren t so bad green is tougher but red and black Be ready for a FIGHT And that s not even counting the Shadowtroopers The boss enemies are nicely varied as well Reelo Baruk the criminal connection is nothing Admiral Fyyar with his shielded power armor is like a walking tank Tavion and Desann are VERY crafty those two are the toughest enemies in the game Fortunately you won t be completely alone Jan Ors fights alongside you briefly as do Republic soldiers and fellow Jedi Knights Raven Software even had the brilliant idea of bringing in Lando Calrissian voiced by Billy Dee Williams HIMSELF and Luke Skywalker to back you up In fact fighting alongside Luke is one of the game s high points the two of you are squaring off against both stormtroopers and Reborn in one area My only complaint is that it was over WAY too soon The locales are just as eclectic as you d expect from a STAR WARS game or movie for that matter You go from an abandoned Imperial listening post to a crystal mine under Imperial control to Nar Shaddaa Bespin an asteroid base an Imperial Star Destroyer even Yavin 4 home of the Jedi Academy itself And every location find new ways to challenge you no matter what powers or weapons you have at the time But once again it s the story that pulls you in more than anything else The continuing story of what happens to the New Republic after the movies is compelling enough I think we all wonder what happened after RETURN OF THE JEDI but framing it around the events of Kyle Katarn s life puts YOU right there in the middle of it all Kyle s a fascinating character make no mistake kind of like a hybrid of Luke and Han Solo but YOU RE the one directing the action YOU RE slugging it out with stormtroopers YOU RE slinging a lightsaber against Dark Jedi YOU RE a Jedi Knight And that s the best selling point I can think of 
Let s travel back in time to when Lucasarts was a good company Today Lucasarts is nothing but a greedy company that cares nothing about its customers and I can t same I m impressed with George Lucas these days either But anyway when Jedi Outcast hit stores Lucasarts was the best gaming company in existance They had a NICE CEO unlike the one they have now One who actually CARED about us gamers I m sorry I m really ranting here In Jedi Outcast the 2nd best game in history second only to KOTOR you play an ex Jedi named Kyle Katarn The story takes place about 10 years or so after Return of the Jedi and Kyle Katarn you have given up your lightsaber and Force powers in fear of falling to the Dark Side But the Republic needs you so you must train to become a Jedi again and face your destiny There are many interesting and cool characters in the game like the fat Rodian garbage collector Reelo Baruk and your companion Jan Ors Not to mention the master of the Sith Desann and his apprentice Tavion Also the multiplayer mode is FANTASTIC The only problem is no one is ever playing I play by myself with AI bots and its still really fun You can be stormtroopers with lightsabers The single player is amazing too The storyline is somewhat confusing but interesting all the same The graphics are pretty impressive for a 2002 game and the combat system is nicely done I love slashing the arms of of stormtroopers What fun Yes its true you only use a blue single bladed lightsaber in the game BUT NEVER FEAR I have discovered a cheat to change your blade color First hold SHIFT and hit located to the left of the 1 key This will bring up the console Type devmapall no quotes and hit enter Next type sabercolor x where X is what color your saber can be Here are the colors orange yellow red blue green and purple Enjoy that one While cheating always do devmapall first It enables the cheats My all time favorite cheat is g_saberrealisticcombat 3 I won t tell you what it does Find out for yourself by killing an enemy But its funny Don t worry it doesn t crash the game I wouldn t do that to you I first discovered the wonders of Outcast when I played it at my cousins house We sat there for hours having fun and screwing with the cheats And that s also really cool cheating does not mess up the game in any way shape or form unlike many other games In other games you cheat it has a price Usually an expensive one In Outcast you cheat its FREE There is one problem I have with this game and that is the glitches There aren t many that affect gameplay but sometimes the walls are flashing and it gets sorta annoying My cousin who has beaten the game at least 10 times has discovered many glitches including a room where Tavion is standing and you can walk through her a room filled with lights contained three floating AT STs and even a room with mountains painted on the ceiling I actually found the last one But its kind of fun discovering these weird rooms There are quite a lot of them Wow just writing this makes me want to play the game I m gonna go play it I remember when Outcast was 49 99 Now the price has gone down 40 00 NOWS YOUR CHANCE BUY THIS GAME 
Great game The only problem I had with this game I use a steering wheel and it keeps locking up but with the game pad it doesn t This is a very fun and hard game to play I m not done with it yet but I love the cars and the graphics and the races This is really a great game There are parts of the game where you can race for money or for fun and all the races are fun to play When I need to race I normally pick this game most of the time 
Patience required The only faults I can find in this otherwise great game are the horribly long load times and how long it takes to get a decent car to race with The game is very addictive especially when it comes to tuning your hard won new car Customization of your car is extremely detailed and is almost as fun as racing The computer cars give you a real challenge in certain types of races but you can change the difficulty level if you find it to be a little too hard at first The scenery is gorgeous Being able to drive anywhere you want is really fun too I actually prefer this game over EA s newer release Most Wanted I would recommend this game but patience is needed for your first few hours of gameplay 
Great fun if you like driving from shop to shop and from race to race Pros Almost unlimited customization for your car s in depth tuning can be great fun to play sometimes when you are actually racing some of the in game effects like weather are done well graphics are good but not nearly as good as GT4 Cons unrealistic but I suppose that s not the point of this game can t some combine the realistic driving engine from Gran Turismo and the customization from a game like this the possiblities would be amazing you have to drive EVERYWHERE I want to f ing race not spend five minutes driving from the performance shop to the graphics shop before driving another five minutes to the actual race to progress in the game you need to raise your car s rating and the only way to get the really high ratings is to put gawding looking crap on your car like spinners massive hood scoops and huge wings that make your car look like its being attacked by a UFO please some of us actually have taste and like our cars to look tastefully done Overall an OK arcadish game that anyone who likes to drive around not racing and putting terribly ugly crap on your cars will probably have a lot of fun with but I think I ll stick with the Gran Turismo series 
Need for Speed This game is a blast I am a female addicted to cars Being a girl we like to modify things like in sims such as paint and pick and choose so it is great for girls in this aspect But to be able to modify a car it is great in general Most of us dont have money to put all these mods on our vehicles so its great to just play around with the ideas As far as racing I had a blast I however did find it difficult to maneuver the cars in certain situations but eventually you get the hang of it This is a high addictive game I would recommend to any car lover 
Great Transaction Good prices fast shipping and good packaging Can t get much better Thank you 
Saves you 50 The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is very easy to set up and use All you have to do is plug the little receiver into one of the controller ports put in a DVD and enjoy The buttons on the remote are responsive and easy to get used to However the Xbox DVD system is very simple It doesn t have any eject buttons something mentioned many times by other reviewers and not as many options as more expensive stand alone DVD players You have to keep in mind that it was made for people who already have an Xbox and don t want to shell out an extra 50 for a DVD player that has a lot of special features when all they want is to be able to watch a movie The DVD itself runs exactly as it would on a good stand alone DVD player It s sort of like one of those little 100 digital cameras There isn t anything really special about them They just take good pictures that you can put on your computer 
Xbox DVD Kit I know that many of you probably had DVD players before you picked up an Xbox That s simply the case with early adopters However that doesn t mean you should automatically skip the Xbox remote Firstly you need a remote control kit for playback You cannot simply stick in a DVD and start monkeying around with a controller Sorry There are several remotes to choose from but the official model is comfortable and well laid out If you ve ever used an RCA remote than you can guess how it feels and how it s organized I would guess that for many readers their Xbox is a secondary DVD player Small easy to use and relatively affordable the remote adds much value to your big black bo 
Do NOT buy Substitutes Buy the original Buy the original Microsoft XBOX DVD Remote I bought a substitute from Game Liquidation and after only 10 movies the receiver transmitter stopped working I did not get a refund although I returned the product The original remote is GREAT No problems so far and I have seen dozens of movies satisfaction guaranteed 
An excellent Star Wars game Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series INTRODUCTION I ve pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars and as you may have guessed I m a fan of many of the games based on the series Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss when one succeeds it usually succeeds beautifully One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces released for the Playstation One and the PC Although the game itself was horrendous with a terribly choppy framerate and very poor level design it was something the world had never seen before a Star Wars first person shooter The sequel Jedi Knight cleaned up a lot of the problems and added in some new innovations And now the third game in the series Jedi Outcast has arrived Like previous games in this sub series it has gotten a multi console release Read on to see how it fares OVERVIEW Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first person shooter The game has a one player quest as well as several different multiplayer modes REVIEW To put it simply this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been While not perfect this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn the agent from the other Dark Forces titles The second Death Star has been destroyed but many Imperial forces still fight on so it s up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them The graphics are for the most part solid I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game Nothing state of the art but they re still pretty damn good Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber The single player mode is extremely entertaining and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package And you can save whenever you want to in the single player mode But of course the game isn t perfect Like earlier Dark Forces games the level design just is not that good Too many areas look alike and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into Likewise in many cases your objectives are unclear and some of the puzzles are a pain I don t know about you but I buy first person shooters to shoot people not solve puzzles Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design it took me over an hour just to beat the first level Another huge problem is availability Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game This is a huge problem since the game s limited control selections will often clash with what you re used to for this sort of game This game wasn t released on the consoles in very high quanitites so you re likely gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy and in my mind it s NOT worth that price Sad but true I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans just be warned that it s not perfect and it s hard to get a copy EDITION NOTES This is a good game but for some strange reason it just wasn t available on the consoles for very long Because of this even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game Still you should hunt it down if you re into this sort of thing OVERALL Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub series thusfar Where the game succeeds it succeeds beautifully I am impressed with the game it s just a shame the consular version was not made readily available to all would be players I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan 
FUN BUT EXTREMELY HARD FIRST OF ALL I AM A BIG STAR WARS FAN AND THIS GAME ROCKS BUT YOU MUST BE REALLY CLEVER AOMETIMES THE LEVELS ARE SO HARD I HAD TO YOUS CHEATS TO UNLOCK THE OTHER LEVELS BUT THEN I BEAT THE OTHERS P S CAN SOMEONE HELP ME I M ON YAVIN FINAL CONFLICT AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE THREE PLACES TO GO I8 HAVE KNOW IDEA WHTA TO DO BECAUSE IPUT OUT THE FIRE AND THEN PUSHED THE WALLS BACK AND NOW DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO PLEASE HELP ME 
EXCELLENT GAME Hi I love Nancy Drew and I think this is Herinteractive s best game since Danger on Deception Island I highly not to mention strongly recommend this game In this game you get to snorkle for shells to make hawaiin neclaces fish for ulua hawaiin shore fish and more Most people think The creature of Kapu cave is the worst Nancy Drew Don t believe them People who complain that it s a short game actually print a walkthrough zip through the game and then start complaining Herinteractive has even created new features 1 You can switch from Joe Hardy to Frank Hardy and to Nancy Drew by calling each character on their cellphone 2 You can change the design of the control panel on the bottom of the screen 3 Go snorkeling for shells to make beautiful necklaces to trade for Big Island Bucks 4 Program your GPS Global Postitioning System to navigate from rainforests to even Kapu cave 5 Explore the Hilihili research facility 6 Look through the boss of Hilihili s stuff while he is in the same room snoozin I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME 
Lots of New Features In The Creature of Kapu Cave Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys work together to solve a mystery surrounding the dying pineapple crops in Hawaii the possible relation between this and the top secret scientific work being done nearby the family who owns a vacation excursion center Nancy is there working with an entomologist bug scientist the Hardy Boys are in Hawaii to do some detective work on the family who runs the excursion center The locals believe that a mytholocial creature has been angered is therefore responsible for the dying crops are they right If not who else could be behind it why This ND game has several new features First you go back forth playing both Nancy Drew the Hardy Boys with each being responsible for different parts of the story Also through the use of a GPS you drive wherever you need to go Although I thought the graphics were great I didn t like the fact that I couldn t stay in any one area for very long once you do 1 or 2 things you have to move on to another place or do an identity switch between Nancy the Hardy s Because of this there wasn t too much to explore in any one place Overall I really liked playing The Creature of Kapu Cave but I would have enjoyed it more had I been able to explore each area more wasn t forced to move from place to place so quickly 
Great game if anyone has played any of the final fantasy games then im sure they would love it It dosent have the greatest graphics but it is sure worth playing The only thing that made me want to pull out my hair was how long the begining was 
The best RPG for the PSP so far Valkyrie Profile was an RPG that came out during the later days of the PSX While it never achieved massive success it went on to become an RPG classic and has garnered a very loyal following Fast forward to 2006 and we see the re release of this awesome RPG for the PSP However don t make the mistake of writing this off as a plain old port Valkyrie Profile Lenneth includes new high quality CG movies that help immerse you in the story The graphics consist of highly detailed sprites on pre rendered backgrounds when seen on the vivid PSP screen it just makes the game look downright beautiful Some of the combos are just awesome to look at The battle system is a mix of real time and turn based fighting that is surprisingly intuitive newcomers and old pro s will have no problem getting used to it At first glance it might look simple but as you progress through the game you ll find a depth to it that makes it quite fun The main story itself is very well developed even if this RPG doesn t follow the traditional linear way of telling it One of the things I enjoyed most about this game is the character episodes you see when you collect a new soul to help in the battle to save Valhalla If you enjoy RPGs or feel adventurous enough I highly recommend you buy this game It s definitely a must have PSP game 
A moving story Graphics 7 10 Well we are talking about a PS1 port So don t expect much here But the new CGs are nice and even the old PS1 sprites are actually pretty nicely animated And the super special moves PWS are rather nice too Sound 6 10 The dialoguing is very annoying at first It s very much apparent the moment you start up the game when you have to go through the prologue Once you get used to it it s not bad The sound effects seem a bit primitive too but again this is a rather old game Btw as the fans will quickly note the game uses the same voice actors as Pokemon D Gameplay 7 10 It s an interesting mix of platforming puzzles turn based and real time combat Personally I did not enjoy the platforming part That genera was never my favorite and the PSP s diagonal insensitivity makes some of the jumps a pain to do The combat is rather fun and original But after about mid game your characters are so over leveled and over equipped almost all of the battles except for a few boss battles become trivial Replay 8 10 There s a lot to do here And the chances are that on your first game you ve missed out the A ending the true ending The standard B ending is pretty mundane And there are quite a few characters in the game and you probably will not get to explore all of them until you replay the game Personally I m a story driven player so once I know the plot I have little interest in replaying the game but I think many players don t mind going through the story again and for such players the replay value should be fairly high Story 9 10 A most excellent story The many characters that you come across have rather poignant stories and you learn that each of them are small reflections of your main character The plot is weaved very nicely although it is somewhat slow in the beginning My only negative that s keeping this from being a 10 10 is the very last scene it somewhat left me unfulfilled But I hear that s a matter of opinion 
Great remake but where s the fast forward My kingdom for a fast forward button Great remake but where s the fast forward My kingdom for a fast forward button This was a great game The cut scenes were a nice touch that helped draw in the player into the story line but would someone please give me a Fast Forward Skip button I understand that the makers of the game want you to get involved and appreciate the storyline but without a fastforward skip button this game game has a limited replay value I have already played through the game once and now that I am running through it again I am going insane The long cut scenes and the seemingly endless next clicks were fine the first time but come on For a game that has 3 different endings you would figure that the developers would give you a break OK now that I have said that lets get back to the review The character development and use of magical items while definitely not unique but they helped flesh out the fight scenes The combos and skills moves made the game interesting and kept me coming back While I would have liked to see the graphics slightly change when different equipment was used swords helms etc the combat and special moves graphics were definitely nice Should you buy Sure if you like RPG s the game is definitely a buy but be fore warned be prepared to read and read and read and click and click and click before you even get to your first fight scene and even then expect to much of the same long before you get to do things on your own 
A good game but VERY SHORT I found 007 Agent Under Fire a good game but it was too short just 5 hours long The missions were fun and you get to drive the tricked out James Bond cars with the machine guns and the rockets and a whole lot of gadgets the watch laser and the list goes on The missions are fun especially when you are driving the Soviet T 80 and using the gaulting gun with the 80 MM gun barrell killing the bad guys The missions take you all over the world to Romania the UK embassy in Hungary and the list goes on A good game but it could of been better 
John Scott 9 year old gamer bye itThis is the best game ever made it beats night fire by a long shot night fire is a fun 2 player game but the missonssuck its the best bye it 
Decent but not Fantastic The art is quite simply the most amazing part of this game However the story is thin and the gameplay can be repetitive I beat it in less than 12 hours and I did every sidequest 
Really fun This game is really fun I don t know if it gets old yet but it is a nice way to relax and play a game My only problem with it is that when releasing it in the US they couldn t spell it s name right Katamari Damashi That isn t too hard for the average American is it There is no c in Japanese Come on Sony you are a Japanese company for crying out loud And for those who are interested Katamari a lump a cluster a mass Damashi a spirit a soul a ghos 
incredible until you get to level 4 first off let me say for the most part katamari damacy is an amazing game if you don t know the story behind it well it wasn t thought up by game designers and that s why it s so original the game ideas came from a lady who didn t even like video games and they used her ideas to make it in a world where if you ve played one RPG you ve played them all if you ve played one shooter you ve played them all etc katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air and i m glad it s popular the music is strangely catchy it has a great sense of humor the attention to detail is absolutely astounding a ton of work must have went into this game and it s surprisingly very addictive and fun in fact unless you ve actually played this game you won t understand how fun and addictive it is show me many games and i can say i d like that or i wouldn t like that but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand and there s even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend you roll around a katamari a ball of stuff and pick up more and more stuff that automatically sticks to your katamari the bigger your katamari gets the bigger stuff you can pick up if this sounds stupid to you there s a reason you haven t played it yet trust me it rocks while katamari damacy looks like a kid s game it s not there s too much strategy too much nuance here for young minds on the other hand younger kids can play chess so maybe but generally kids play stuff like halo 2 that requires little thought my complaint is level 4 i ve tried about 10 times to beat this level and from what i see i don t think i will ever be able to so for me the game stops here it has a 10 minute time limit and the closest i ve got 73 cm i need to get to 1 m i m not a gaming genius or anything but i m at least an average gamer and regularly play online against other gamers and do very well in my opinion they really dropped the ball on this level with such a strict requirement to be honest i m really surprised anybody has beaten this level with so little time how many more times should i try 5 20 100 it s disappointing maybe me and my katamari is more gaming friendly another thing is the view on the screen isn t quite big enough it s very easy to be lost with so little of a view you can t change the camera angle you can only turn around it would probably be better with a bigger camera view and a camera that changes angles automatically also the controls to turn around and charge are too difficult to turn around you press L3 and R3 at the same time why not just have us a press a button to charge you flip the analog sticks up and down really fast too much trouble for a feature that s pretty useless anyway why would you want to run when you ll just run into something anyway the game consists of a lot of moving back and forth and to the side you don t need to move forward fast so it s not a perfect game but it s very impressive nonetheless i just wish i could play the rest of it 
Weirdly addictive disappointingly short I played this game with some friends out of town and seriously had to acquire a PS2 just to satisfy my craving Not a shooter game not an rpg you just roll Seriously It s surprisingly awesome actually but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing it was done I d beat it and I m really not a big gamer And I don t know how much mileage I m really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2 player mode Maybe the sequel is better I hope 
good times Well i first played this game at my friends house and thought it was quite adddicting even though my friend had hated it When i started to play it shows you how to get started and is very simple for just about anyone who knows how to read i put this game up right beside kingdom hearts 2 for its gameplay not the graphhics it also has a great soundtrack 5 thumbs up eat your cheesemuffins everyday = 
KIDS WILL LOVE THIS GAME I got this game for my kids One is 11 and one is 9 They love it They can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it Like baseball soccer boxing etc Hey this even come with the camera I rated 4 stars because of the graffics They are not the best but still acceptible Hope this review helps 
Great fun for me and my kids I got this for my 8 year old son He had a blast moving jumping waving his hands playing the game My 4 year old daughter easily picked up the games too Bubble Pop is her favorite I love the Anti grav demo game and intend on getting the actual game later on It is amazing technology at work This is not a passive PS2 game at all and you can break a sweat while playing That s what I call fun We can even make funny videos of ourselves and see ourselves perform on TV That is cool 
great video game this video game was recommended to me by my 19 yr old son for my 7 yr old son it is a great hit my 7 yr old loves it and my other sons ages 19 and 22 enjoy it also very entertaining well worth the money 
MUCH better than the first Eye Toy Play 2 is much better than the first While the first had limits on what you could actually do this one has very few There is a much larger variety of games and different activities Such as running during a baseball game dodging searchlights while collecting items chopping pickles and smashing tomatoes defeating a three headed hydra and so much more During multiplayer mode you get to take a picture of your face which is then placed in the head of a robot monkey which is a hilarious touch Also during multi player mode when a tie occurs the players get to do a tie breaker in the form of a fun little mini game The downside to this is that if you want to play the minigames at anytime you have to force a tie which can be a pain Downsides to Eye Toy Play 2 Some of the games are more frustrating than challenging and the instrutions in the booklet aren t very clear Like most Eye Toy games you have to turn on all the lights nearby and open the curtains to get decent enough lighting Even when the camera is set to Dim Room The video messaging is terrible You don t get to choose a background like in the original Eye Toy and the image is small and distorted The Playroom is difficult to find and there is a limited ammount of games some of which make no sense Like when it asks you to put a brightly coloured image in front of the camera It s just weird Overall Eye Toy Play 2 is completely worth the buy It s hours of endless fun and the games never seem to get old 
Great Game This is a great game However I can only play it at a friend s house Even though I pre ordered it from Toys R Us in July it somehow is not getting shipped to me until November I wish I could play it at my own home 
Loved it just extremely hard at times Yeah this game is really fun just gets extremely hard at times towards the end Have a little over 10 hours into it kind of short I guess but each mission might take you a few tries to complete Plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like I did I d say it s easily one of the best games out for the DS though One that everyone should have in their DS collection 
REally exciting different This game is so creative It s really atypical and really exciting 
Not sure who this game is geared towards This is one of those games that can fall into multiple age catagories On one hand it looks purely like a kiddie game with cutesy poo characters and a Saturday morning cartoon feel On the other hand the dialog lots of it in this game is purely for adults with quite a few tongue in cheek risque jokes comments and situations WARNING Possible spoilers in next sentence Like what Beatrice does with the scuba gear and the main character getting high on mushrooms The cases are not very easy yet not very hard Some stories are so childish that I felt embarresed to be playing the game and some are so funny that I had to call someone over to read what was on the screen Then I was embarresed once again because I was asked why I was playing a little girl game That s the kind of game this is In short and regardless of the who the hell was this game made for dilemma I highly recommend it to anyone any age It s HIGHLY addictive extremely well written and a high quality point and click presentation 
True Review First off lemme just say that I am a nintendo fan I have been since I first got a NES system at years old in 1988 I have had every Nintendo home console since then and loved it I bought a GC in 2002 and really fell in love with it I eventually traded it with my brother for a computer dumb move Years later i bought another one used from a friend but never played it b c of school and sold it Well its 2006 and I am buying a gamecube as of today b c i miss it so much even after getting into PC games like World of Warcraft and Half Life Here s why 1 The system It is flawless I have never seen this system lock up or malfunction it reads every disk fine I clearly plays many multiplatform games such as Resident Evil 4 and Timesplitters 2 the best I like PS 2 games but the console itself is crap and a few good games on a console doesn t really give me enough reason to keep having to rebuy one b c they crap out XBOX is a good system but the games are nothing you can t really have on PS 2 besides Halo and KOTOR 2 The games Sure there are a lot of kid games on this system But there are many Teen and Mature games too many are available but aren t as obvious to find What is so amazing about the games are not only the truely wonderful one like Metroid Prime Zelda Mario RE4 etc but all of the great games that nobody ever really plays as much You will find many of these games on GC and they are cheap and probably more fun than most games you will ever play on any other console Some of these include Eternal Darkness Die Hard Vendetta wow i loved this game and there was zero advertising for it that i know of Killer 7 Agent Under Fire not as underground necessarily but this game is amazing Phantasy Star Online 1 2 Soul Caliber 2 etc If you really are into first person shooters don t even bother with XBOX Play PC games they are better graphically and seem easier to handle on a keyboard in my opinion If you want a load of fighting games like Tekken or Street Fighter PS 2 is good but like i said that system is really horrible designed even the new slimlines have problems Honestly I would pick up a PS 1 on ebay if you wanna play some great fighters like Tekken or King of Fighters If you want the best gameplay out of games for a great price get a gamecube I m telling you I know what your thinking You walk into a video store see Pikmin or Super Mario sunshine on gamecube and think psh what am i years old Looks can be deceiving and this system is amazing in all games and honestly pikmin had me rolling on the ground it was so oddball and fun I give the gamecube easily 5 stars it s never let me down for what it was meant for great games 
easy this game is alot of fun you get to play as a whole lot of places explore and beat pepole up finishing the game is easy expecially when you play multiplayer the only parts that are hard is where you haft to beat the fairygodmother at the end some levles you might find boring like the one with the three little pigs so i would recommend you buy this at a cheap price 
daughter loves it My husband just bought this for my five year old daughter preschool graduation gift She hasn t been able to leave it alone Now she s a little more advanced in the world of gaming than some her age and definitely better than me her mom so I can t recommend it for every kid but if your kid is adept at x box they should enjoy this one It doesn t hurt that she loves the movie as well 
Fun for kids and the not so hard core gamers We bought this for my 6 y o daughter to go with the X Box we bought for Christmas We have not owned a game system except for a game boy since the original Nintendo came out This game has been fun for us all We all play at the same time which makes for some family fun My daughter is able to play some alone without getting too frustrated and does well when we all play Personally I enjoy the comedic elements that have been well thought out If you are a hard core gamer you will probably get bored of it quickly It may not be as challenging as you like We have gotten over half way through without a cheat book which is amazing for most games 
kids humans i 37 played this game with my nephew 8 the other night on his birthday this is a Great game funny characters have great individual personalities traits just like ever with any cool game we started playing laughed alot lost track of time 1 hour had passed he was playing PS2 im buying it for my XBox tonight you should buy it for your system definitely worth it 
Ah the moonlight I feel romantic driving through the city in the rain with the moon in view Emotion on the dial I m ashamed to admit I spend most of my evenings helping the coppers chase down wannabe s in front of the mall 50 bucks a pop for a citizen s arrest and I just keep kicking em while they re down cha ching I ve bought all the properties with just the results of my do gooder vigilantism See this game rewards a higher sense of morality 
What you need to know about this game I loved this game It was well made and insanely broad in what you could do with it If you aren t phased by fantasy violence then you ll probably think the game is a lot of fun too But I will never let my children come within 10 feet of this game and you probably shouldnt either Here s why I fitting retitle of this game would be Scarface the Game because that s what a great deal of this game is modeled after an extremely violent movie about being a drug lord The game takes place in a realistic coastal city There are restaurants beaches hospitals hotels police depts grocery stores bars gas stations In fact the game was modeled after the locations and sights found in the movie Scarface The city is populated with pedestrians golfers shoppers people waiting to get on buses in cabs hookers gang members strippers drug dealers policemen emergency medical technicians bums store cashiers etc You can kill any one of these people You can solicit a prostitute and then run over her with your car as she gets out and leaves then take the money back that you paid her You can watch a strip show then shoot the stripper You can hack a pedestrian up with a chainsaw Throw a cab driver out of his cab then run him over with it You can perform drive by shootings You can start a gang war You can walk up to a car aim a rifle at an innocent driver and shoot them directly in the head and watch them fall out of the driver s seat You can drive around inside a shopping center and run over the shoppers You can distribute flyers for adult films that you re producing You can even start a massacre shooting then as the EMT s come to help people blow them up with a rocket launcher or simply beat them to death with a baseball bat You can become such a threat to the city that the National guard may appear with tanks helicopters and infantry Yes you can kill them too You don t have to do all this stuff In fact almost none of it is necessary in completing the main point of the game You simply have the freedom to do it if you desire to Or you could simply go through the basic missions of the game that involve an ex con s rise to power as a leader of a powerful mafia type drug cartel a la you guessed it Scarface Your kid will probably love it All in all for what it is it s extremely well made Of course if you are worried that violence etc found in video games could negatively affect your child then you should by no means let them anywhere near it 
Very sick but that s the fun No way should children be playing this game It is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players The goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it s just a fantasy Many people go into the details so I ll make this short Have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts But there s no way I would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then I would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy 
Don t you forget it I loved this game so much I have gone and got a second copy mine has stopped working I love the feeling that an entire world lives within the game and you can always just steal a car and ride listen to the radio and take in Vice City s many sites Tommy Vercetti excellantly cast as Ray Liotta of Goodfellas fame gets out of the slammer and goes back to his turf He gets sent to Vice City to get him out of the way because really they don t want him around anymore and they certainly don t want to answer his questions about why he got jailed You can ride bikes take cars helicopter fly over the city go through districts with different cultures and work for many gangs Bikers Columbians cops even accompanied by a sound track that beats the heck out of any other game I ve played A radio with enough variation to keep everyone happy as they do their drive bys and cruise looking at women And the talk shows Classy touch The game play is smooth and with barely a bug to be seen flows from day to night and back again with the city in sync Vice City at night is amazing you also get weather variations and the impact of that in the rain bikes tend to skid more and you fall off It s that kind of attention to detail that means the game never grows tiresome The hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi paramedic etc missions mean the game really is so open ended It s been three years and I m still exploring Vice City Classic 
Morrowind is fun and well worth the money I purchased a copy of the Game of the Year Edition at the end of May 2006 It is now almost September I have been playing Morrowind for three months most week day evenings for about 4 hours and most weekends for about 12 hours The game has great graphics the character interaction is fairly intricate though at times repetitive the game AI for the monsters and non player characters is fairly advanced the game manipulation was fairly easy to learn the layers of complexity can be somewhat challenging though not overwhelming and most importantly the one or two puzzles I have come across thus far were straightforward to resolve Most of the various quests are not terribly intricate and difficult to do so they lend themselves to jumping on for a few hours and then taking a break I wanted a game that would be visually appealing with simple game manipulation mechanics interesting but easy puzzles mysteries and above all to provide an immersive virtual world to explore And I wanted an inexpensive game and that would run on an older 900Mhz AMD Thunderbird with an NVIDIA FX5200 128MB video card and 1 GB of RAM Morrowind fits the bill nicely I have ignored all of the FAQs and manuals about how to play the game as most of those provide spoilers and instructions as to the most opportune or expedient path I have discussed the game with some of my students who have moved on to Oblivien the fourth game in the series All in all this was the best 20 bucks I have ever spent on a game Previous to this I have played Call of Duty and Civilization II extensively and some other strategy games a bit I did play Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends in college some 20 years ago so the fantasy ideas embedded in the game are familiar 
Morrowwind A Mr Craig Clotfelter wrote a review earlier that matches my sentiments exactly If you can get used to the controls and get by the early slowness this is an excellent game I havent beaten it yet and havent played it for a month or so computor went down you can do the main quest straight on or wander around building your character up I personally didnt start the main till I was about level 13 and even then took it slow and easy As you progress in the game ar wander the area new towns open up and I just sort of got new side quests as these areas opened up So I am taking my time It is a great game If you buy it and have patience you wont regret it 
Playing this after playing Oblivion This is the second Elder Scrolls game I ve played the first being Oblivion I really enjoyed Oblivion and decided to give this one a try and I must say I ve really enjoyed it so far Still on the main quest though right now I m gonna join the Morag Tong Now first off if you re an impatient type or really easily confused then this game is not for you This game takes time and patience to really enjoy One thing I did when I first started playing I paid attention to what people said and went where I was told to go I know it s a game that really gives you freedom to do what you want but for someone just starting out on the series just follow the main quest line and make sure to pay attention to what people say and just go where you need to Then once you ve become more accustomed to how things work then I d suggest exploring some You ll often come across people on the roads with quests they ll want to give you that ll often deviate from your current objective I would actually suggest helping them out as the journal is often enough to get you back on track afterwards Just remember to stay on the roads and look at every sign you come across so you know which way to go In closing if you have patience and are willing to put some serious time into the game then I d suggest getting this It s an older game and the graphics are clearly outdated but it can be quite an enjoyable experience In fact I m liking it more than Oblivion which had my attention for a few months No telling when I ll be done with this one 
Perhaps the best 20 bucks I ever spent Where to begin There is so much to say about this game because there is so much to do This game is massive I just recently picked it up and I cannot believe I waited this long to play it I heard a lot of good things about Morrowind from friends and online reviews it is confirmed I am hooked on this games There are a few important things to point out about it however as this game is definitly not for everyone Yes this is an adventure RPG and a massive one It is not in the same format as games such as Final Fantasy Chrono Trigger Star Ocean ect sure it takes quite some time to get to your destination if you have to travel a long distance but this game is in real time and the island is massive not to mention there are so many lairs scattered around the world which makes for a TON of exploration on top of your already robust agenda The character customization in this game is on par if not better than all other character customization tools I have used in a single player PC RPG With this in mind this game takes at least some commitment I have been able to advance my Nord Battle Mage just fine even though I have somewhat of a busy schedule you do not need to have 24 hours free but it is still good to play it when you can because it has a habit of calling out to you saying play me play me it is adicting You choose your own path in this game If you are into fantasy character development a real time environment and a sense of adventure this game just may be what you are looking for 
Best RPG Definitely Best Game Ever Maybe Part of the Elder Scrolls series Morrowind takes the live action adventure of games like the Zelda series and overlays it with a more traditional role playing stat system ala Dungeons and Dragons To elaborate the player can freely explore the expansive 3D world in first person or third person mode while practicing and improving their character s skill set In combat for example rather than trying to work your way through a menu system trying to cast magic and use attack moves etc Final Fantasy anyone the player must physically aim and swing a sword or fire a spell at his opponent Whether or not the bow lands is based on things like the player s agility and the bad guy s block skill Thus unlike in a game such as say Fable the action doesn t depend as much on the player s own reflexes and dexterity A little common sense and caution goes a long way Also don t expect lots of elaborate teary eyed cut scenes like in story driven games such as Final Fantasy The real draw to this game is the complete freedom the player has to be whoever they want go anywhere they like and do almost anything within reason The player is asked to choose a name race gender face and hairstyle for their character and also to create a basic skill set to use any combination from combat magical and stealth categories Then the player is given some simple instructions for beginning the first task of the main quest and is simply released into a massive world of towns people and wilderness There is a main quest to follow but the gameplay is completely open ended It s easy to become completely distracted by and caught up in the endless guild quests and random adventures that await your character Personally I ve been playing this game for about two and a half years now and I ve still not accomplished everything there is to do in this game I m not sure that I can even describe the depth of this game in this review I ve literally spent hours just trying on different clothes and armor creating my own spells and potions or reading the books both factual and fictional in the game s libraries and I d like to add that almost anything read about in a book can be found or done in the game I ve also spent literally days of gameplay searching for the various legendary and unique artifacts and trying to uncover the various mysteries of the game such as solving the disappearance of the dwarves finding the cure for vampirism locating or becoming a werewolf and how to become a necromancer some of which I ve found or am close to finding I ve played most if not all the Zelda games I ve played Fable I ve played games like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy and I ve even played text rpg s like ADOM They all have their good points and advantages and I ve greatly enjoyed them all but none of them not even Majora s Mask have held my attention this long The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is the best role playing game I ve ever played and maybe just maybe the best game I ve ever played overall 
Great GameCube memory card This is a great memory card for people with only a few GCN games but those who have a bigger collection will either need to buy two or the GCN Memory Card 1019 
it was a memory card My kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it 
If you like to get down This game is great My 4 year old enjoys trying to keep up and gets super excited whenever she gets an A I love to do this when I don t feel like going to the gym It s great fun and a quick sweat Thirty minutes of this and your done My workout buddy came over for dinner last week and my daughter wanted her to play I told her to play for her workout she didn t think it would make her sweat But oh boy was she sweating quickly The only con to this is the controllers if I could just get good enough to not land on the wire box I am shopping around for a new one right now 
Good exercise This is a fun game for young and older folks It is also a great way to exercise without the monotony of scrunches etc It is a little awkward at first to navigate the set up procedure but once you catch on the fun begins even for 50 somethings like me 
Variety and fun too I have the first version of this game but got the newer one which is even more fun It has several more challenges levels styles and variety I haven t yet tried them all but it s worth the because of the different games and players you get Plus you can unlock different musi and play with your hands too Both my 13 yr old son and I are enjoying the exercise we get with it and this version is very similar to the arcade one so we practice and then go to the arcade and can get our monies worth 
My favorite PS2 game I love this game I haven t played other DDR games before so I m not sure how it compares to others but this one is great Some of the songs I like a lot and some I don t but they re all a challenge and fun in some way I like to use the Dance Master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well I haven t made it all that far because I play the same levels over and over again because they re so fun This game is great for people of all ages and includes music for the young and old 
Fun and Addicting DDR Extreme 2 is a very fun game I just bought it yesterday and I am already used to it It is very easy to catch on to You simply press the arrows on a dance mat when they reach the arrows on the top of the screen On free play the levels are from easiest to hardest Beginner Light Standard and Heavy I after a day of use am already working on some songs on the light level The higher the level the faster and more complicated footwork Some of my favorite songs are Butterfly upswing My My My Boom Boom Dollar Captain Jack and Get Busy If you have two dance mats you can connect them and compete against a friend or even harder yet dance by yourself using two mats I highly recommend Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 to anyone who would like some highly addictive fun while getting into shape 
THUG 2 A breakthrough in skateboarding and general sports games Now I m new to the Tony Hawks s series in fact the only time I ve played it before THUG was in a demo which I enjoyed but not so much the tasks of collecting the letters and stuff like that even though for those who love that type of stuff they have a classic version of the original Tony Hawks in THUG 2 These games offer the ever insightful approach of exploring your world on and off the skateboard Especially THUG 2 since THUG I returned it on the same day I got it for Christmas merely because I felt dizzy until I got the same feeling for THUG 2 but then I realised you got all songs not just rock but hip hop as well as few others Anyways the story is intriguing and you travel the world doing various tasks such as breaking pipes and skating combos in a church The possibilities are endless plus for you alien lovers out there you can unlock an outer space world plus many others In short not the best review you ve seen true but the game is much more to than just skating which is great did I mention you can switch characters from Tony himself to Bigfoot Dila 
A good game unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game and the story mode is a bit weak however they make up in that with the classic mode and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase i reccomend you buy this rather than THUG1 or THAW I garantee you will enjoy this game for a while 
Not at all a bad game THUG 2 Came out last year and was a pretty popular game What I liked about the game is how they included older levels with updated graphics The game doesn t last long you can easily beat it but if you re a huge fan you can still play for hours on end even after it s beaten You can play online too which is a lot of fun and I think it adds to the excellence of this game more so THPS or THUG fan Buy this 
ILLEST TONY HAWK GAME IVE EVER PLAYED Well what can i say this was one of da BEST Tony Hawk Video Games too date I mean the plot is sick in its on right You create ur own custom skater whoo goes from bein a street skater too a national skateboardin icon but this game switches its style and plot from The first installment of the T H U G In this installment your picked bye the birdman himslef too lead your team in the world destruction tour which i think is one of da illest ideas U Gotta face up against no one other then Skateboard Bad Boy Himself Bam Margera who in my personal opinion I have been a big fan of Bam and his possie ever since the CKY Video Days And now too have them as Main Charachters in this game is awsome Its Like you got the normal Tony Hawk Skate Team and Then the whole Viva La Bam Cast Aswell Its Just Amazing The Story mode is the best ive seen yet in the Franchise This game is so Addictingly Fun I Recommend this Game 100 Personally i think this title would of fit it so much better Tony Hawks Underground 2 World Destuction Tour PS The newest installment of the Tony Hawk Franchise Just Dropped 3 Days Ago Tony Hawks American Wasteland And too tell you the truth i think this game is still a little bit better maybe its just because this game had the whole Viva La Bam cast in it too give it that crazy feel But To me this is still the undisputed Champ of thhe Tony Hawk Franchise FOR NOW 
Its an ok game I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok 
2 great Final Fantasies from the SNES era These 2 games are probably in my opinion anyway the best ones in the series I will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself FF5 One of the previously unreleased FF games at the time anyway is now in America I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof I literally trained my characters this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game to get to level 30 or 40 can t remember exactly just to get my jobs mastered the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of X Death rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him her instead of the one who is destroying the world the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters there s only 5 in the entire game you stick with 4 one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters FF6 I think this is the best one in the series there is absolutly no real Main character in this game For those who are confused what I mean is that well for example FF7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is Cloud the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader The characters are excellent in this game I pretty much like all of them Gau is funny but he doesn t have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you can t even control them at all during battle Sabin having the Blitz ability for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move no matter which direction your facing you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction for instance one of the moves is RLR I am talking about Right Left Right on the control pad and if your character is facing to the right then you have to insert that command but if you are facing the opposite direction it is still the same command not the opposite combination when I first beat the game before beating it I got all of the characters to level 99 This game also has some of the best music for a FF game at the time anyway the collection itself you get a music CD the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8 s random battle loading screen FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies has CGI cinemas FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES or should I say Super Famicom version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features overall If you like the SNES FF games this is the right collection for you Along with Chronicles which includes FF4 FF2 in the USA for the SNES and Chrono Trigger 
A Good Investment Two great RPG s in one package Playstation owners who began Final Fantasy with the 7th installment can finally see what all the hype is about with VI Final Fantasy V is also a great game the first in the series where you spend alot of time in the menu combining abilities with accessories equipment to customize your characters The only downside is the short load times when entering battles opening the menu entering new levels However these never last more than a few seconds Whether you re discovering the SNES generation of Final Fantasy for the first time or re visiting the classics Final Fantasy Anthology offers a great gaming experience that you can only get on a console 
Greatest Hits version is lackluster Don t get me wrong both games in Anthology are excellent I would consider Final Fantasy VI to be the greatest RPG ever created But the Greatest Hits version of this package does dissapoint The original black label version of Anthology was created by SquareSoft and included in the package was an extra CD with music from both games However the black label edition has been out of print for some time The newly formed company Square Enix decided to re release Anthology as a Greatest Hits but excluded the music CD in the package So instead of receiving three disks the two gaming disk and one music CD only the two game disks are included with the game The Square Enix release of Anthology feels much more like a cheap cut and paste copy of Final Fantasy Besides lack of the music CD much of the artwork from the previous black label release is gone and instead the gaming disks are designed with a standard white label Final Fantasy Anthology from Square Enix is certainly not a collector s item despite what the package label might say It is my suggestion to pass this purchase up and find a copy of the black label release from SquareSoft 
Probably The Best Game I Ever Owned For The PS1 I no longer play video games though I have recently started back on computergames but I had to review this great set You get two games Fianl Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 First let us look at FF5 FF5 was never released in the states officialy but Squaresoft now called SquareEnix has unleashed it upon us all It s story isn t the greatest but it s not about story here it s all about gameplay This is the main reason that this is my favourite in the series The job class is indepth and gives you a lot of options here This improves upon the already great job class of FF3 not FF6 and only comes insecond to the job class system found in Dragon Warrior 3 and Dragon Warrior 7 I also like the size if this game there are three different worlds here and they are all good size I also love the main villian s name X Death and his final form and name Neo X Death There are a lot more good things that make this game great but I ll let you discover them FF6 is also a solid game and introduced some of the things that would be found in later FF games One thing is the indepth stories and multiple characters to play with Even though a lot fans like to say that FF7 had got the best villian in the series I and many others dissagree Kefka is jst pure evil incarnate I m not going into details so you yourself will have to find all the little things that make him such the awesome bad guy that he is It s just a great game If you don t mind 2 D graphics and old games then do yourself a favoure and get this fine set now 
nothing else can touch it FFVI is the end all best game ever created The story line is simply out of this world The game grips you from the beginning and never lets go The interaction between the main characters is incredible The game creates the most haunting mood of any game ever released despite the now primitive graphics and sound I have gone years without playing the game before but the story environments villains and even some of the music would still stand out in my mind This game simply leaves an impression on you unlike any other video game ever could After playing through it every other game out there just seems void of content No other Final Fantasy installment can touch this one FFVII is a distant second This will likely remain the best game ever created unless it is completely remade with today s technology but even that is questionable as the SNES graphics give an incredible atmosphere to the game anyway My only complaint with this particular title is the result of its adaption to the Playstation The new cinema cut scenes do not come even remotely close to doing this game justice Some of the sound didn t carry over well either and the addition of load times isn t exactly a welcome one Despite these shortcomings it s still the complete game which is all that matters FFVI was absolutely breathtaking in every aspect when it was released and remains so to this day The story the music the characters and the gameplay are still better than anything today s games have to offer Anyone who has yet to experience this incredible adventure is only keeping themselves from one of the most engaging stories ever 
Great Game Totally Fun Yes this game is an easier fighting game but that s why I like it personally In most Marvel fighting games there are so many controls to remember for activating many different types of superpowers that it got hard to keep em straight With this game having only 2 basic fight options for all characters it is much easier to figure out what you are doing Of course each character has it s little extras such as flight for Storm and wall climbing for Spidey so each character remains unique But you don t have to memorize 10 different actions for Wolverine and then memorize 10 different controls for Venom I like this game a lot and I really love that they have made the fighting controls easier 
All RIGHT Phew I m relieved to be able to recommend this game I ve played them all in order And I really didn t enjoy the last two so I was a bit concerned But Her Interactive got a lot of things right in this one Interesting mystery with the puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into the plot Not too much repetition of tasks hooray The only reason it wasn t perfect for me was that I really didn t learn too much My favorite games are the ones where I walk away with a bit more knowledge of something than I had before going in And this one not so much I also had a small objection to the ending The treasure so to speak was completely out of the park There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking And as a history buff I hated seeing such a treasure indeed relegated to the back burner and used as a throw away at the very end 
Fast moving This game was great It s easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast In this one Nancy is on a train that might be haunted Lori Girard your host invites a bunch of people including Frank and Joe Hardy you actually get to play as Frank in one part of the game Then odd things start happening on the train Lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train s emergency brake is pulled This is a really fun game 
A Train Bound For Adventure Nancy Drew Last Train To Blue Moon Canyon 13 Before I Begin My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in depth look at that topic If you hate reading medium long reviews or just don t have the patience I would not continue reading but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you ll continue Gameplay Interface This is a point and click mystery the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use They also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game The hands manipulate items or add them to your Inventory Toolbox When playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a Inventory Depicted as a toolbox which I think should be a backpack instead a Camera Cell phone and a Journal Help and a Menu Button Other games have a Coin Purse when money is used in the game The Main Menu is pretty simple However the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you can t delete saved games It also prompts you about your decision it makes saving rewriting games take more than one click For this type of game the interface is perfect but I ll knock off a star for the irritating save load page Plot A fairly used plot in this series finding treasure But Her Interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting Jake Hurly a miner and owner of a custom built train falls in love with a young French woman named Camille on the way to finding gold Camille later dies Jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now haunted train is found out in out in the Nevada desert with the engineer dead Many years later Lori Girard Daddy s little fame seeking rich girl finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to Copper Gorge Colorado She invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to Jake Hurley and where his mine is using the clues Jake left on the train A pretty simple treasure story This series often uses that story but in different ways now turned into a intriguing mystery good work Her Interactive The game also has some side mysteries like Lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake Both happen to be publicity stunts But you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened What I didn t like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed The very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is The Jake Hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub plot s weren t very exciting Characters I loved the characters but you couldn t really interact with them as much Lori Girard was one of my favorite characters I loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting Nancy s name Since Lori is the hostess she was probably the main character Tino Baldcucci is a great character as well He is a Private Investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time He is as conceited as Lori you ll probably interact with him a lot more than John Grey John Grey is the first black male to be in this series he is the host of Ghost Hunters a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts He s a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately Then there is Charleena Purcell a romance novelist introduced in Nancy Drew Secret Of Shadow Ranch 10 who is nice and very smart She is in the process of making her book that s on a deadline who you ll find out used one of Lori s story ideas in her latest book without permission I like her better now then when she was in ND 10 to bad she has no memory of that game And finally there is Frank Joe Hardy These teenage brothers work for American Teens Against Crime ATAC and who were invited because their dad was friends with Lori s dad The boys were nice enough to invite Nancy along as well I personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as Frank as a short order cook They really don t have much to do with the case they are just a good source of info I am looking forward to playing as them more in Nancy Drew Creature Of Kapu Cave 15 I really didn t like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game But when you did interact at times it was really fun That s something to add to ND 16 and beyond Setting Graphics I love being on a train the feel was so exciting Seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great The cars were so detailed and beautiful I think my favorite place in the train was the Projection Car Later you stop at Copper Gorge a little town in Colorado There was the mysterious crypt and a Museum Taffy Shop that was cheesy but enjoyable The crypt was small and there wasn t much to do but I mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn The graphics were great Very realistic Its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better This was probably the most unique setting in the series I personally love trains boats and planes so this made me really happy Puzzles Activities The puzzles were fairly easy I liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where Jake s mine is What was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles There were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying You also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones tools duct tape a pen and other stuff I don t understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with Tino to get a simple pen Some of the puzzles were unique like Camille s doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step playing Camptown Races on the piano and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale But some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations a word search and a two memory games This game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score Ending Once you find out where Jake s Mine your sent off there to get a head start for a treasure You d think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else You open the entrance memorize a couple things follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized Not that difficult if you are smart Then you find the treasure and your so called culprit You wouldn t know this person is the culprit when he she finds you in the mine and talks to you but then he she loses trust in you and you get caved in Then you get out I thought this was fun to do felt like a roller coaster to stop the culprit I liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy Although the culprit was kind of obvious I liked what the culprit s plan or goal was Overall it was good ending yet a little easier than I thought it should have been Overall This was one of the better Nancy Drew games out there Definitely one to add to your shelf The flaws in this game don t affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different The plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it I enjoyed this game a lot after I played it more than two times I think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience Some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts The repetition of some of the puzzles isn t too bad This game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best Nancy Drew game It really depends on your opinion Add all these up and divide by 6 4 s Gameplay Interface 4 s Plot 4 s Characters 5 s Setting Graphics 3 s Puzzles 4 s Ending = 24 Stars Divide By 6 Categories = 4 Stars Thanks for reading 
Clue Chronicles Fatal Illusion I absolutely loved this game I couldn t stay off my computer it was addicting The game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking It was very entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery I can t wait until the next one comes out 
Short but Sweet Great uncomplicated game with decent graphics and just the right amount of quot spookiness quot I loved the puzzles which weren t overly difficult to solve and the HINT system was very very good in helping me get over one or two puzzles which did not seem to make sense The marble in the hole game was a little irritating but all other puzzles were solvable even on a trial and error basis This game is probably not for people who like complex plots and puzzles but as a game novice I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed when the game ended a little abruptly 
Nice way to continue series NBA ballers phenom is a great game and is really fun to play What midway basically did was advance or fix the original NBA ballers who stared Stephon Marbary Midway made the graphics better gameplay better a litte more extra moves and nice layout The layout looks cool and is way better then how it used to look The reason why I give this game a 4 star rather then 5 star is the loading the game itself Ok I have to admit the loading is pretty long but its all worth it What I mean about the game itself is that its more for teens I mean the whole thing of ballers I am not sure kids under 10 understand what it means and how to bring it in the game The original NBA ballers I would say is more for kids but since midway enhanced this game rather then change the whole thing I would say It is a blast for teens 13+ So what I am getting too is if you are under the age of 12 or 13 wait until AND 1 Streetball comes out But if your over 13 years of age then then go out and grab a copy of this game cause its a blast you 
Incredible Awesome video games but a little strange things Story A family of super heroes battle against a weird bad guy named Syndrome Characters Mr Incredible Elastigirl Violet Dash Unplayable characters Jack Jack Frozone Syndrome Mirage Graphics OK but I really don t like the Apartment Inferno level because alot of the scenes most of them are dark and you can t see a thing Levels in order Bank Heist Skyline Strech Buddy Pine and Bomb Voyage Apartment Inferno Late for School Beach Landing Nomanisian Island Lava level with Omnidroid Robot Arena Great Falls Syndrome s Base Finding Mr Incredible 100 Mile Dash Violet s Crossing Secret Lava Falls Rocket Silo Save the World Overall A great game I would buy it if I were you 
Game for Kids or Adults I bought this game for my nephew and he loved it I haven t played it but my sister apparently has everytime I call her she s playing 
God of GORE This Game is AWSOME It is way too graphic for kids so parents no matter how much they beg DON T BUY IT Even the story is too adult for them It is a very interesting puzzle action and adventure game If you are a occational gamer set it to easy and dig in because you can get the hang of it with a little practice The puzzles require a little brain power so be ready for vex sometimes 
Non stop action This game is awesome Definately a 10 10 There is constant action and you can upgrade your abilities and weapons to become stronger with added effects If you re into games like Devil May Cry or just love hack n slash you need to pick this one up 
One of the best action games PERIOD You ve read a lot of reviews to get to this one most likely and they ve gone on about how great it looks it does look tremendous how fantastic the gameplay is it is awe inspiring and how just absolutely great of a gaming experience it is There are a few things that I would like to add First off there is one slight problem with the game Personally with action games of the 3rd person variety I like to be able to control the camera This game does not have that Instead you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see This is a very slight complaint and one I m hoping will be improved with GOD OF WAR II The second thing that I would like to add is that the Mythological aspect of this game is GREAT It really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games It s the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would It s a tremendously entertaining and oft times thought provoking game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice em dice em games of this type get to Get it 
My 2 cents Okay if you don t know this game rocks by now I feel sorry you so I just want to warn parents that it is violent so please if you have a problem with that don t buy it for your kids otherwise why don t you already have it 
God of War is great This game is great Can t wait for God of War 2 
Believe the hype For all you non believers out there BUY THIS GAME I was like you reading the reviews looking at the box in various stores pondering considering thinking to myself should I buy this game Now that I finally spent the mere 20 and played the game I am wondering why I didn t do so sooner As an avid Playstation supporter Stood in line for hours and paid over 600 for my PS2 back in the day this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment Cinematically driven storyline supurbly coordinated character control creative levels and character design great soundtrack decent bosses pretty cool power moves and importantly puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns In closing all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review BUY THIS GAME 
not quite what I expected The advertising for this collection led me to believe I would be getting these 7 games in their original formats but I was disappointed to find not the original version of KQ1 but the SCI version released in 1990 KQ6 has voice commentary instead of text but you can switch back to text if you like I haven t found any such option for KQ5 so it looks like you re stuck with the voice and no supplemental text either so it gets annoying fast I haven t had a look at KQ4 yet but everything else seems to be the same I ll be glad to play these games without having to wrestle with our old Tandy but I wish they didn t get messed with Especially disappointed with there being no text option for KQ5 
A must for KQ fans but very disappointing quality I ve been counting down until I could get this release and couldn t wait to play all these great games again When I got it and started playing it was fun but the disappointment kept mounting Little things like no manuals you have open a file and or print them yourself not a big deal in itself but come on Vivendi quit being so cheap and no case for the CDs you just get twopaper sleeves make the package look incredibly cheap and low quality Yes these are computer games from the 80s and early 90s but this package could have been put together better The graphics are the same as the originals so I didn t expect any update there I completed KQ6 and 1 with no problems but KQ5 is annoying because you can t go back to text or at least I haven t figured out how The music overpowers what the characters are saying Any of the problems you had with the previous games such as difficult maneuvering remain the same which is to be expected Overall I guess my disappointment comes from the fact that Vivendi COULD have made a really nice package with this added some extras beefed it up included more information stuff like that Especially with how long it took to get this going How many times was the release date pushed back But no it s a bare minimim cheapo production I know it s only 20 but still could have been a lot nicer Still a must for any KQ fan and tons of fun to play but I am ultimately disappointed with this product 
good RPG puzzle solving game I bought Contact based on positive hype without knowing much about it at all I m not disappointed Contact has proven to be a very enjoyable distraction for me ever since it came out The premise of the game is that you are helping a boy called Terry who is moored on a deserted island with a wacky professor You are communicating with the professor via your DS and guiding Terry s movements although he doesn t know you re there Terry s mission is to help the professor find his ship s fuel cells while solving mysteries and puzzles fighting bad guys and gaining skills In this sense the game is just like most RPGs but I believe that the level of gameplay is more sophisticated than your typical Final Fantasy or Zelda type venture Many elements of the game are borrowed from those successful series but they are also combined with puzzle game elements and even life simulation elements such as those of Harvest Moon Terry recharges energy by eating food he finds there are many different sorts sleeping in his bed or taking a warm bath He can fight enemies using weapons he picks up And he can find and interact with items and clues that help him complete his quest and go back home One of the cutest features is that he can acquire and change into outfits that enable him to use skills like cooking It s not difficult to get used to the intuitive game play especially after a brief read through the instructions You can be at home equally using the stylus or the console buttons What was interesting to me is that Terry can collect and stick on different decals that produce various effects and you even peel the decals off their backings like in real life although using the stylus Overall this is a very interesting kind of game and one that makes full use of the DS s unique capabilities such as dual screens If you re a fan of any of the genres mentioned above you won t be disappointed by Contact 
freedom to explore I love the way this game gives you the freedom to walk around everywhere You can have over 15 different weapons which makes the gameplay far more interesting than I d ever imagined You can change into different clothes which actually is important in helping you progress through the game It s not a normal style of gameplay but an interesting one to say the least While it s hardly the best game you can find on the market it s certainly unique 
Rented it liked it gonna buy it I rented Contact from GameFly and played it for a few days before deciding that I am going to purchase it in the not too distant future Unfortunately GameFly does not rent games along with instruction manuals so I had to learn everything in game by trial and error Even so I was doing pretty well if I do say so myself and had to stop myself from playing anymore so I wouldn t waste the purchase later It reminded me of other RPG type games I ve played in the past such as NES original Zelda If you liked Zelda you ll probably like this game But buy it or borrow from a friend who ll loan you the manual too To have that help may make all the difference 
Episode II What Are You a Moron One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep II s battle system is annoying and ponderous because even in regular battles it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies This is actually a form of codespeak What these people are really saying is I m not very bright and even after several hours of playing Ep II I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently Ep II puts a great deal of emphasis on each character s attack attributes Attacks are classified as either Physical or Ether and then there are elementals fire ice lighting aura and finally there are types slash pierce hit Sound complicated Eh a little more so than the average RPG Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you re unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack When you come across enemies with Physical elemental weaknesses there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character s physical attack If their weakness is ether elemental then just use the standard elemental spell Ethers against them This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice normal pace For some reason the vast majority of Ep II players seemed to never realize this Instead they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine NINE turns in a row before beginning their attack Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters They took no heed of enemy weaknesses using characters with physical fire based attacks against enemies weak vs ether ice RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers I wonder what happened A lot of Ep I fans never bothered to play Ep II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released But now that Ep III is out and it s truly fantastic a lot of them will finally play Ep II soon I hope they do better than the first rounders did 
Xenosaga Episode 2 THIS PREVIEW HAS SPOILERS OF THE GAME PLEASE DON T READ IT IF YOU DIDN T PLAY IT I played Xenogears and when i saw Xenosaga Episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an introduction OK improvements Gameplay was Longer than Episode 1 I ended Episode 1 with everything in 42 hours in change Ep2 88+ Sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways The Idea of Epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that Chaos Jr Momo Shion Kosmos Looking was improved they looked more grow up Battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double Tech attacks All Characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests Momo Bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good Damage Dealer Recover Mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble People complain because history was focus in Jr and URTVs but the title says itself Jenseits von Gut und B se means Beyond Good and Evil wich means Rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his Red Dragon mode wich makes him go out of control possible reason of Sakura Death Albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well Nigredo wich refused to do a mission involved with Rubedo and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said Giving life from 1 hand and delivering death from the other Honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going What they did wrong I don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea Good Thing they added the tech attacks special attacks in ep 3 You had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters wich made battles kinda boring Music in battle was kinda boring compare to Ep 1 Voices of Chaos sounded boring Kos Mos like Fake silly girl trying to play as a robot Shion Pushing and like I m better than you Momo Very Annoying sad thing is my main team is Chaos Kosmos Momo thats why i got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode 1 in the third and last episode Ep 1 has almost 8 hours of movies Ep 2 4 30hours i guess for the complains of the long movies I still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things Xenosaga has over most of the games In Episode 3 is 4hours of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like Valkyrie Profile They cut completly the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting they fix that in ep3 In Resume as everyone know Episode 2 had bad things but as well good things as every game no they shouldn t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself Good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of Episode 2 to Episode 3 Battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing i didn t like of episode 3 battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system attack ether tech special tech and others so forget the 4 combinations to make a tech attacks ethers cost ep cp special attacks cost boosts i wonder if attack will give some ep cp later Even with all this i recommend you to buy it before you get episode 3 because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost 20 dollars each or less Atte Roy_Master 
My two cents As I read the previous reviews and other reviews about this games I had to agree with some and disagree with others I like the whole story line of the game It gave us insight into the history of Jr and Gaignun and Shion I was very disappointed with the overall combat system I liked changing characters in the middle combat like in FF X but I miss the ability to hit the enemies with special weapons like in the first episode I was also disappointed with the way the creators changed the way to build the characters from the first episode to the second I liked having characters with different abilities It added diversity to building a strong team I didn t care too much for the Good samaritan side quests I didn t like having to go all over the place to pick up stuff vital to the development of my characters or to advance the game The ability to have two characters attack during combat using special attacks was interesting even though I didn t use it much As far as the characters themselves I agree with another reviewer about Shion I also found her to be bossy and cold In certain scenes I found her to be too emotional Most of her lines near the end were completely out of place especially at the end after Jr s showdown with Albedo I was disappointed when my most favorite NPC Gaignun was possessed but that s just me I agree with one reviewer about the voice for MOMO although I did like some of her lines I was very happy the creator took away her wand and give her weapon It made her very useful in combat chaos was too laid back for me in this game and KOS MOS was too much on the vain side I did like how the reaction between Shion and Jin or KOS MOS before combat starts Overall the game was enjoyable to play Once I got pass the disappointing aspects of the game I found it to very entertaining 
Increadible The Perfect Christmas Game I went to my local game store to buy a game to get me into the christmas spirit Obviously when I asked for a christmas game the first thing that the woman behind the counter said was The Polar Express I saw the movie last year and loved it so I immediately bought the game and went home to play it I beat the game in aboout 4 hours went to sleep and when I got up beet it again It wasnt exactly that it was a short game as much as it was totally fun and addictive I m 15 the age where most teenagers play violent video games and I am sorry to say that I am one of them The game blends everything from racing down a snowey mountain to climbing the presents in santas sleigh and flying a blimp To put my review simply this is the best christmas game possible 
Polar Express live the magic every day We just saw the wonderful movie and picked up the game on the way home I m 39 years old and terrible at games This game is sweet and lots of fun Food fights soccer searching for things If I can do it anyone can Merry Christmas one and all 
SMALL AMMOUNT OF QUESTIONS THIS GAME LACKS QUESTIONS AND REPEATS THEM OVER AND OVER 200 QUESTIONS MORE LIKE 40 BUT REGIS IS HILARIOUS BUT THE FASTEST FINGER IS WAY OFF I HAVE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS EXCEPT THE LACK OF QUESTIONS AND THE FF ROUND 
More Game Functionality The Jedi additions are outstanding Better game feel and play but the flying can be challenging Not sure if I am not yet used to it but it is taking some time getting used to it to be able to fly and understand how to avoid death 
This game rocks Yes I am a die hard Star Wars fan and yes I love a good mission based action game so man if this isn t the perfect game for me It s so much fun and there s so much freedom in the game in itself Add on to that the space missions and Wow this game totally blows me away Highly recommended for anyone who is a Star Wars fan a FPS fan or a fan of fun gameplay 
experienced gamer I ve had this game since it first came out and I am still not sick of it I think anyone that enjoys the Halo multiplayer would enjoy this game Lucasarts improved just about everything you can think of from the first Battlefront The story mode and galactic conquest strategy mode are excellent additions to the basic Battlefront where you simply take over bases and kill the enemy but thank goodness they still kept that in this game I do miss some of the old scenarios but a lot of the new scenarios are really good and the new controls make Battlefront II totally worth playing I love the improved controls new characters and the new space battles The ability to sprint is an ingenious addition In most games you can walk or run In this game the characters have the ability to run very fast by sprinting They can also kneel lay dive and roll I hope all future action games adopt this I do wish the characters had the ability to punch someone after all they can do just about everything else The ability to change your character at bases you control is a nice addition Engineers with the ability to repair things or take over occupied enemy vehicles is great There is a nice array of weapons and the ability to play as specialized characters such as Darth Vader or Boba Fett is awesome The space battles are really fun except when you board the enemy ship there is only limited areas that you have access to The graphics are great in HD Pros Controls ability to sprint change characters at bases engineers that repair things and steal enemy vehicles graphics multiple scenarios a lot of characters play as specialty characters jedi space battles multiple playing options strategy mode story mode and basic Battlefront mode Cons characters don t have the ability to punch someone boarding an enemy ship in a space battle has very limited access to the enemy ship Some of the fun scenarios from the first Battlefront are not in this one The option of flying multiple ships playing multiple characters using turrets in both space battles and regular battles and all of the multiple things your characters can do make this game worth playing 
freakin sweet this game is just freakin awesome im not that big into video games and i really only play them when i have someone to play against i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack then came duty i played this game through on all the difficulty modes from medium up and never got bored plus if you ve got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking multiplayer is sweet esp if you break up into teams and you can talk smack all day long best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen 
Amazing game couldn t put it down Great game higly addictive and gets really tuff once you play on veteran s mode Definately a game to have in your collection 
It takes some getting used to but then it really starts going I love the FPS genre There s just something about running around and blowing things away that relieves the day s stress That said if you re new to the CoD games like I was then there s some adjustment to be had It s not a straight run and gun kind of game For one varying degrees of movement and strategy are required to get at your enemies without getting taken out Second if you re used to a plasma gun with 400 rounds then the frequent reloading of historical weapons will take some getting used to But all this adds to the great interface graphics and especially storyline of this great game I can t wait for Call of Duty 3 
One flaw in multiplayer The only flaw I can find in this game is that the multiplayer isn t very much fun Playing locally with a friend means you just shoot him a lot while he learns the controls No enemy AIs in the maps 
Great game Buy call of duty 3 in november This game is amazing the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode Sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle One time I was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game Only three shots will kill you I HAD TO restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it 
COD2 is packed with awesome WW2 action Call of Duty 2 puts you in the role of three different people Vasili John Davis and Bill Taylor during three highly intense but different WW2 campaigns You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes so in otherwords its a first person shooter Anyway you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks MP40s M1 Garands Thompsons etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks Ontop of that you get smoke frag grenades to toss around at will There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun you pick a team ie British Nazis Americans you get it and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room snipe out mortar teams fend off a massive German counterattack or place a bomb on something Its pretty fun and intense because you ll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels I want to stress the word intense on this game You will always be on your toes always firing at hordes of enemies This game isn t easy even on the easy difficulty and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc if you think Medal of Honor Frontline s Arnhem Knights level is difficult wait till you see this Also this game is pretty long so don t try rushing it hah Moving on you ll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt France Russia and even Germany I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close and the character models look amazing However the levels feel kind of linear You are pretty limited as to where you can go but I guess we can look past that The sound effects were great I really loved the explosions The voice acting was great and actually helpful because your allies would be like Kraut on the 2nd floor black building and basically point out enemies to you What lowered this game from being a 9 Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death Ontop of that the guns weren t very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over got up and shot me again Meh Also like I mentioned the objectives started to get repetitive The ending was kind of a rip off at first a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won but once the credits roll the real ending begins It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks nazis and airplanes It was like watching a movie To sum it all up if you got an X Box 360 then you need to play this game It isn t the best in my opinion but it sure is a lot of fun Go buy it 
Revolutionary for me Let me explain oh my friends Little history Started playing shooters on PC when I was a youngin Quake was the first Quake II followed III Unreal Unreal Tournament A few lesser titles in between All multiplayer mind you Since I was a kid there was always something so divinely mind boggling about being able to link up different machines at that time computers and not only participate but kill your friends with ultra cool weapons and the like in literally a universe outside our own And truly is there anything cooler It s like psychically connecting with your friends in a lucid dream only peppered with a concrete universe filled with its own physics and laws The point of divuldging into this intimate joy of mine on paper Ever since I ve been introduced to this experience of multiplayer I have pretty much neglected single player in all games like a deformed foster child with epilepsy So why is Call of Duty 2 for Xbox 360 revolutionary for a gamer such as myself It converted me From what you ask From PC to console I defiantly backed my beliefs console could not and hadn t objective fact I d say come close to the PC in regards to multiplayer gaming First person shooters only solidified the argument For one you ve got a mouse which undeniably offers a more precise degree of control I played Mario Brothers on a controller but after playing Goldeneye on Nintendo 64 whenever I attended a friends house way back when I shuddered with disgust A controller couldn t touch what I was used to not to mention the fact that you re playing on a full screen with a computer at a very accomplished speed opposed to split screen on the console which had one dared play four player reached framerates of dire levels not unlike viewing screenshots on the net and I exaggerate only slightly So here comes Call of Duty 2 for the Xbox 360 For starters I only bought the system because a friend convinced me and I was actually impulsive about it which I m usually not Had Project Gotham Racing for a while which was actually pretty fun online if a bit hard and I was never into racing games Few weeks later I bought the Duty and I was impressed Let me just say off the bat that as many know the first many months of the game s existence the online play would become unplayable when a certain amount of people clogged a server Sometime back now however the guys FINALLY released a patch and the game now works as well as it possibly could Now this is why the game refuses to let me abandon it The graphics are very good and perhaps more importantly the framerate is excellent A reoccuring problem among past console shooters Halo and Halo 2 prayed it could touch 60 frames per second like CoD2 that had yet to be overcome we now finally have a game that runs silky smooth 95 of the time practically unaffected by the number of players on the screen or the viewing distance on larger levels It s gloriously smooth and I am completely obsessive about this sort of thing Add to this the graphical prowess which too is stunning despite an overall but in my opinion inconsequential semi lack of detail in textures and you ve got a gaming universe that is good to go for even the most demanding lowlife The control with great help from the consistent framerate is good Once you ve gotten used to it it radiates Best I ve used on a console beating out even the Halo s which I dabbed in for a bit via friends due again to the huge improvement in the rendering speed of the graphics It becomes intuitive but with the constant ability to probe deeper into skill level I personally play on the high sensitivity setting and while I m still not as good as I would be with a mouse theorhetically I am good far better than I could have ever imagined with a controller Net code is delicious Even with pings of up to 2 300 KIND of stretching it you have very little disadvantage over even the host Because of the way it works you aren t shooting and having it shoot 2 seconds later However it does it it does but it compensates for the latency and there is practically no unfair play as a result This whole point is of immense value because along with the awesome graphics and speed the netcode offers essentially no determent of any kind Overall this all adds up to a near perfect online gaming experience that is as good as any I ve played on PC just stunning Oh yeah and Xbox Live s interface with the whole friend s dealie Brilliant Get with friends in seconds at any point in time The microphone of course adds to the greatness of an already great experience The game It s fun as anything The weapons are awesome Sound effects blast and make for totally satisfying kills Everything is well balanced despite the fact that lesser skilled players will say snipers outweigh all other weapons Maps overall are wonderfully designed and dynamic Personally I m still into the standard modes of play there are five deathmatch and team deathmatch and they are a riot It all works beautifully It s FUN so fun and consequently can become like a powerful drug Hmmm So yeah five stars without any hesitation whatsoever based simply on multiplayer It is the one game that has never for a second made me regret the purchase of a 360 
Works fine on XP This is an enjoyable game educational as well For the price it s worth buying The puzzles aren t difficult but challenging enough to keep it interesting The game reminded me of an easier version of Myst You don t need to have prior knowledge of physics a handy reference guide is available as part of the gameplay The only drawback was that the screen was small Maybe that could have been fixed but I didn t want to mess with the setup since some games can be finicky on XP 
physicus it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there Some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve Other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline 
Good game I like it I think this is a great game and my wife and I are currently addicted to it It s definitely more to the SimCity style of play than the Civilization series though it allows more granular control of your city than SimCity The only Civilization aspect is the research which is enjoyable But other than that there isn t much Civ to CivCity which isn t necessarily bad This game reminds me heavily of a german title Knights and Merchants 1998 but with much better implementation On that note if you find that this game isn t for you try the VERY similar but much easier Glory of the Roman Empire This game is definitely challenging but in a good way Someone complained about small maps the maps get bigger as your progress through the game and the small maps are small for a reason it adds challenge to the game for example there is an island map with limited resources which requires that you build a shipping fleet The interface is generally good but there are some non intuitive things like sending tributes I think the graphics are nice especially the temples but it s definitely not the end all as far as graphics go There are a lot of city beautification enhancements fountains gardens etc that I don t tend to mess with but they are pretty and increase your city s happiness Your citizens will candidly tell you if they think your city is a dump I think they did an excellent job on the citizen interaction amusing yet useful Regarding the game breaking click select bug I m playing at 1024x768 resolution and I barely have any problems with it When I do I simply rotate my map and I m able to select what I want I don t consider the bug to be game breaking or even all that annoying though I m glad they re coming out with a patch to fix it All in all I think the game play is excellent Like all modern games the implementation was rushed nothing that a patch won t fix though I suspect the game will age well and have a high replay value 
Flawed but fun I agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status That being said I spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game Well worth the cost and enjoyable I am not familiar with the other Civ games and was looking more for a city building game set in the past similar to my favorite game Children of the Nile perhaps that explains why I was not disappointed 
Final Fantasy IX Review I am a big fan of RPGs and this is one of my favorite one yet It has a great story line and it is not impossible to beat 
Final Fantasy IX This game is a great one I enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or a good RPG 
sleeping giant This is perhaps the best of the Final Fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated IX had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay The characters are some of the most delightful in the series Personally I think Vivi and Zidane are the coolest characters ever Lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline On a sidenote This game definitely deserves a remake There s a lot of hype about final fantasy VII its own prequel and a remake coming for PS3 I feel that Final Fantasy IX should be remade on the PS3 I love the story line better than VII the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible 
Amazing I just got this game on thursday and I m already on disc 2 This is my first time ever playing a Final Fantasy game and I m glad I picked number 9 I won t spoil anything by telling any of the story but I will tell you the game is amazing The graphics are great and there the best I ve ever seen for a PS1 game I love characters I d have to say that Vivi is my favorite and then next would be Zidane but really I love them all Playing Final Fantasy 9 has made me wanna buy the other games and play them too Buy this game you won t regret it 
The FINAL Final Fantasy for the PSone This is probably one of my least favorite FF games on the PSone There are some good things and some bad things about this game first the bad 1 Squaresoft Now Square Enix Goddammit was trying to get to the old roots of the SNES games To me anyway it doesn t look entirely like those games 2 Some of the characters are the worst in the FF games history Quina Eiko and Garnet I am not sexist it s just that their abilities suck and their type of combat is terrible the other characters are good not great but decent 3 I don t care too much for the character models the deformation and Final Fantasy 8 graphics mix okay for the good parts of the game 1 The Cinemas they look really good for a PSone game most of the games cinemas on the PSone don t look that great in this era of gaming and even some during that era 2 Ending I am not saying anymore 3 The battle system it s not quite FF8 and not quite FF7 but it s in between and has the Trance system thingy After this game I sadly am seeing the series not being as good as it once was I like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals and can t wait for the remake of FF3 for the DS Final Fantasy 10 isn t that legendary FF 11 which I never did and never will play because of fees reminds me too much like Phantasy Star Online I like that game though and not much of a single player expericence with no storyline and FF 12 just because it will have the FF11 battle engine looks like FFCC and FF10 mixed together and I just seem not to care that much about the newer FF games anymore So I would recommend any FF game on the PSone Including the PSone ports of the SNES games and Origins because they are so great and even if the games don t have the best graphics in the world it s gameplay and storylines that count 
The best game ever It has buttons and no cord I can press the buttons with my thumbs The sticks go round and round and round and round 
Great Controller This controller feels great in your hands In fact after using this controller for awhile my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands The response of the controller is good I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time One down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year 
Seven Months I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them The problem is the same every time the left analog stick breaks My girlfriend got me my first one in December 2004 Christmas It lasted until about July 2005 I exchanged it at the store and the new one lasted until maybe February 2006 I exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in September 2006 I am not really a heavy gamer I play Madden and NCAA 2007 sparingly I am very disappointed with this repeat problem I also notice the X button sticking issue that others refer to here I tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick That seemed to work for a while You really can t beat the convenience of wireless and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability 
Gothic 2 Gold Very good overall graphic voices good sometimes funny sometimes sarcastic PC Game should have a Readme file that gives maps and walkthroughs 
Best RPG yet Gothic 2 is the only RPG I have ever replayed with the Add on included in this Gold version enhancing and expanding the original game fantastically I live in the UK where this version has still not been released why so to get a copy I had to order it to be sent to a friend in the States who kindly posted it on to me Gothic 2 has a living world where things happen around you and people get on with their lives go to work then the pub maybe cook some food and then home to bed for example as do the animals with prey getting chased by predators Quests are interesting and much more than just take this package to so and so With some faction quests you even get to see and play the other side if you replay the game and say join the guards instead of the merceneries The Add on has some brilliant new areas quests and creatures with the whole thing being wonderfully integrated into the original game The Gothic games are the only games where I have gone and practised my swordplay in the fields as fighting is more than button bashing Fighting is actually fun in these games not something I can say about any others although I have high hopes for Oblivion British gaming magazines have criticised Gothic 2 for you not being able to choose your appearance Who cares when you look believable and your armour and weapons can change Anyway playing in first person is more immersive than third person and then it doesn t really matter what you look like the voices not being very good OK you get to recognize some of the actors voices playing different parts and the final things I don t want to give any kind of spoiler away voices are a bit pants especially for what they are but it doesn t matter because the rest of the game is so good not having enough stats skills to raise and personalise your character OK so there s not a vast range of skills and stats but enough to make you have to choose where to spend your points and to have to specialise so what more do you want Having 50 different skills to choose between instead of 15 say does not make a better game Ultimately if you like RPGs you should buy this game and have many hours of pure fun Maybe you too will decide it s too scary to go out at night and instead find a nice bed you can sleep the night away in or a bench to sit on and admire the view whilst waiting for dawn and some light to see what s coming next 
Simple the best This game run at my computer very well The scenarios and story are very god The price are very chepest and the delivery very speedy 
Totally Different I came upon this game as a demo from SONY I downloaded it onto my PSP and was hooked within 5 minutes I needed to have the full game Don t let the child like voices and images steer you clear of this game if you are an older gamer Trust me you will have some fun The only thing is I did beat it a little too fast Still very fun 
Fun for Seniors I purchased a Nintendo DS specifically for this game and was not disappointed I m 65 and on a good day can get my brain age into the 30s I gave the game and a DS to an 80 year old friend and she can get into the 40s We both struggle with the test that calls for memorizing from a list of words After learning to play Sudoku in Brain Age I switched to playing it on my Palm Pilot game from Astraware which lets me enter the game from the daily newspaper I ve recently lent my DS to a 6th grader who is learning Sudoku By the way avoid the DS game called Sudoku It s unnecessarily clunky for entering data This is an appropriate game for seniors who like math logic challenges even if they ve never used a computer Plan to spend some time tutoring a newbie and then watch as he or she enjoys the challenge 
Brain Training I love this game I love the training exercises being able to compare them with other who creat files on my game and I especially love the Sudokus I feel smarter already 
Fun for the roadtrip Since the heady days of arcade favorites such as Asteroids Pac Man and Missile Command people have claimed that video games can help sharpen your reflexes and keep you thinking fast But there never seemed to be any hard science to back it up Over 20 years later Nintendo s releasing a product for the Nintendo DS that is squarely aimed at that hard science making the claim that playing Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day can make your brain feel fresh and sharp Well we re not scientists so we can t necessarily prove or disprove that claim but as a budget priced game Brain Age is strangely compelling even though its very nature is brutally repetitive The touch screen and DS microphone make the whole game possible It s a really slick way to play the game but it s also reliant on your handwriting and ability to speak clearly When you re rushing through math problems it s easy to squiggle down something that the game will misinterpret This is extremely frustrating as you re penalized for mistakes The voice recognition doesn t come into play very often and you can bypass it entirely if you like but we had trouble getting it to recognize certain words Over time you figure out exactly how the game wants you to write and speak and then adapt to it For the most part though the recognition is pretty impressive especially considering there s no calibration process involved OVERALL This game isnt really one of those games you look foward to do when you get home from whatever you do it s one of those games you can look foward to bring to do something thats why it s a usfull game made on a portabal system Great game for the roadtrip 
The Brain Workout Thinking Analyzing Solving Problems Reading Logic These are just some of the skills that Brain Age will help you develop or re develop No it s not Resident Evil or Splinter Cell But it is as fun and addictive it s certainly as challenging if not more challenging and it s a nice pallet cleanser from the plethora of pure entertainment value games that my kids and I play Brain Age is a bit advanced at times for my grade schoolers but the parts that they do get really help them develop the skills that they are concurrently working on in school Big Brain Academy is a much easier not better alternative for younger children There s a daily training area that gives your skills a workout And there s a test area that challenges you to quickly and accurately work through various tasks then provides you with a calculation of your Brain Age based on how well you did on the test Sudoku has it s own area to train the brain on number logic Kids reading this will NO vote me to death for saying this but this is a great game for parents to get for their kids It s one of the only ones Big Brain Academy is the other that I never take away from my own kids when they ve misbehaved or simply just had too much video gaming They never complain One word of advice Brain Age has a hard time recognizing an 8 if you write it the way you d skate a figure 8 it likes it better when you draw an 8 as two circles on top of each other Addictive fun Buy it 
Innovative This is latest DS game I have purchased and somehow it happens to be educational AND fun It gives you fifteen different training tasks and sudoku to boost your Brain Age 20 years being best and 80 worst They re all preaty neat in that they all use the touch screen or MIC The only problem is that sometimes the writing and voice recognition of numbers and words isn t so great Besides that the games like the math facts and sudoku are VERY addictive So I recommend this for the cheap price 15 and addictiveness which is well worth it 
Great gaming experience I am glad to see some favorable reviews below I thought I was the only one that thought this game rocked I was pretty shocked to read the very mediocre reviews form the experts like gamespot which gave this game a 5 5 Most of the experts seem to base their opinions mostly on the control scheme I admit at first it was a bit unwieldy because instead of using a control pad or joystick to aim the gun reticle you use the remote to point As such it did seem a bit too sensitive but once you play for a while you get very used to it At least I did it felt almost second nature to me The sword fighting is a bit janky but still good your motions doesn t necessarily translate to what happens on the screen I thought the whole storyline and scenarios were very clever one stage even had you trying to escape from an amusement park while being hunted The graphics I thought were very good In some of the harbor scenes the shimmering waves were amazing and the little attention to details such as the scratches on the elevator doors was a nice touch I do admit to being a bit disappointed that the graphics in this game aren t like the ones you see on the official trailers for Red Steel But the way some of the reviewers are talking about the graphics you d think they were reviewing a playstation one game One can only get excited to know that the graphics can get even better The bottom line is that out of the five launch games I got Red Steel is the one that I keep coming back to the most because to me it is FUN I don t care what the reviewers think that s the way I feel 
A Very Well Crafted Game Red Steel lives up to all of the hype if you give it the chance to When I first played the game the controls were difficult and awkward This was due to most of the actions being carried out by movements of the controllers rather than by pressing buttons After I got the hang of it the game excelled It s the best control scheme possible for a console first person shooter very much akin to using a keyboard and mouse If you re a bad shot in the game it s because you re a bad shot with real time aiming not because you can t point a finicky joystick in the right direction The sword combat is amazing mapping your actual movements much closer than Zelda Again it takes some getting used to but this is due to the fact that Red Steel is breaking entirely new ground in terms of how to play a game of this type The voice acting is superb The characters who have lived in America have a very realistic American accent The Japanese security guards have a very thick accent which is appropriate due to spending most of their lives in Japan and only traveling to America at the start of the game Sato who is a very wealthy Japanese man with business connections in America appropriately has a much more understandable English but the Japanese influence is still clear in his speech patterns The sound effects are amazing especially considering how interactive the levels are The sounds effects piped through the Wiimote are very realistic when compared to the sound effects from Zelda The graphics are nothing to write home about if you compare them to the hi def Xbox 360 and PS3 However if you let them stand as they are and play the game you ll soon be sucked in There is really very little to complain about unless you insist on emphasizing that it s not on the bleeding edge of technology All in all the game is very well made and enjoyable if you are a fan of first person shooters 
Loads of Fun I am having a great time playing this game I play it almost all day I like the fact you get to choose your own people to play I get to arrange the different people to my best estimate of a challenging game 
Great Game Just thought I d share my my opinion I think ID2 is a great game with a very deep lore great graphics replayability and more If your into RPG games this is right up your alley 
Lots of fun not a bad story either Anyone who s a fan of the Black Isle games based on the infinity engine should enjoy this game They changed up the character creation a little so you seemingly have more control over your character s strengths and weaknesses While IWDII doesn t have the depth of Torment or the NPC interaction of the Baldur s Gate series it still has a good story and a nice interface Graphically it s subpar to the NWN series but I think that might actually be a benefit as I found the 3D aspect of NWN to be a hinderence at times Some tips for those interested 1 Make a party of 4 characters They will level up faster and have less hang ups with the AI With 6 members I found I needed to start over and import them into a new game after the prologue because they were under powered and 2 of them always end up wandering off on me Those problems are abated with only 4 characters 2 Multiclassing is key Having thief abilities is nice but you don t really need more than 3 or 4 levels as rogue Sink all the points into picking locks and traps Multiclass into a ranger or mage You won t have to worry about armor hindering thief skills Adding a few levels of fighter to cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills and in the case of a cleric a boost to HP These are just a few ideas 3 For the warriors focus on only a couple differnt weapons Make sure you have at least one of them blunt weapons as some foes aren t as vulnerable to the bladed variety Also have at least 2 members competent with ranged weapons 
icewind dale 2 review very good game a classic dungeon crawl that captures essence of dnd game on compute 
Standard Fare If you like these games you ll love this one if you don t you won t 
final fantasy rpg finally to be honest I lost confident on squresoft after playing ffVIII and they pick up a little on ffIX then they mess the rpg formula on ffX ffXI and ffX 2 wherever they called those rpg games now they star fresh on ffXII very good game I just remenber when I played my first rpg s game ffII then ffIII on the snes not mention the clasic like chrono trigger secre of mana ff tactic s ffvII ogre tactic s for mhont s this game has the rpg root s and the music a clasic from ffII and some from fftactic s the graphi s are fantastic the new engine is a little pro and con since they are place s where you need to turn off the gamblic icom to finish a sequense and continous with the game very cleaver but good hope now on squre enix keep up the good work on keeping the francise fresh as this one exellent game recommended to any harcore rpg player 10 out 10 
Reminds me of Final Fantasy XI online Wow this game is a blend of Final Fantasy XI + Vagrant Story Some of the armor and creatures are from FFXI This is the perfect game for me since I miss the graphics and gameplay of FFXI online but I dont have 300+ hours of my life to sink into it so FFXII is the perfect alternative for Ex FFXI online players who have a life The battle system and graphics are amazing The skill development is a more complex than usual FF games so a young teenager might not be able to build their characters to their full potentials The only bad thing i can see with this game is the new Moogles design they look like rabbits now Who s idea was it to dump the pudgy fat hamster design 
A pretty good game I ve been playing Final Fantasy games since the beginning Having to buy spells weapons and everything reminds me of many of the early games which is good in my opinion Of course it s odd to have to also pay License Points for them It s not really a bad system there though The voice acting though not the worst is still not that great Then again I prefer the Japanese language tracks The way I see it they can subtitle these games and if someone is too lazy to read they shouldn t be playing an RPG to begin with since that has always been a big part of any RPG Now for the worst part about this game The camera Sometimes it seems to jump anywhere except for where it would be useful in smaller areas Plus when you try to pan left the camera pans right and when you try to pan right the camera pans left I talked to someone who played FFXI and they say it s similar except that the camera pans the way you press I think it was meant to be like that but someone miscoded and rather than take the time to fix it they decided to just release the game The plot though I have not gone far in the game yet seems to be a rather decent plot though still rathr generic Of course it s diffcult to create a nongeneric plot these days since most plots have already been used Favorite RPG Chrono Trigger Favorite Final Fantasy Final Fantasy IX Least Favorite Final Fantasy Final Fantasy VIII Least Favorite RPG Sailor Moon RPG 
Finally Fantasy Fun Ok I did not review any of the other comments on this game before posting this I have been playing Final Fantasy games for a very long time I still have and play p Mystic Quest Final Fantasy II and FF III for SNES FF XII is the BEST Final Fantasy since 3 US in my opinion and it is FUN The story line is AWESOME kinda like Shakespeare meets King Arthur and it reminds me a bit of final fantasy 3 only with awesome graphics My one peeve for all of the games was leveling up HP and MP I felt like after I mastered the new way of doing it they changed it for the next game The old games did it automatically after those you had to equip things in order to gain strength magic and special abilities This game combines what you have already learned from FF VII on and if you have never played the game there is a great tutorial that you can access at any time This game is just plain FUN I think the MOST fun since FF III You have the freedom to explore and wander without getting lost there is a reminder at the bottom of the map and X s to show you where to go you can see whatever you come into contcact with friends and foes and the storyline and gameplay are phenomenal 
THE BEST GAMEPLAY IS FINAL FANTASY SERIES I finished almost all final fantasy games FF1 10 10 2 FF Tactics I would say that this FF XII is the best gameplay in final fantasy I ever dream off since my childhood I will summarize as follows 1 Game play I would rate this 10 stars but here the max is just 5 The game looks boring at first but once you get a party and the A I system called Gambit in the game this is extremely fun The battle environment is superb Looks much like real battle No battle scene No random battle Everything appears on the map Multiple attacks can land on the enemy at the same time The camera view is half global you can see everything if there is no obstacle from front behing left right and above not below though since the floor is an obstacle THIS IS LIKE THE REAL THING THE THING I WANT TO SEE IN FINAL FANTASY 2 Graphic superb The rendered texture looks inferior to FF X and FF X 2 when these two have the highest quality of the cutscene displayed But the over all cut scene is better since in FF X and X 2 there are sometimes that the cutscene looks really bad I am more satisfied to something that is smoothly good on average not too good cutscene and then extremely bad at times 3 Music Superb Thus far no normal battle music but that does not matter The music is not so great when you listen separately but it suits the game environment a lot 4 Trivia the town is so huge Look like the real town Approximately more than 50 100 people you can talk with in each town The costume looks so different It is not just like the old series of this game where the town person in town A may looks exactly alike that in another town if you notice But in FF XII you have to notice meticulously to see that similarity Overall everyone looks unique Another thing I would say that the environment looks much like STAR WARS + LORD OF THE RINGS though I put more emphasis on the former If you watch STAR WARS Episode I you will see why I think it looks much like STAR WARS Cons I would say that these cons is nothing compared to the pros 1 Storyline Quite simple No plot twist thus fat I have played Not many things stimulate the players to want to know what will happen next Unlike FFX that game introduced many interesting plots from the beginning and gradually unraveled them as the game proceeded I would say that if you were to watch only the movies and the cutscene FFXII sounds like a normal battle story in the middle age But why there are so many hi tech transportation 2 Voice I would say that the voice actors in this game is quite disappointing They did the good job I admitted but their voices doesn t seem to sound good For example compared to FF X the main female protagonist has the unique voice but that in FF XII sounds like typical american people The second main female protagonist in FF X sounds unique but that in FFXII sounds ok not so great The main antagonist in FF X sounds mysteriously great but that in FFXII sounds quite dull The only one that I think he sounds ok is the main male protagonist 
Great I will try to keep this brief by the way I m only 10 hrs thru only just got out of City 1 Rabernastre Dalmasca and now in city 2 Bahjerba sp Quickly my first impressions of the game were strange I was like MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing but after maybe 20 min of getting of the wierdness it really sucks you in Ughh I really wish I didn t have midterms coming up so I could go home and play Pros Love the battle system It s still strategy but it doesn t require you to have random battles ughh I d hate the whzzzhhh of the starting of random battles I can still feel in control but doing less actual work Like everyone else says CG always good Story though not as much character development focus as previous ones I do like the whole war polity centered plot It does follow FFT s tradition I actually like the license board some people have said it s a pain in the beginning but so far it hasn t been the case for me granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit 40 min or so You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to don t randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING Plan plan plan Right now by the way I m constructing my chars in the way the game hints at its only one way to do it but first time around I ll follow it the already licensed equipment abilities hint at what they ll be good at HUGE game Lots of stuff to see and quite beautiful Character design course there is always someone to love Har har har as a fangirl I must say I love Basch D lol tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced He looks like a kid haha I m a college student and such a fangirl haha sad isn t it If I were a guy I d say I d like Fran the most this is of course subject to personal opinion I like subs and I like how they are not bland they have fancy font this time D Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor Makes the game really movie ish Widescreen capability Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not I also like that Free moving camera Thank heaven for that I LOVE it I hated the still camera immensely in FFX Cute monsters lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them Cons HUGE game yes also a con lots of time running around Good thing all the characters don t run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX Meh neutral Voices I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF s voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones The prev FF s voice actors were okay but not great Here the voice actors are really good but the choice of some of them seems strange like I have a problem with Fran s voice it was a strange choice and a strange voice Also Balthier s voice doesn t seem to go with his look but I really do like the voice acting by itself In sum some voices though really well acted didn t seem to fit the actor s look however I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well matched roles so I give the voice acting a mild thumbs up After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations I feel I must also address that As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard Marquis pronounced both as Markus and Marquis rather than Markee I also did twitch when they pronounced fete as feet rather than feh t Soundtrack I liked all the music there was a lot taken from FFT esp the battle music in the Estersand I think it is totally taken from FFT obviously as both take place in the same world I did enjoy the non midi renditions of the themes but the rest of the new guy s music was just meh wasn t particularly bad but it didn t really stand out much either 
The Godfather name alone could make this sell Simple Movie tie ins are usually a rather tiresome affair They sell bundles of units and are more often than not a large pile of mediocrity The Godfather game is different Obviously it s been made on the back of the unparalleled success of Francis Ford Coppolla s gangster masterpiece And it will sell for this reason as well However The Godfather game has it s own place in the epic narrative It would have been easy for EA to put the player in the shoes of Michael Corleone the main protagonist in the movies Indeed it may have been due to the failure in securing a license to use Al Pacino s voice and likeness that forced EA s hand in creating a fresh perspective on the famous storyline What we re left with is a new take featuring your good self a narrative that sees you seamlessly weave in and out of events loyal to the film For example when Luca Brasi is stabbed through the hand and garrotted at the start of the first movie you look in on the event through a window you re spotted and the scene turns into a revenge mission It s expertly executed as you feel a part of a story that is genuine and loyal to film The violence has been superbly recreated also The realistic nature of the firearms in The Godfather makes for interesting gameplay As you might be used to the rather cartoonish gunplay of Saint s Row and GTA The Godfather might at first seem unforgiving And it is But it s realistic take one bullet from close range and you re sleeping with the fishes it s as simple as that Conversely your own guns carry the same clout so shootouts often become intense and challenging affairs if a little frustrating Where as in GTA s gun fighting success is dependent on how quickly you can change targets and get your shots off The Godfather sees you picking your shots and timing runs between cover It s obvious that EA s development focussed heavily on the walking and shooting parts of the game as this is where most of the appeal lies Driving however is a different affair altogether Given the nature of The Godfather EA were limited on what is and isn t possible for the driving sections The physics of the cars mean they are frustrating to play with Most of the vehicles are slow and the faster cars seem unnaturally quick The handbrake turns that work so well in GTA are irritatingly difficult to pull off especially when being chased by the coppers Cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected Other vehicles however are seemingly made of concrete Also getting from one way point to another can be at times be tedious GTA gets round this by the superbly scripted radio stations but The Godfather doesn t have such ingenuity you re instead treated to a violin based soundtrack that is depressing once the novelty has done a runner The valid excuse is that most of this isn t EA s fault this is more or less what it was like to drive a car in them days There was no radio the cars were lame classic but moved like pair of concrete boots Where the violence is so real so must the rest of the game be if only for consistency As you would expect much of what you do is directed by the storyline However there have been provisions for those who are more impulsive Outside of the missions there are businesses to extort and rackets to take over Doing as such will build your weekly wage which you can then in turn spend on clobber and sorting your hair out You have a respect bar that increases with each completed mission but coolly this isn t the only way to gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters Buying a nice wise guy suit brings in the plaudits and boosts the respect meter as much as whacking a guy Each time your character levels up you get a point to allocate to his attributes It s a bit of a weak RPG element but worth thinking about when acquiring garments Extorting businesses is tricky but worth the effort You ll usually have to take out two or three bad guys before being able to get to the owner When you do the situation requires thought Essentially you need to scare the businessman into paying and you do so by finding his or her limit So while some owners will agree to protection as soon as you ask others will have to be battered to the brink of death Pretty sick but then the life of a gangster isn t for fairies Be warned though going over the top or killing the proprietor will render the business inactive for a while and you ll get nothing but a bruised set of knuckles It s a fantastic sidetrack to the main game that has to be taken seriously if you want to hire muscle and buy more powerful weapons for later missions And so you ve got two sections of the same game that sit paradoxically to each other The superbly well balanced combat game play that forces you to be thoughtful and timely And the very dodgy vehicle part that frustrates and bores more than anything else It s difficult to review a sandbox game without making a comparison to GTA although it s slightly unfair to do so with The Godfather given the rules imposed by the subject matter At it s very best it delivers a gritty realism but by the same realistic token it can be at times terribly dull It is difficult to dislike The Godfather as EA have been so faithful to everything we loved about the films but this is the undoing of the game also It would have been forgivable to exaggerate the gameplay in places in order to make it more entertaining But The Godfather is a game for the purists and in order to please it has to feel genuine The Godfather certainly is 
Money Power and Respect The Godfather The Game allows you to live the Godfather movies The storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well The missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving But overall if your a fan of the Godfather like I am you wont care Respect the Family 
If you don t like this game you can sleep with the fishes This game is one of EA s best efforts outside of the sports genre in recent years It feels a little like Grand Theft Auto but also has the easy to use format that is common to EA games While it is violent there are no rewards for killing pedestrians and doing so creates a hassel for your character In true mob form you can bribe police officers but killing them isn t usually the best alternative The weapon system in this game is great You can start out by buying or picking up basic weapons at the beginning and can purchase more efficient and accurate weapons later in the game The old stand by s of shotguns tommyguns pistols dynamite and even bombs are all available for purchase If you are a into character development this is the sandbox game for you It allows you to gain experience respect that you can use to upgrade any of 10 different skills If you are a fan of the classic movie you probably won t be dissappointed either While the game takes place parallel to the action of the film it is fairly well done and even though Micheal looks nothing like Pachino the other major characters all show up James Cann plays Sonny with gusto and makes the cutscenes pretty entertaining The customization is great too for those tired of playing as one of the GTA characters that you are forced to be in those games You can change appearence clothing and body type among other things The gameplay is solid and the shooting system is far more rewarding than most third person shooters The game took me 25 hours to beat on the medium difficulty and another 10 to get all of the unlockables Trust me this is a great game with pretty good replay value 
March 6 2006 below has it all backwards The version 2 0 has been altered to remove the ability to hot coffee mod the program This version 2 0 while still containing the violence language and sexual references was altered to remove the ability to de clothe the characters within the game The original release could be altered The version 2 0 was released due to a small public outcry about the nudity AND a few activities that are going on while in the nude Strange when you can remember the reasons why they tried to ban Grand Theft Auto 3 all those years ago This time around they don t even mention violence They are mad now because kids can see people nekkid 
Nice game I like the GTA series of games and this one is great too I can turn up my settings to max My computer is over a year old and there are no problems The kid reviewer claims that he doesn t like the N F bomb That is why this is rated M for Mature so he should not even be playing it To give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated This is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions 
Fun Game INTRO I know that some people if I may quote the other reveiwer Mr B think this game is not easy for normal humans but seriously it is a good game Don t base it on whether a level or two is challenging Would you like it better if it was a piece of cake I sure as heck wouldn t To be fair I did have some trouble with levels Rift River some parts of the Planetarium etc GAMEPLAY Tak 2 plays very nicely as far as games go Environments and animals and people are so nicely done and the levels are varied not like you re in one area for the whole game The music is easily listenable to not like some other obnoxious video game music example being Kingdom Hearts Traverse Town music Forigve me The fighting system is basically button mashing at the beginning but it develops as you get new juju powers and learn combo attacks I also enjoyed the animal changing parts of the game true some parts were unbeliveably annoying like when you re a flying squirrel juju runs out and you plummet to your death kind annoying but I still liked the idea of being able to change into bears squirrels frogs and boars This game s graphics do the animators credit It s awesome how Tak s moves look so realistic when he s in water or in mud or tipetoeing or jumping or whatever PROS AND CONS Pros 1 Amazing animation 2 Funny dialouge 3 For once a game with good music 4 Nice fighting system 5 Awsome animal changes 6 Just darn fun to play and beat Cons 1 Some really hard killer levels I had a ton of trouble with the darts in Gloomleaf Swamp bleh 2 A few glitches and bugs in this game 3 Augh Loading times OVERALL I d definitely say buy it if not rent it It s really fun and has a ton of replay value 
Square should be ashamed when I heard that Square was putting out a game and Disney was fronting it I was on even keel I don t have much love for disney but that rings true for mario as well and I still played Mario RPG However unlike Mario RPG from here on just Mario Final Fantasy FF characters weren t featured I m all for a little cosmetic upgrade on Squall and Cloud since the graphics of when the their games were made and now have quite a gap One thing I didn t expect is that some of the most powerful and beloved characters in video game history would take back seat to a kid with a key for a weapon These two protagnosits in particular had much more emotional development and struggle then Sora ever will This is beyond frusterating After all Cloud has been through he is still seen as this weak willed person with no direction or purpose in life Squall on the other hand unlike Cloud s psychological battle had huge distancing and emotional issues to overcome especially abandonment But in FF8 he showed that final boss and Greiver what for To know that I put so much time in 2 games that gave me a reason to truly care about all 8 members in either given game I couldn t care less about Sora and his friends or the fate of every Disney world Lame Square Lame You have some of the most highest grossing games in both RPG and over all in history and you still sold out for DISNEY I had come to expect more from a company that caused me to stay up so many nights miss so much homework and miss out on so many life experiences Thank GOD you didn t disgrace some of your more advanced titles Xenogears and Vagrant Story come to mind Well thats my review and any true square fan can take it or leave it but while you play your game just remember who your dishonoring 
This game just plain rocks This game is just so intresting game to play Loving the disney characters and a fanatic for the final fantasy series especially FF7 Seeing Cloud in this game was SOOOOOOO Cool Playing as Sora You travel through the worlds of Disney Characters Sure the fighting may have gotten a little annoying but you quickly forget about it once you are on your way to the new world you are about go to Overall the graphics were SWEET storyline even better and the voices along with the intresting atmosphere really made this a great game that should be all gaming collections Highly recommended 
good game it is very confusing and I had to find some hints for playing the game too much going back and forth hunting for things and if you miss something you sometimes can t go back to get it Overall I like it because it is not overly difficult so far I hate games that are so difficult that only experienced gamers can play 
One of the best games i ve ever played Life seems perfect for young boy Sora voiced by Haley Joel Osmont with his buddies Kairi and Riku on his island but when a freak storm mysteriously takes them away things go out of hand The same weird thing has happened in the imaginary disney kingdom where King Mickey Mouse has mysteriously vanished without a trace with only Donald and Goofy on a mission to find him Along the way they meet Sora and team up with him to travel to different worlds based on each disney movie like Aladdin Little Mermaid Hercules Tarzan Beauty and The Beast The Nightmare Before Christmas and more as they battle the evil heartless and such bad guys like Ursula Jafar Hades and more One of the most ingenius and unique video games i ve ever played successfully combines disney with Final Fantasy to create one incredible game that will blow your mind Fans of both Disney and FF will rejoice as this game puts together both things the graphics are spectacular especially the music score The controlling is good once you get use to it and you ll hear the voices of Billy Zane James Woods Tony Goldwyn Sean Astin Jodie Benson Robbie Benson Chris Surandon and Gilbert Godfried here this is one hell of a game you must have if you love RPG and disney with FF alike Get it today including it s even better sequel 
Good game does it only work for PS1 When this game first came out i bought it I was very into the game Back then thats when there was just a ps1 But i never finished the game My original game was all scratched up so i bought a new one Now having just a ps2 I got the game but my ps2 seems not to read the disc I dont know why Does it only work for people who still have their ps1 I thought ps2 s were suppose to read ps1 games as well The thing is also My brother bought the game too and it still didnt read it in my ps2 So any help would be appreciated cause i want to play this again Thanks 
good game when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com 
Simply amazing A masterpiece and an instant RPG classic RPG fans won t want to miss this masterful follow up to the legendary Chrono Trigger on Super NES Chrono Cross has turned out to be one of those rare gems that manage that have all the qualities needed in order to make a truly memorable role playing game experience It does just about everything really well and does many things better than the original ever been did before If you re a fan of RPGs there s no doubt that you ll be pleased with this game and owe it to yourself to go out and buy it at your earliest convenience First and foremost the storyline in Chrono Cross is probably the most ambitious that any has ever been carried out in a console RPG with the possible exception of Xenogears The writing quality of Chrono Cross is exceptional and is nearly as good as the brilliant job that was done by the team responsible for Vagrant Story What makes all of this even more impressive is that Square was able to give each of the game s 40 plus playable characters different characteristics and in many cases distinct accents and speech patterns The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game That combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals Without spoiling anything the plot is very elaborate and deals with many issues such as humanity s role in the destruction of the environment and how fate plays a role in our lives Plus it brings forth the idea of parallel worlds and how the outcome of one s life can be greatly effected by what happens during certain significant events in one s life All of this has been pulled together nicely and the end result is one of the most intricate plots that one will ever encounter in a videogame Not to be too cliched but Chrono Cross is a truly epic role playing game experience that has cemented its place in the annals of RPG history It s easily one of the best RPGs currently available on PlayStation and has surpassed Vagrant Story as my personal favorite If you re a fan of role playing games then you must go out and buy a copy of Chrono Cross 
addicting Had this game on our gamecube so addicting then now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff You have to get a certain rating I believe like A D nonetheless it is a great game worth the money If you have kids the kids will thoroughly enjoy 
The best Mario Kart up to date If you are a DS owner this game is a must have You will not be disappointed 
Possibly the best kart game ever It was inevitable that mario kart would finally make its way onto the DS The question that was on everybody s mind was is it going to be fun We can answer that question with an unequivocal YES AND A BAG OF CHIPS While it is not as pretty and intuitive as its big brother Mario Kart Double Dash on the GC it makes up for that tiny flaw with moxie and great design There are great new weapons at your disposal as well as more than a few familiar ones The single greatest weapon addition would have to be the ink bullet that temporarily blinds the driving screen forcing the gamer to navigate using the map on the upper screen And of course the new game brings in a new design feature that allows you to speed up if you tailgate your opponent for long enough allowing you zip past the competition But the single greatest design aspect of Mario Kart DS that makes it a contender for greatest kart game ever is summarized by two simple words Wireless Gameplay Now you can battle people as far as the other side of the world provided that you have useable WiFi in your area and if you don t you can easily remedy this by buying the Nintendo Wireless dongle that attaches to your USB port on your PC for blissful online gameplay I have had my buttocks handed to me on numerous occasions by players from Japan Mali and even in the good ole US of A as well as narrowly squeeking by with undeserved victories Player skills range from relatively new to god like mostly the japanese players so you might want to brush up on your skills before entering the online arena but rest assured that once you get into it you ll fall hard So to summarize Mario Kart DS good so you should buy Seriously Click on the buy now button right now You won t regret it 
mario kart ds my daughter age 8 love the game after school and when we go out in the car she is playing it 
A home run by Nintendo This game is another must own if you have a DS It has a total of eight cups with four races each 16 all new 16 retro Go through different difficulties to unlock new racers and Karts and mirror mode where you do the game backwards Also the first with WIFI gaming playing online is awesome In short BUY THIS GAME 
Great Game Lots of fun What a fun game The graphics are good The stereo sound is awesome There are plenty of tracks and it s got multi player We ve had a blast with this one High quality fun from Nintendo 
Good for the kiddies I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases is that right ago and i gotta say it was alright the pros are that it is up to four players so if dad wants to spend quality time with junior it has a wide variety of fun characters and plenty of levels HOWEVER it lacks graphics and young children might not do well during the game but overall its alright Graphics C It must have been released early cuz it s pretty bad Sound B+ crisp sounds the sound really matches the mood Controls A Changing and controlling characters a breeze Good for children and adults to 
Be Patient but kids can do it too My just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he can t do a VERY few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy I had to finally defeat for him BUT he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters It has a tad more killing of stuff than I care for but what doesn t these days He likes being able to be different characters his favorite is Puss n Boots As a grown up I enjoyed it as well especially the humor 
Shrek is Back Pretty Fun Lots of action and all the characters are here Some parts would be difficult for younger players or for single players though 
Perfect fun for the younger set Shrek 2 was an amazingly funny movie with all of the wit and graphic animation of the first The game Shrek 2 is obviously geared towards kids but is great fun too The game lets you be one of four characters Shrek Fiona Donkey and the Gingerbread Man Each character has his or her strengths and weaknesses and the graphics are rather nicely done Shrek lands with a hard THUD Fiona floats gently to the ground and so on You can play multi player or solo easily switching between characters if you wish This is great for family play where parents can hop in to help out with a difficult puzzle or just wander along behind the child to be there in case of trouble Most of the game is about collecting items and solving simple puzzles You slam on snails to get them out of their shells and get eyeballs You slow down time so you can gather up the fairies All along there are fun jokes and riddles to keep you entertained Not all games have to be high brainpower puzzles or super fast lightning reflex challenges Sometimes it s nice to have a simple game that kids can really enjoy I m really pleased that this game is out there Highly recommended for the younger set and parents might actually enjoy playing along with the tykes 
A Fun Game But the graphics are pretty imbarasing The object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions levels and Hero Times a specific mission were you use one character Some of the levels are fun like the Far Far Away level it has a Grand Theft Auto Theme I give the graphics a 3 5 I think they should have done a better job on the main characters audio 4 5 gameplay 4 5 5 fun a 4 5 5 and an overall of 3 5 
fun but short The Incredibles movie was a pleasant suprise featuring lifelike characters well animated fight scenes and an interesting story The game follows closely to the movie with a few additional easter eggs First the good The Incredibles game has fun gameplay good overall graphics multiple cut scenes and a nice ammount of replayability The only problems with the game are that first the game is very short There aren t many levels and they aren t very long A good player can beat the entire game in less than a day but it will probably take a new player around a week Most of the length is caused by some hard sections such as the first two Omnidroid battles and places where the game makers didn t make it easy to grab a rope or something The game is heavily scripted making it easy to predict what you will have to face next The final problem is that you barely spend any time playing as Dash or Voilet Dash has two levels and Voilet only has one The game has a very fun bonus feature you can unlock about halfway through the game called Battle In battle you choose either Mr or Mrs Incredible and battle seemingly endless waves of enemies All in all The Incredibles is a short fun game that is worth a rental but you should think about it before you buy it Thanks for reading bubba samus 
Amazing Movie=Great Game The Incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being The Incredibles even though it is short Pros Amazing Characters Great Graphics Intresting Plot Footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artwork Cons Short Only 1 player Overall If you loved The Incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well The same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy 
Not To Bad Of A Game This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either Of course the movie is way better than the game The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again All in all it s a good game I would recommend it The graphics are good I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie It s not to bad of a game to play 
The Incredibles game is cooool I have the Incredibles Game Cube game and it is cool and FUN Even if you get stuck at a part it is fun trying to figure it out This game is challenging but it is still fun unlike some games where you get really mad if you can t figure out a part This game is great 
Finally Cooperative Mode in an Xbox 360 Title What can be better than a game made for adults or kids Sly sneaky humor that only adults will understand with the greatest toy ever created Legos All in the theme of the best of the Star Wars movies Many games put in replayability by allowing you to go through the game or missions a second or third time with a different character but Lego Star Wars does this in a fashion that is totally fun It s not a simple regurgitation of the map with a different character wihoo replayable but rather an ingenious method that rewards you with additional pieces for building as well as secret areas that were previously unobtainable For instance you might need a Stormtrooper or uniform a Jedi dark or light or even a Bounty Hunter to enter specific areas Droids are often used to access areas as well but you usually have them during the missions Using free play mode you can go back through the missions with a character you created or any other character you have unlocked During the mission you can cycle through your characters and use their abilities This allows you to go back and unlock new areas and find additional bricks etc The fact that there are new abilities with characters you find later as well as new areas to explore really makes the replayability fun and worthwhile Another aspect to this game that I absolutely love is cooperative play This is great for adults to be able to play along with the kids or even spouses My wife doesn t play a lot of Xbox titles but she loves playing this game and we have a blast going through the missions together I m surprised more games don t actually give you coop play like this Seems it s enough to toss in death match and label the game as multiplayer My only complaint is with the camera both in single and cooperative mode Often times the camera will shift based on one of the players and force the other player back towards the center of the screen On more than one occasion this has caused death to the characters or when we get stuck forces one of the players to swap characters midstream Sometimes this isn t obvious to the player It would have been really nice to have the option of split screen especially with the real estate an HDTV provides All in all I would highly recommend this game Especially if you have kids and want to spend some quality time with them Great game 
Great for kids all of us that never grew up The original Lego Star Wars was a great little lighthearted romp of a game an amusing way to play out the three most recent Star Wars films in virtual form The Lego and Star Wars combo proved to also be a terrific formula for the game space generating an experience in Lego Star Wars that was oftentimes even more entertaining than the source material it was based on Like any good sequel Lego Star Wars II improves on the original in almost every way But most importantly it s about the good episodes now For that reason alone Lego Star Wars II is one of the most enjoyable games of this fall Featuring the story lines and characters of A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi it s hard to believe that any Star Wars fan which is what pretty much everyone wouldn t love this game While the gameplay is pretty standard action fare for the most part it s somehow made so much more fun because of the Lego characters Levels that could perhaps be dismissed as lackluster in other games absolutely work here Star Wars scenes are comically recreated and look and sound great though to nitpick some of the John Williams music samples don t play in their entirety making you wish for more But make no mistake even those without a predilection for Star Wars will enjoy this it s the combination of great story lines characters and comedic elements provided by Lego that makes it all work The game s designers clearly had fun with it all you ll be continuously entertained by how they incorporated elements of the film into the gameplay often taking some rather humorous liberties along the way The Lego brand clearly afforded them freedom to have fun with the Star Wars license While most of the gameplay consists of run and gun action there are lots of puzzles to be found many of which are quite good even though some have rather unclear objectives and several missions that take place in vehicles from AT ST Walkers to X wings While the vehicular stages vary in terms of quality the mere fact that so many exist really adds to the scope of the game Lego Star Wars II offers a surprising amount of playtime and is much larger and longer than the original game which was one of its biggest criticisms Once again you control a group of characters that pertain to a scene allowing you to easily switch between them on the fly in order to take advantage of their unique abilities Unfortunately though your A I controlled buddies are kind of clueless at times and offer little support in battles while they do fire it s all for show their shots inflict no damage on enemies The game s far better when a second player joins in to play a game can be joined at any time it s loads of fun as a co op experience It s just a shame that Lego Star Wars II offers no online support What s also neat about the game is that there s a lot to do outside of the standard mission structure There are lots of collectables to gather secret items to discover and hidden areas to unlock certain areas aren t immediately accessible on the first playthrough only on return using other characters can they opened The option to build your own custom characters with parts taken from others such as a C 3PO equipped with a Darth Vadar head is amusing as well There s definitely a lot of fun to be had with Lego Star Wars II making it a good choice for those looking for a solid action platformer it s an ideal choice for those fans of Star Wars It s also perfect for almost all ages offering a rewarding experience even for younger players All of the many versions Xbox 360 PS2 PC Xbox GameCube and PSP look essentially the same with the PC version offering better resolutions and the Xbox 360 version more visual effects though it s unfortunately priced 10 more than the others Rumor has it that developers Traveller s Tales have more Lego games in the works after this including one based on Batman here s hoping as this formula simply works 
Great Gaming Fun for all ages I loved the original Lego Star Wars game It was incredibly fun very replayable and had a wicked sense of humor Lego Star Wars II is just as fun and covers Episodes IV VI It s very rare to find a game that kids can play adults can play and everybody truly loves it This is one of those games I m sure kids enjoy the game quite a lot but pretty much every adult gamer I know loves this series as well It s fun it has classic scenes from the Star Wars movies done in a VERY funny style and you can keep replaying it You can play it with friends You can unlock new episodes new ships new characters you name it The first thing you notice when you enter the Cantina is that now you can MAKE NEW CHARACTERS Yes you can mix up Darth Vader s head Princess Leia s torso and a stormtrooper s pants You can mix pretty much any character you find in the game and give them personalized names Then you can bring 2 of your creations into the game with you on free play mode Talk about fun The game gets even better Yes you work through all the classic scenes Luke buying the droids the Death Star blowing up and so on from the first 3 movies in release order at least The cut scenes are VERY funny Being able to play along as the various characters is amazingly fun in story mode and even better in free play when you can randomly switch between a variety of characters to find all the hidden items I love the stud finding system You want more money Just replay a mission a few times You can get all sorts of fun cheats not cheats really but fun add ons you can buy new characters to use and much more It really gives you incentive to keep playing Is a youngster in the house having trouble playing Just have an adult pop into the game for a while to help out then the adult can pop out again to let the child keep playing It is just brilliant I love this game The graphics are superb as last time with little lego movements seeming just right Their swaggers and sliders are incredibly funny The sound of course is the real movie soundtrack and is superb You couldn t ask for anything better Even the tiny touches are funny If C 3PO starts getting hit he loses an arm then another arm then a leg You have him hopping along valiantly behind you trying to remain with your team Chewie rips off arms from stormtroopers Now of course there are always a few things the game designers get wrong While Chewie s arm ripping is quite funny it is REALLY annoying when he does it very slowly in the middle of a firefight when you wanted him to be blasting away The characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone is nearby even if you really needed to fire away at someone with the blaster Even more annoying if you re blasting away at destructables wall items whatever and your friend gets near you start bashing on him The camera is also really annoying You get a slight amount of view control but not much When you are craning around trying to find a mini kit on the screen and the camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you do NOT want to look it can get very frustrating Still these are minor problems in a game that is so stellar I highly highly recommend this game for any gamer of any age It s incredibly fun 
Fun Game Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don t regret I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time Would not say it s one of the very bests available in its category but it s interesting and fun About graphics though the details are not great still I liked the 3 D view specially the view through the eyes of the main character Hero Story is so so Dialogs are specially bad But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea A sort of combination of RPG and RTS I like the units and the way they fight Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good Overall it s a nice game And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay 
Best game ever Loads of fun Great graphics Great RPG Great RTS I ve played it a few times and it s never boring Story is fantastic although linear A true proper trilogy I hope SpellForce 2 will be at least as good as this one I ve got it already but did not start it yet Cheers 
RPG meets RTS I ve never played real time strategy games before because I primarily play RPG s This game combines the best elements of both and I ve enjoyed playing it immensly I look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters 
A Phenominal Value Essentially this Platinum Edition DVD is three games for a bargain bin price I couldn t pass it up I had a little trouble getting it to launch at first but after a little Internet session I was back in the world of RPG RTS hybrid excellence The seamless integration of the two elements makes for a truly unique experience Unlike other RTS games there are many adventure elements and you aren t just plunked down on each map you have to fight your way from map to map Unlike other RPG games your hero won t be able to go it alone to defeat the foes that lay in their path he she will have to call upon the power of armies from six different races Human Elves Dwarves Orcs Trolls and Dark Elves Your avatar must find structures known as rune monuments to access his her unique power of using runes to summon forth rune heroes and armies The RPG element of the game is limited essentially to the character you create at the beginning Your avatar a rune warrior is a remnant of powerful heroes that served the Circle Mages during the time of The Convocation The avatar is completely under your control you choose the name equipment gender and distribute skill points and stat points as they gain levels to create a unique character You can create a punishing melee fighter a powerful sorcerer a deadeye archer or any combination of those and other concepts Your avatar can also summon rune heroes as he she goes along these heroes are other rune warriors whose levels and classes are fixed so all you can do is equip them with the best available items As you progress through the game you can find more powerful hero runes to summon better heroes at the hero monuments The RTS element is a continuation of the system started in Warcraft but with a few twists You must find a rune monument for one of the six races human monument dwarf monument etc and possess the appropriate worker rune building plans and unit plans to summon an army Once you summon your workers they can gather resources and build the necessary structures to summon an army The need to have the appropriate building and unit plans occasionally necessitates fully exploring each map so as to not miss any The levels of your military units depends on the level of the worker rune you used to summon your workers so as you find higher level worker runes your units will gain levels and become stronger Heart of Winter and Shadow of the Phoenix help add dozens of hours to the original Order of Dawn campaign granting you access to higher levels more powerful equipment new heroes and more advanced units One of my favorites was the Walking Fortress troll unit that hurls massive boulders at enemy structures You can import your avatar from The Order of Dawn into both expansions allowing this hero to complete an epic adventure Shadow of the Phoenix is very challenging and has some of the most ridiculous boss fights I have ever seen Several of them require your avatar the rune heroes and a full army to bring down a single foe Heart of Winter is an excellent continuation of The Order of Dawn adding new friends and enemies and Shadow of the Phoenix is a harrowing and challenging test of strategy and patience as your rune hero moves towards their ultimate destiny To sum it up this DVD has plenty of adventurous RTS RPG action wrapped around an engrossing fantasy yarn that should provide dozens of hours of quality entertainment Highly recommended 
Great game Worth the money get lots of hours out of it yet is closr to warcraft civilization style gam 
Nintendo releases pink to further please your mom your girlfriend or girls in general Im quite sure that your mom probally has her eye on the DS especially with the release of the DS Lite and games like Brain Age that your mother would want But I am also sure that your mom may not like the White color well that s good becausse The Coral pink DS will make it more fashionable for girls as well as maybe even attract a few guys as well no I am not gay steorotypical or homophobic I say to the people who first bashed the DS this is what you get for talking crap It might be astonishing that Sony is getting their butts kicked after all PS2 destroyed the Gamecube in terms of sales same thing with PS and N64 but some people just don t get the PSP That s fine but I like my PSP better basically because my favorite genre is racing And DS dosen t have Lumines or GTA or Locoroco and so on and so on But then again the DS has Mario Magnetica whatever It all depends on what you like best for most but since I am no fanboy or like videogames from all the far reaches of the galaxy I enjoy each and every system Now for the system YOu know you do not want to be bored with the tedious details and how everythng is better and all the other stuff you basically don t need but this system is ideal even for the people who have original DS s If you like the DS this system update is actuallly worth it The Stylus is way bigger it s certainly looks better it s easier to play better design and better system in general Sure you could say that you don t need it but that s fine Although for some people especially the Nintedno fans they just can t live without it and would definitly take it Myself included I got one very soon and also I give props to NIntendo for making sure enough was there to go around to everybody I have the White one but it s still the same great system although you would probally choose which color you want In short don t feel guilty if you shell out another 100 bucks it s really worth it If you don t have it it s worth it as you can get all kinds of cool stuff this fall and that includes a web browser So far though Europe is gett ing it before us 
This is too cute I had an old skool ds and it was ok When they released the lite I was skeptical about it It was right after the Microsoft 360 scandal and I was critical of new technology I wanted to wait until it had been out a few months to pick one up to see if it had any glitches I m glad I waited because they released the coral pink one I picked it up the first day and it s so adorable and perfect The ability to change the light levels is great the old ds was hard to play outside because you couldn t really adjust the lighted screen It s a soft pink color glossy and tiny I marveled at it s size compared to the old ds It s super hot The charger from the old ds DOES NOT fit into the ds lite so if you have the old charger old car charger it won t work That s not such a big deal since it comes with a charger but I was kinda sad that the old car charger wouldn t fit The stylus is better with a soft rubber tip instead of the hard plastic one the old ds had The colors on it are amazing The sound is pretty loud I find that I don t have to have it up very much to hear it fine I m glad nintendo finally realized that not every gamer is a d00d 
Nintendo does it again Nintendo DS Lite 2006 INTRODUCTION In late 2004 Nintendo premiered the Nintendo Dual Screen or Nintendo DS for short Despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike the new console quickly won audiences over It was Nintendo s best handheld console to date And in 2006 Nintendo released a smaller lighter version of the system appropriately called the DS Lite OVERVIEW Nintendo released the DS Lite in mid 2006 The new version of the system is smaller than the old version features repositioned buttons switches etc variable brightness levels and a few other changes from the classic DS It retails for about 130 00 and comes in three colors White Black and Pink REVIEW Nintendo did a good job revising the DS Many problems with the older version of the system are fixed Here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version THE GOOD SMALLER AND MORE COMPACT THAN THE ORIGINAL DS The original DS was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market and it was kind of a pain to haul around Finally we ve got a smaller lighter version of the system that can easily be transported VARIABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS You can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the DS Brighter levels use more battery power lower levels use less so you can plan out how best to use your battery s life FEATURES A CLIP IN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SLOT Unlike the original DS the Lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where Game Boy Advance games fit This helps to give the system a streamlined appearance and it keeps that slot cleaner COMPATIBLE WITH THE E READER The old DS due to its shape couldn t use the E Reader accessory The Lite model s shape is better all around and it can use it AVAILABLE IN THREE COOL COLORS Whether you want white black or pink there s a color for everyone REPOSITIONED BUTTONS AND THINGS Nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use REDESIGNED STYLUS The new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old DS and is an all around improvement COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER DS Since it s basically the same system you won t have any compatibility issues THE BAD SMALLER ISN T NECESSARILY BETTER IN EVERY WAY I have big hands and they fit the old DS fine Shrinking it actually makes it a little harder in some aspects to use all of the buttons STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRE GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES Of course I wasn t really expecting Nintendo to fix this STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAME BOY ADVANCE MULTIPLAYER Another thing I wasn t expecting fixed OVERALL Overall this is a nice improvement over the original DS There are problems but for the most part just the same problems the original had If you haven t gotten a DS yet definitely go for the Lite model EDITION NOTES The DS Lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come 
Surprisingly good I hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price Based upon various reviews and player feedback I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long a bit buggy and dumbed down Fortunately none of this was the case I had some good fun with this over a weekend yes it can be finished over a weekend and didn t come across a single bug Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind Oblivion Gothic 2 or some of the other great roleplaying games RPG out there but it does provide an enjoyable diversion Gameplay The controls are the typical WASD keys and mouse commands found in most single player RPGs The game is fairly easy to learn and navigate The story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood when he ll have to you know save the world There are no character classes per se but you can roughly play as a warrior magic user or stealth archer character or some mixture of these Much of the story centers around a main quest line but there are a number of side quests available Unlike most RPGs quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the Heroes Guild lol That s what it s actually called It s a rather artificial feeling system but it s functional Progression in the game is quite linear In most instances you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch since fences rocks and invisible barriers won t allow it Compared to more open ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard Overall it s a decent story but it is rather force fed to you The game includes several interesting touches People react to you based upon whether you ve performed good or bad deeds If you roleplay like a saint you ll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around Ladies and guys will worship you and you do have the option to buy a home and marry multiple times if you d like If you play as an evil character you ll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company The nonplayer characters in the game at least in the towns have jobs and schedules They work during the day and sleep at night though only quest related characters have anything to say of interest Although you can only play the game as the same guy you can customize him with tattoos facial hair haircuts and a small assortment of armor You can control how your character s skills develop but not as deeply as you can in a game like Morrowind or Baldur s Gate There are other small things that you can do such as fish play games of chance and treasure hunt Overall this game takes about 20 25 hours to do everything it has to offer so it is rather short for an RPG The things that I didn t much care for are not major but simply underscore the light weight nature of this particular game The game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd with hotkeys for burping farting and so forth The various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point There is nothing really offensive in the game it just feels a bit immature in places Also the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model You can t save just anywhere at least your quest progress will not save but the game will autosave at important junctures Graphics The game looks quite good Character models are convincing though a bit cartoonish and often repeated and the natural environment is screenshot beautiful in some places Since the pathing is fairly restrictive much of the scenary is noninteractive It s not like Oblivion or Gothic 2 where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it Sounds Voice acting is pretty good with the usual British accents that invariably seem to accompany such games The music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres Ambiant sounds are also decent Replayability Technical Issues The game is probably worth playing twice once as a good guy and once as a bad guy It will play similarly either way but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition Technically the game was perfectly stable on my computer no freezes crashes or other problems The manual is decent and explains much of the game along with the in game tutorial If you like RPG games and can get this one cheap go for it It s a well polished though simple rump through a fairly well rendered world Don t expect the same character depth engrossing story or exploring options that you ll find in some of the games that I mentioned above However Fable The Lost Chapters is good for several hours of entertainment 
Very nice RPG Back when it came out on Xbox I was incredibly angry I only had a silly gameboy but when it came out for computer I just had to have it I found the game very fun to play simple controls use arrows not wasd and felt very fufilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle It doesn t take long to finish this game but play is continuous if you watch the entire credits and you can always start over and switch to evil good side for a new version of the game 
Read this trust me Right just so everyone knows I have never played this game however i think you should read this I bought Fable and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it It is good enough but not supported so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible As they have actually put a list of cards on the site i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game Just thought you should know 
Fun but too buggy Okay the game very fun the different powers were easy to use and I like the Morrowind esque game mechanics This feels like a smaller scaled down version of Morrowind honest The graphics are nice and the engine is not a hog you can run them at fairly high res even on the clunker that I m playing on So what s the problem The freezes I reckon it happens about every twenty minutes while playing Without being able to save when you re on a quest it becomes annoying I don t have any sound card issues any fancy visual themes running like windows blinds bottomline these freezes should not be happening yet they are This should already have been solved by now but there are no patches or updates for the game That was arrogant of the game designers to presume that they would not encounter any problems that they would have to patch post release There s not even an option on the menu of the game to search for updates The freezes cripple the playability of the game so overall it s not worth paying for and playing in my opinion 
addicting but too much of I would be 5 on this one all the way because I enjoyed the game immensly the general idea of the game but because of personal preference I stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art If you like this game but don t want all the questionable material yes I know that it s nothing compared to other games then may I recommend Fate by wildtangen 
Not sure 5 or 3 stars Good Gameplay overall the combinations of enemies vs weapons spells is well done You can buy every weapon go back to easier parts and see how each weapon fights You have light heavy short long with different damage You also have the option of using different spells This is for those like me who want to prolong the game I can t block roll physically disabled so I go the best defense is a good offense strategy You have many options how to win = you can thus make the game more difficult or easy based on your decisions Weapons many choices Light Heavy Short Long low damage high damage Augmentstions etc You can try differnet weapons out per whatever part of the game if you want to proplong the the adventure Some weapons just plain look cool Spells well I have my favorites but tried them all Some work much better than others vs certain enemies You can pick and choose I believe you can beat the game with only 3 but I used my favorite 6 = to spice things up Story well thought out Battles many major fights XP Gem runs I can think of 3 spots where you can increase these important categories Nice when added to a game Bugs only a few desktop crashes XP SP2 All in all you are not overwhelmed with too many options Just get in there and fight Bad Voiceovers sounded like 1 2 people did all the voices Women Villagers basically the same model Romance well one giggles and talk the other actually seems to enjoy you The third option for a wife is a special NPC and seems to be reading from a poor romance novel Ok you can hit the ESC button If they wanted to go down this path the designers should have put more variety work into this option Why no romance with Whisper would have fit the story + changed the same ness Why no romamce with Briar Rose as as above Why no romance with a Bordello lady same as above Wouldn t fit with the story but changed the same ness If you decide to give them a refuge shouldn t the ladies talk to you be open to romance They just stood there and posed Why can t I buy clothes for my wives could buy a dress for myself Maps I liked the trek from the Guild to Oakvale much to do and fight I would go back and forth several times Hoped to run into Nymphs Seems once you get to Knothole Glade you really don t feel the need to go roaming and look for something to fight do Ok you have the Arena lots of fun here = unless you hero save you do it once Hook Coast just part path of the final showdown Snowspire well it s it if you do the last soul What was the point of talking to villagers getting married etc you spent no time in these places There could have been a cave or forrest or swamp or a combination to give one something to do while in these villages Seems the final 1 3 of the game is just rushed upon you you feel like might as well and just keep questing and get this over with I would have liked to slow down wander around etc If you didn t have the equipment spells by now you won t get them by coming to Hook Coast Snowspire All I can remember of value would be some xp or boosting potions If they were just quest driven locals then only the map would be needed = I saw no reason to get a wife buy anything at this point Hero Save ok if you want to do xp key runs I ve heard of crashing problems if you over do it But in those longer tougher quests do you really want to redo several hours if you die or want to stop I m on my 6th replay = about 240hrs So I obviously like this game Just I see room for improvement by adding or subtracting = taking the middle I feel the designers weakend the overall experience BTW Fable 2 is in the works for Xbox = I hope they don t go crazy with the system requirements once it comes to the PC Afterall how much better does a game have to look = Fable TLC is easy on the eyes I found myself just wandering and looking on the first few plays 
The King of all Dragonball games This game is a masterpiece of the dragonball name the graphics are nice certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation that looks like they took it from the show itself they didn t really do that You have the option of just playing the fusion characters by doing fusion and you don t have any time limit at all or you can just select the character by itself this goes for transformations as well Giant Ape characters Super Sayian levels not 4 as they put Goku and Vegeta ss4 as seperate characters Some of the bad parts from the first game don t exist in this game some of the characters didn t have the best moves list for the first game like SS4 Goku which he had full power energy balls Super Explosive wave and for his ultimate the 10X Kamehameha Wave It was also nice to put some of the lesser known characters in the dragon ball universe to be in the game as well Garlic Jr Turles Slug Jenemba s first form Pikkon Pan Ubb etc However not every single character is in this game which makes it look horrible when you play the story mode the following characters are not in this game GT Goku little and his super sayian forms Dr Wheelo Worlds Strongest GT Trunks and SS GT Goten and SS GT Gohan and SS GT Vegeta and his SS forms Bio Broly maybe we re better off not having him in this because I m sure that he wasn t very popular anyway the 6 other dragons General Rildo early part of Baby saga when the gang was on M2 Goku JR Vegeta JR This game is half tenkaichi and 1 3 of each budokai games 1 Dragon Universe is back but much better 2 Some things have been exclusive to the game in the first Budokai Cell accidently swallows Krillin instead of 18 and made a little story of of that every sayian character who had armor and a tail like Raditz for instance can transorm into a Giant Ape 3 Like Budokai 2 when you first started Dragon World you had a selection of Goku Adult Gohan and so forth in the adventure mode of this game in some of the later chapters they used Ultimate Gohan as GT gohan and Trunks with sword to make it look like your playing GT Trunks This has to be one of the cheesist things ever in any game This was the most impressive game in the series and will be the last dragonball game to appear on PS2 as we are heading toward the next generation of consoles A Wii version is coming out too 
Best Game Ever This is the best game made for the Xbox Well worth the money 
Fate may have placed us as foes but this ring will make us brothers As I finished the original Halo game for the X Box I found myself completely unimpressed With as much hype this game found upon its release I thought that it could have had more depth to it The characters story fight sequences and weaponry all seemed stale Once you passed the first level you pretty much saw everything there could be to see with the game It became repetitive over time with an ending that left you feverish for more It did not deserve the cult like status that it received Hesitantly I began playing the sequel in hopes that I could continue to trash this series as being nothing more than premature over hype by fanboys that didn t grow up in the Goldeneye generation Outstandingly this sequel impressed me Let me state that again this sequel was by far at least 100 better than the original so much in fact that I found myself asking why this wasn t the first in the series It drew me in for continuous play with engaging characters an extremely strong story and voices that made you proud to be fighting as either Master Chief or one of the downtrodden Covenant Halo 2 takes huge steps forward from nearly every facet of the original After playing Halo 2 the original seems like a modified version of Pong To begin with the weaponry is outstanding One of the major complaints that I had with the original was that the arsenal of weapons seemed minimal at best leaving a whole world of new weapons unopened Well in this game these worlds were opened and fully explored There were so many new and detailed weapons in this game I had trouble finding my favorite Thankfully the team at Bungie understood that I couldn t pick just one and finally encouraged Master Chief to use two weapons at once That s right boys we can double fist the Needler like it is going out of business This small change created so much more enjoyment for me because I could really wreak havoc from around the corner and there was plenty of havoc to reek This sequel not just gave you a game where you could sit back and create the explosions at any given time but also developed a structured story with amazing cut sequences that transformed the world of Halo into more than just a one dimensional game While Halo 2 boasts a shorter play time what appealed to me was the depth of the characters and the spectrum of what was happening to Earth during this apparent war In the original game I felt that my sole purpose was to destroy destroy destroy without any questions or answers That is not the case here where the missions seem intense the purpose is forthright and the unknown lurks deeper than imagined There were places we traveled in this game that I didn t think existed on the Halo playing field In my eyes Bungie took a small somewhat simple game and grew the playing field immensely The detail focused on the graphics were intense the introduction to this supernatural world was exciting and the deception of evil made me push further more than I did in the original This sequel was a game that you could turn the volume up on your surround system and fully enjoy the explosions the swooping of incoming enemy ships as well as the appropriately placed voice moments For anyone that loves to hear the illustrious voice of David Cross yelling quips and quandaries at you as you destroy any Elite than this is the perfect game for you It just felt like more icing on an already sweet cake Weapons voices a compelling story this is exactly what I expected from the original game but alas did not see it If this was the original release of the game than I would see the hype surrounding it Halo 2 was nearly flawless with the clear images the veracity of the A I as well as the compelling and detailed storyline Why couldn t you steal a vehicle from the enemy in the original I experienced enjoyment with this game as I made it to the next level unlike in the original where I knew that it was just going to be a similar fight with aged weapons This sequel compelled me to move forward into a deeper unknown But again it wasn t perfect While I will attest to everyone that Halo 2 was a million times better than the pathetic original there were still some small issues that need to be addressed The ending was horrid For a person that does not have nor does he plan to get at this time the infamous 360 I will be left with an open ended ending that really questions your loyalty to the finale The same issue happened with the first game with so much dedication and integrity to the meat of the game why not dedicate a spectacular ending The choice of armor for Master Chief seemed weaker than the original I dare not run into a fight this time but instead had to make me think about my attacks A bit annoying when you wanted to just run a suicide mission I also hated the fact that you could not throw grenades when you were dual wielding your weapons Master Chief is a strong man machine I strongly believe that he could do both which put me into some tougher situations sometimes Finally why was there a timed limit for the Arbiter to remain cloaked These may seem like small things to the big gamer but for me they could have been strengthened to create a tighter game Overall I cannot speak higher of this sequel For those that yell that the original is always better than any sequels then I would have to say Halo 2 is the exception Bungie took the opportunity to grow this empire and give us a view of this war from a dual angle making the universal terror greater and more relevant I enjoyed this game from the beginning to the struggled ending with all the excitement and enjoyment that I was hoping for with the original I highly suggest this game to those that were unimpressed with the first and do somewhat look forward to what the trilogy will encounter if we can get it without the 360 Grade out of 
A boomer loves it I m a 40 something guy and can t recall how many multi hour sessions were spent playing this game Simply lots of fun and I enjoy thoroughly the story line The Flood freak me out 
the best shooting game ever i love this game i have bought this game 3 times 
A game you can t put down I have been a staunch Final Fantasy fan for years While waiting for the newest release which kept being pushed back I tried out Xenosaga Let me tell you I am grateful I have This game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games I have ever played The world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique not to mention a plot that has profound depth You will fall in love trust me If you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours it is Xenosaga 
Awsome It s like a cross between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost In The Shell VERY COOL 
Great but not for everyone This game is good It has an excellent story line great graphics and an innovative battle system but it is extremely difficult It took me months to beat it and I honestly can t recommend it There was too much involved in beating it to really make me say it was worth it 
One of the best RPG s ever War has erupted between humans and an alien life force known as the Gnosis Man is in danger if nothing is done soon That s where Shion Uzuki the designer for the Anti Gnosis Weapons System known as KOS MOS comes in This game has a splendid opening it really gets you thinking about life itself the subtitle is also a book written by a philospher Anyway you start out on a space ship that is creating the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis However before completion the Gnosis attack your ship and KOS MOS starts herself up by herself From then on your basically thrown around to different areas exploring multiple storylines and trying to figure out why everything is happening The graphics in this game are similar to that of an anime game The characters have big googly eyes and look a little cartoonish especially Shion That s what really sets the mood for the game though The battle system is really unique and unlike any I have tried Basically you have physical or ether like magic attacks If you choose to guard during a turn the AP gauge will go up allowing you to do an extra more powerful combo Once you level up a lot you ll gain more of these powerful end moves that will allow you to defeat stronger enemies You re not limited to just the characters you also have AGWS units which are basically mechs I really was not disappointed in this game I loved it better than any RPG yes even FFVII This a great game for the PS2 collection I would highly recommend it 
Uhhh it keeps you online Hello all uhh there s not really much to this card but yeah it keeps you online for another year which is good its 50 bucks for the year long which is very cheap so yeah go out and buy this if your online PS online people add me my tag is Smiling Bob117 
Waste of money because of shipping charges The price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping Express or about 7 Office Depot who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not Amazon This much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke 
xbox rocks This site is the cheapest I have found for this card 60 br 62 Do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card 60 br 62 It s alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year 
Two reasons to get this card There are only two reasons to get this Xbox Live subscription card First as a gift for someone who already has Xbox Live and wants to renew his subscription Second the normal yearly fee is 50 so if you can get this card cheaper than that you ll save money This card is not a good way to get Xbox Live if you don t already have it For that purpose buy the starter kit ASIN B000209V8K which includes a free game a headset and a year subscription Without the headset Xbox Live is pretty boring 
Great gift for the Christmas season Hey You probably know at least one person who plays games on XBox LIVE And what with the Christmas season coming up this could be the perfect gift for him or her XBox LIVE is an online community of gamers Friendships are often formed and who can blame them what with the ability to actually to talk to someone who is playing the same game as you You re instantly in a community filled with people who like this one game you like and their are so many games which use LIVE for other things such as free downloads updates for games If you have a cable connection and an XBox you can t afford to not have XBox LIVE So if you know someone who has XBox LIVE get them a gift that will last a year Trust me they will enjoy it 
Xbox Live the Best Internet Gaming Ever I know I know But I have been playing online since the days of text based MUDDs Most of you reading this are way too young to even know what a MUDD was but back in 1982 we were playing them Yes I said 1982 I ve been playing online games just that long and have seen the evolution of just about every type of online game and environment you can think of I ve played Battle net and Heat net and just about every other online gaming service free or subscription based that there has been to play over the last 20 years Many of you may not even know what Xcite means but they were responsible for online gaming on the 16 bit systems SEGA Genesis and Super Nintendo I had those too amp quot So after playing online for nigh 20 years I had to ask myself what on Earth is Xbox Live XBL going to do that is so much more better about it than any other online experience than I have ever had amp quot this is what I was thinking before I signed up and I was very skeptical and rightfully so But once I was on and was playing my tune changed rather quickly In all the years that I have been playing online there has simply been no single experience as fun exciting and solid as the XBL experience yes even the PS2 Online experience is inferior to XBL It is quite safe to say that they last 20+ years of online gaming have been ultimately leading up to XBL Microsoft has taken all the best attributes of online gaming and infused them into XBL while leaving all of the worst attrtributes on the cutting room floor And check this out they are constantly improving the experience While you have a XBL subscription all upgrades for the service are free of charge And we get upgrades and improvements every few months The XBL experience is so good that many in even the PC gaming communittee prefer XBL over PC online gaming and are clamouring to get XBL on the PC and later this year they will finally have it Then there is all the tons of free stuff that you can get on XBL I cannot remember just how many new levels and modes and maps and soundtracks of various XBL games that I have downloaded in the last year for absolutely free And with almost 100 games available to use the service and that number looking to more than double itself by the end of 2004 that s just even more opportunities to downlaod more free stuff to my Xbox harddrive Inconclusion XBL really is the best online gaming there has ever been to date However you do not have to take my word for it you can find out for yourself for absolutely free Most XBL games these days come with a 2 Month Trial Card FREE in the game s box Just use that to sign up for a temporary account and you get full access to all XBL services for FREE for two whole months That s two whole months full access to the best online gaming service ever created If by then you feel that this is not for you then you are FREE to cancel the service without further obligation YOU CANNOT LOSE Anyway I play XBL everyday and I hope to see some of you there soon 
Starforce This game is great it definitely beats out SimCity4 in almost every department Graphics are nice the social subcultures are nice and the game is great overall I only miss the region overview but I m pretty sure if they copied THAT many elements then EA would have had pretty good grounds for a lawsuit cease and desist order Now onto the reason I rated this game a one overall I just paid the price of a full game so I could have Starforce installed on my computer Just the other day I was deleting Starforce because it came on another game of mine This form of copy protection is nothing short of malware and I ve already had one dual layer lightscribe DVD drive reduced to a worthless piece of scrap metal thanks to it I m getting tired of having to find cracks for Starforce games I buy legally just to avoid severe hardware damage To the point where I ve decided that I m not going to buy Starforce protected products anymore 
City Life Sim City 4 But Better I had saw an ad for City Life and I clicked it I read about it and thought it sounded so much better than Sim City 4 which I currently own that I decided to download and try the demo The demo was so much fun and it had many features What gives this game a unique twist is the social cliques You have to meet the needs of each cliques for example the different types of jobs they need What makes it realistic is it is just like real life The blue collars dont want to live next to the fringes whereas the rich don t want to live next to the poor or homeless What supprised me the most about this game though was the 3d graphics You can zoom in and out and get eye level with the people You can see them reading the paper on their picnic table in their backyard or walking down the street or taking the trash out Another neat feature is how easy it is to zone The zoning is such an improvement over SC4 This game makes you auctually have to get involved with your community making it your perfect town Now all I am waiting for is my copy of the game to come in 1 least 10 best Graphics 8 Simplicity 9 Fun 10 Realistic 9 Overall a great game for those who are tired of waiting for SC5 or for those who are just starting out with city simulation games 
CHRONIC MANUFACTURER S DEFECT Nintendo is aware of a manufacturer s defect that occurs with DS Lite and the regular DS game systems that come in colors not the silver one The plastic hinge closest to the power supply develops a stress crack that happens with simple everyday use Nintendo refuses to accept these cracks as defects and tries to attribute them to rough play We have owned 3 DS lites and all 3 have developed the same stress crack in the same spot all within 2 3 months of owning them The first one cracked enough to render the unit unplayable The same has happened to friends of ours While kids will be kids my kids certainly aren t playing touch football with their DSs There are dozens of websited dedicated to this problem just takes a little Googling some attribute it to overtightening during manufacturing Nintendo will not cover this repair under warranty but will be nice enough to reduce the 75 repair fee to 50 So when choosing a Nintendo DS Lite ask yourself if you want a brighter screen or a sturdier unit My 7 year old son who is on his 2nd DS Lite has just asked if he could have the original one for Christmas 
Excellent even for Brain Age Big Brain Academy only I purchased the Nintendo DS lite solely to use it with Brain Age and Big Brain Academy I have not used it to play other games and do not intend to do so I am still confident in giving it a 5 because keeping my brain active is worth it My wife also uses it daily Pros long battery life 8 12 hours is what I have seen easy to use compact possible use as internet browser if a card is purchased I have only seem them on e bay from Japan mixed reviews Con the biggest complaint is it does not utilize the built in WiFi by not coming with a built in internet browser not really interested in adding MP3 and JPG files but I would like to have the option to do so more educational games in line with Brain Age or Big Brain Academy Overall It is worth the 129 for the DS lite and 19 for Brain Age to start using your brain again 
Great with friends While I only own one game for the DS what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend s house with several other people all playing Mario Kart against each other and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used depending on preference Others like Mario Kart stick to the standard controls and others require the use of just the touch screen creating a very unique kind of game The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS it is worth it if it will be your only DS The Lite is better shaped has a better battery life and better brighter screens The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console 
DS Lite great fun Though I only have one game so far I found that the DS Lite was easy to start up and easy to get started on my game I cannot wait to buy another game for the DS Lite and try out other features 
Nintendo DS Lite Polar White At the time white was the only option Red would have pleased my child more I ve found SP games which claim to work with the wireless attachement do NOT work communicate with DS games But as for the DS Lite its a reasonable size perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer Now they offer Pink and Black which is nice but exchangable covers would have been nice The stylus is just barely managable for Adult hands but work fine for my child The screens are bright and no longer dimmable backlighting could be turned off in the SP One nice feature is many games allow some amout of co play with another DS even if your partner doesn t have a copy Stores like GameStop often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games Thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle so that s a bummer The biggest pain yet is I have not found a cable to communicate between the DS Lite and the SP one does exist for the DS to SP Oh an the power supply cable is different as well So while less bulky and better layout the DS Lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between SP and DS first versions not Lite Such is the proprietary way I d really like to see more adult software for these things They are not far from a PDA with their audio recognition and handwriting as well 
GREAT I had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario Two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as long as you do full charge during the night I was a game watch gameboy PSP player but once you start to use this machine you will instantly understand why this game machine became mega hit machine EASILY I am planning to purchase another one for my younger daughter to let them enjoy communication system with 2 machines 
Cheating The PS2 There are just so many different ways you can add a cheat into a game and beat the game You can either try the hard way through practice or you can access and enter a cheat code that was created by the compant that created the game or you can just enhance it Thanks to the people at Datel you can definitely punch in those codes with the Action Replay Max for the Playstation 2 It is simple and easy to operate There are also sveral different codes that are preloaded for so many excititng games like Madden 06 Jak Daxter or Need For Speed Underground 2 This is an absolute delight for anybody who owns a Playstation 2 and for anybody who definitely wants a shortcut to beating the game Price B+ Convience B 1 2+ Overall B 
Great game and not a bad price I liked this game I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok I mean it also comes with chrono trigger if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger 
One of the other FF collections to have This collection isn t as bonus feature happy as Anthology was this version of FF4 2 in the USA at the time of the SNES Genesis era hasn t changed that much the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version the switch between field world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era 7 8 9 Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version Squaresoft at the time put a S load of cinemas mainly ending cinemas has a list of music from the game and other stuff The gameplay is still the same with the exception of what I said earlier which is good otherwise unlike Anthology this collection has no bonus music CD for those who care anyway this is still worth owning anyway 
Excellent package but serious flaws in code Both Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger are excellent games CT could be my favorite game of all time Final Fantasy IV has been excellently restored to its original hardtype version Story elements and dialog have been restored which is extremely exciting However I have a complaint about the port Somewhere in the port the code for saving a game was not optimized for the playstation but instead uses a version that works fine on solid state memory like a cartridge which these games were originally on but horribly when going from CD to solid state This is a serious flaw as saves can take up to half a minute to complete That is why this game gets 3 stars on overall 
Chrono Trigger This is a good deal You get FF4 which was final fantasy 2 back on the super nes and the great game Chrono Trigger A must have for rpg lovers Plus the art for Chrono Trigger is by the same artist of Dragonball and Dragon warrior VIII fame The games are long and Chrono Trigger can have many diffrent endings depending on the choices you make Overall It is a must 
Yes FF IV was the one with Sir Ceical the Dark Knight I played this game back in 91 when I was 21 watching 21 Jumpsteet Even the dumbed american version of this game was fun and at the time the only good form of entertainment better than 21 junkstreet with Jonny Dork and Hollie Ugglieson and that stupid werewolf show whatever lame coorprate PC bull show we Xr s had availible to watch back then Sir Ceicel the Black Knight turned prettyboy Paladin was the talk of the day back when even though it is knocked today Nintendo Power had nothing but good things to say about this game and Ceicilboy and of course you could change his name I only wish they would release this on GBA instead of a big consoles so I could play it in bed like the lazy I am FFIII is actually a title not released at all in America and instead a faked FFIII V II Altough I like Final Fantasy I got reinterested when I got the FF Dawn of Souls for the GBA thier is a lot of grandiosing such as space travel and modern stuff mixed in midevil settings that I think is inappropriate I think it should only be midevil and mystical as in FF1 and 2 Japanese 1 2 not US 1 2 Why does Cece Rosa and company have to go to the friggen moon cartoon Amimea is weird that way but I beveve some of the lameness is replaced with a better plot this time around in the Japanese version for PS I still rate it Five before and after except for the moon crap and the machines which may or may not be there this time around 
Ups the ante on Star Wars games One thing about KOTOR 2 that greatly impressed me is how Obsidian taking the KOTOR franchise over from BioWare did not mess with a winning formula They faithfully carried over the first game s visual style presentation and atmosphere which means those who played KOTOR 1 can jump right in Just like KOTOR 1 the game hinges on its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features KOTOR 2 s storyline runs parallel to KOTOR 1 s and introduces a new protagonist whose only tie to the first game is that he she fought in the Mandalorian Wars Again the characters can be a bit flat stereotypical and will do most of the talking throughout the game you mostly choose how you ll respond to others through your dialogue choices The main reason why I would actually rate this game higher yes higher than KOTOR 1 is the intelligence of the script What I mean by that is how the game s characters challenge you both the main character and the person playing the game to think long and hard about some things that are regarded as truths Yes I m talking some serious philosophy here For example Kreia one of your allies challenges you to think about how a random act of kindness actually robs the person that s being helped of the chance to struggle fight and become stronger for it And a Jedi Master will challenge you to think about what to do if a cause you believed in strongly ends up doing just as much harm as it prevents In another instance the game shows the dangers of both blind allegiance AND independent thought yes the latter also has dangers And the best part is that all of this is presented within the context of the game s various scenarios without ever sounding preachy As far as the gameplay mechanics are concerned Obsidian spiced up the battle interface with new Force powers and feats which open up a new dimension to strategizing and outfitting your party Unfortunately it seems all the bugs and glitches from the first game were carried over as well such as the doorway bug and the menu bug And playing Pazaak is still just as hard As a nod to those who played the first game Obsidian decided to insert many references to KOTOR 1 here and there For example KOTOR 2 recycles two planets from the first game Dantooine and Korriban The maps are identical to the ones from the first game but this time you explore slightly different parts of the planets And people in the game are constantly referring to the Mandalorian Wars the war that was fought five years before KOTOR 1 s timeline and the Jedi Civil War the events of KOTOR 1 In fact you ll find that the Jedi Civil War casts a very large shadow over the lives of many people you ll encounter in the game including most of your allies You ll find that having played the first game certainly enriches this one although it s not crucial So in summary if you re suffering from post KOTOR withdrawal symptoms your prayer has been answered go buy this game NOW 
Left me wishing for more There are three things that matter to me when I sit down to play a game 1 Playability 2 The Story and 3 Graphics This game excelled in all three The ease of directing my character about and choosing his moves were so prominent and felt so natural that I just sort of fell into my character s role As in few other RPG games I didn t doubt for a second what I was supposed to do to move forward The story of the game is deep and riveting but more importantly sensible This is not just another action game with annoying throw away characters and subplots that go nowhere You actually care about the characters involved and you take a keen interest in what their future holds even the characters that you only get to see for a moment The ending is especially well done for it left me thinking about where my character would go next what he would do what path he would follow Even though I made his decisions throughout the entire game he was still his own character I simply shaped him a bit When I finally put the controller down and watched the credits roll up the screen I was heartbroken that it was over But then I realized that I could simply start all over again with a completely different character and end up in a completely different place A whole new experience If you re anything like me trust me when I say that this game is one of a kind And last but certainly not the least the graphics are fantastic and at times breath taking The graphics only work to bring out the story and characters and make the universe that the game is set in all the more believable They never fail to set the tone for whatever setting you find yourself in As with its predecessor The Sith Lords raised the bar for role playing games Role playing games such as Final Fantasy while still enjoyable in their own right tend to allow the player almost no freedom at all Sith Lords allows an astounding amount of freedom You can literally go where you want do you what you want however you want to do it Granted it s not Grand Theft Auto but then GTA is not a role playing game But while I am quick to point out the great aspects of the game I most also point out the bad The first major annoyance is that the game continually froze and I was forced to reset the system and start over To counter this problem you ll be forced to save often and on different slots the game even warns you to do so It s not really a big deal but it did get to me a little The second major annoyance was my inability to control all the members of my party proficiently the AI continally got me into trouble I could have avoided This is one of the problems the first Knights of the Old Republic had Other than that there s nothing else worth mentioning As with its predecessor I hold this game in the highest esteem and eagerly look foward to the next if there is one installment Enjoy the game 
To be Expected Quite honestly i think it is to be expected that the original would be better than the second especially with a series such as this where you choose what happens in the plot light or dark side With the first game of a series such as this its easier to write a plot that will run smoothly because you have a clean slate but with the second game you cant really make it so it runs so smoothly You have to make the game so it runs smoothly no matter which path you chose on the first game which i think is a pretty difficult task They did ok with this task but at times the actual story line was quite confusing but overall they did ok I do think they did a better job with the powers and such You were able to get a lot higher level then you did in the previous game so you received more powers The game was not awful by any means I think that if you play the game knowing its not going to live up to KOTOR 1 you will enjoy it quite a bit more I recomend that you play the first KOTOR before playing this one because then you will see the series at its full potential and appreciate it a lot more Also know that it s not going to be as good as KOTOR 1 when you start playing it helps quite a bit 
KOTOR II It s a fun game whether you are a star wars fan or not It has good story and good game play The game play is very much like the first There are a few problems when to select and object and your character gets stuck trying to run to it And the game becomes rather easy once you start getting into the higher levels Other than that it is a solid RPG 
aws good as the first one as i said about the first game kotor 2 is still one of the best rgp games for the xbox the bew story is close to episode 3 from the movies the jedi are in shamble and the sith are in power but you are the last of jedi so they thought you do find some familier faces from the first game like master vrook tmo4 revans battle droid bastila carth and thats about it only the droids are in your party though what is new about the game that you can influence your party members so you can bring them to the light or the dark but be warned if your going to get them on yopur side you have to do things they think is right some charitable acts will influence some but others will want to be brute force also you can influence them when your talking to them influenceing them does pay off by getting them to trust you more they will tell you things this will also bring more force points ect this one other then the first had that you can train some members of you party to becom jedi or sith depend on your path also the new classes have changed for the path of the light has 3 classes jedi master gives you better influence on you rparty members and have more force power and also can give party members stronger by using force points be advised it onlys last for a limited amount of time jedi weapons master lets you upgrade your 2 weapons fighting and upgrades on other fighting states the jedi watchmen is for the stealth types the sith marauder can enter afury inflicting more damage then before it almost like the jedi weapons master buy better the sith lord does just about the same but can weaken you foes by using force points i can t rember what the other one is but its the same as the jedi watchmen the sith lords are sheer amazing the one has cracks through all his body because he thrives on pain the other leeches on planets to feed his hunger for the force and the last one is a surprise well the game is great and the twists are perfect a must have like the other 
Nyko responds to so called defects On November 15 Nyko states Nyko is proud to announce that they ve shipped more than 500 000 Intercooler 360s to date helping consumers lengthen the lives of their Xbox 360s so they get more from their investment in next generation hardware The Intercooler 360 creates superior airflow which reduces the console s internal temperatures By maintaining better performance temperature throughout the Xbox 360 system the Intercooler 360 ultimately prolongs the life of the hardware which would otherwise be affected by the intense internal temperatures inside the console Recently a story appeared online claiming that the Intercooler 360 is damaging Xbox 360 consoles Although it looks as if the story came from an isolated incident NYKO takes any such claims seriously It is possible that a defective unit caused damage in the incident however it is impossible to confirm this is the case without inspecting the unit first hand and performing tests on the hardware Any number of reasons from a power spike to using the Xbox 360 without a surge protector could have caused damage Nyko stands by its products 100 and is confident in the Intercooler 360 and its reliability as a safe and effective means of lengthening the life of the Xbox 360 console While a small percentage of all products suffer from defects the total defect rate for the Intercooler 360 is well under 1 which is less than half of the average for consumer electronics products All consumer products will suffer from a small number of defects and Nyko is extremely proud of the low defect rates for the Intercooler 360 For those consumers who feel they have received a defective product Nyko will replace both the damaged Intercooler 360 and Xbox 360 console upon first hand verification that the Intercooler 360 caused the system to fail 
The most addictive game since Civilization This is truly an amazing game especially considering it s made by a small independent developer There s a virtually infinite number of different unit types spells and magic items so the game never gets repetitive and this is possible because it doesn t rely on massive amounts of graphics The different nations each have their own style of play The AI is challenging even when set to easy You can download new maps and other modifications from the internet I only reduced the rating to 4 because of problems with the interface It has a sort of unfinished feel to it For example when the game ends it always exits to windows rather than the main menu Also running a multiplayer game is very difficult and requires executing two instances of the game simultaneously 
An playable multiplayer turn based strategy game Difficult to learn and an awkward user interface besides that this is the best turn based strategy game I ever played It is ideal for Offline Multiplayer Serverbased or via PBEM since all players take their turns simultaneously which allows PBEM games to be finished within reasonable time Highly customizable OS independent Disappointed by WalordsIV I am now very happy to finally have found a cute playable turn based fantasy strategy game 
If you re a fan of the old classics If you aren t daunted by a little detail in a turn based strategy game and you don t mind graphics that fall short of the quot latest eye candy test quot and you re willing to spend some time bringing yourself up the learning curve you ll LOVE this game If you find any of the above 3 make you doubt you probably shouldn t get it But for me a turn based strategy junky to the core this game is an absolute gem Probably the best I ve bought in the last 5 years For a specific niche of gamer out there this one is extraordinary 
Another blast from the past that doesn t disapoint Square Enix is going back in time with their latest Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS titles First we had Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the GBA which were brilliant recreations of the original Nintendo Entertainment System titles that started the Final Fantasy series way back when Then last year we had the first SNES Final Fantasy game in Final Fantasy IV Advance on the GBA which recaptured the fun that really made the series a house hold staple keeping the game the same as we remember with extras added in to make it even more fun then we remembered Final Fantasy III which was a Japanese only exclusive NES game is now on the Nintendo DS introducing a new yet old game to fans old and young Now with thier next title in Final Fantasy V will Square Enix again capture the magic that made their old games so much fun The answer is absolutely yes This game is a great example of why the job class system that Final Fantasy has become well known for is so much fun to interact with You start out with a team of four who have to save four special elemental crystals from being destroyed Every time a crystal does happen to be destroyed the crystals will lend the would be heroes it s powers letting them change thier classes into more powerful fighters magic users and specialist in the hopes of saving various worlds from a great evil in the name of Exdeath The story can be a bit on the weakside Besides the point of fighting evil just because they are good guys and that s what good guys do there is not much more to the story then your typical Final Fantasy situation The real draw of the game is the idea of building your dream team of characters in the classes you want to build them into Some of the classes most will be familiar with if you have played a Final Fantasy Tactics game There are some new and unique ones but over all they all have their pro s and con s and let you switch between them easy enough while being able to use previously learned abilities from one job into another job There are your typical classes in the Knight Black Mage White Mage Monk and Thief While there are more obscure job titles like Berzerker Dancer Beastmaster and Bard that add a lot of originality and newness to the game as it lets you be classes that you may have never thought of being in a Final Fantasy world A lot of the game will focus around you leveling up due to the fact that the only way to learn new skills for your current classes are to gain job points by winning battles Also it can get quite expensive buying equipment for all the different classes as a lot use very specific weapons like whips bows and axes while most use swords and daggers So this game is not one that you will be able to rush through quickly if you want to get the full experience out of it Overall this is a great addition to any fan of a good RPG series both young and old The story is the only weakness as it could have been a bit better but the fun of the game and your own ability to choose what type of fighters you want to use at any given time make you forget quickly of the story going on and keeps you focused on the action and having fun with the many classes to find With three worlds over 20 class choices bonus classes and dungeons not found in the original games and so much more to do in this game you definitely can t go wrong picking this up A very worthy yet not as well known game in the long running Final Fantasy series Especially with Final Fantasy VI Advance on the way this is a great way to pass the time until it becomes available This isn t the greatest Final Fantasy game but it seems to fit in perfect to the portable setting it has been put into Get it today so you too can max out all the job abilities for all the characters 
I have my sources My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It s a MUST HAVE 
It s Alive Before Kurt Warner had a career with the St Louis Rams he played for the Arenabowl champion Iowa Barnstomers when he endorsed this game called Kurt Warner s Arena Football Unleashed The music is rockin and up to date you can crank it up to The sound effects are great on this game if you hear that doink sound it looks like a Hanna Barbera cartoon and the commentary is way better than that Tim guy from NFL Blitz Oh and for every touchdown you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6 This game is way more better than NFL Blitz unfortunately it was the last hope for any more Arena Football games on any system 
Yeah baby Even though other people doubt the gameplay of this game it is still cool Yeah it should be quot leashed quot Well I don t care what he says I m an AFL fan and I say this deserves 5 golden stars Go Red Dogs 
NOT ARENA NFL When I played Kurt Warner Arena Football for the first time I was dissapointed because at first I thought It was going to be like a real arena football game like madden or gameday but to my suprise it was like blitz and nfl extreme so if you want to buy a real football game buy madden 2001

Doesn t impress too much I like the 05 version better Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it doesn t appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much I won t buy the 07 when it comes out I ll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3 
it is a decent game the good it has fairly good graphics the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 didn t like the truck stick and nfl superstar the bad once you ve played this for awhile you ll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game it get old when you look into the crowd in a game the graphics suck it looks like a big blob of colors overall it is a really fun game i hope madden 07 will be better though 
very fun except superstar mode My expertise actually is in Rpg s but I ve always been a Madden fan so I think my opinion can be usefull to someone wanting to know about this game This is your classic madden game very fun very addictive and very challenging franchise mode is the best feature Basically you pick your team and then you decide how much to pay the players in order to keep under the salary cap which players to dump and rehire and pretty much everything else it takes to run a team which is a lot of things Then their is the online mode where you play players from all over the country After you play all of the other modes this feature can keep you entertained clear until the next madden game comes out The only problem is that some online players know how to cheat EA sports strongly denies that it s possible to cheat online and many good players get mad when someone talks about cheaters online because the good players think that people who blame other s for cheating are just sore losers which is true a lot of the time However after personally seeing some of the things my computer nerd brother can hack into and do I think anything is possible on any website There are a ton of people out there that are a lot smarter than you and me and they can figure out how to cheat at anything Finally the only reason that made me drop my rating from a 5 star overall to a 3 star overall The infamously not so popular superstar mode Super star mode sucks You have to retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr to get the pedigree parents you want On top of that you can t fully get your player to a high rating in all the categories that make a good player speed agility strenth etc You can improve the player s stats but never to where you eventually want to get them Also when you finally get an agent that get s you access to the performance institute it doesn t do much good because using the performance institue only increases your stat s temporarily But I have some good news I ve heard through the grapevine that in Madden 07 this feature will be greatly improved You ll be able to run the 40 yard dash so you can acually get a speed rating higher than a lousy 88 You get to do the bench rep to decide your own strength So at least in Madden 07 you ll have more control of your player s skills This is the best thing about Madden The people who make these Madden games must have took notes when they learned about evolution in school Every year Madden adapts and improves the flaws in last year s game much like what football coaches do with their team s in real life The cool thing is that they actually take advice from their fanbase Unlike most game companies When Madden comes across a problem they adapt and fix the problem This game probably deserved a 4 star overall rating instead of a 3 star overall rating but when a video game company adds a new feature to a game it better be cool Because it really pisses me off if they go through the trouble to add a new feature to get us all really excited and then the new feature ends up beeing stupid 
Great game except for This is a fun game the only thig i can say is that i wish PS2 or sony could have a web site where you can download the current rosters and the next seasons games It kinda sucks if i want to play next season i guess i will have to go out and buy madden 2007 with updated rosters 
Disney AND Final Fantasy How can one go wrong Anyone who has ever played the original would know that the whole point of kingdom hearts is to beat the stuffing out of the heartless with nifty weapons known as keyblades Well this time around you get to beat the stuffing out of heartless and a new brand of villan known as nobody s With a compelling story line and great voice acting donald and goofy act and sound just like their dsney versions kingdom hearts 2 delivers in every aspect of gameplay except for one the summons I love this game don t get me wrong but i felt that they really could have added a couple of more summons into the mix to make the battle system that much more fun the original had roughly 7 summons all together and this one has only 4 Square how about adding a couple of final fantasy summons into the gameplay cough cough BEHEMUT Either way this is a great game one that any final fantasy or disney fan should pick up 
Believe the hype I was a big fan of the first Kingdom Hearts it was truly a unique game Melding the worlds of Final Fantasy with Disney was a very interesting idea and its one that worked Kingdom Hearts II continues with the same basic formula so if you liked the original you will most definetly dig this one Everything that the oringinal did well II improves on The combat system is a vast improvement over the original and it remains fun over the 30+ hours In fact I wish there was more to experience Its that fun If your a disney fan you will dig being able to fight along different disney characters and explore those worlds All are very well done and diverse some in particular are just breathtaking The Pirates of the Carribean world comes to mind and its just awesome You actually feel like your apart of that world as you fight along with Captain Jack Sparrow The voice acting and animations add too the immersive nature Its amazing how well they get Johnny Depp s character you would think it his him in the game when he actually had nothing to do with the production The square characters get some great treament in the game as well as you run into many of them You ll even fight along side some of them and thats a treat as well If your a Final Fantasy fan you will absolutly eat up the more FF inspired moments in the game and it more than makes it a worthwhile experience if your not into disney The real draw for me is the story One of the best and most moving stories I ve ever had the pleasure of playing Its very interesting actually Surprisingly you start the game not playing Sora You play as Roxxas for the first 5 or so hours It serves as a introduction world but Roxxas is a key character to the story and you will have a blast playing as him Another thing I liked is that the story wraps up quite well you are not left hanging It has a satisfying conclusion and is much better than the first games ending Square Enix once again shows why they are one of the best in the business Kingdom Hearts II is a very polished product from the art style character designs the music on down to the extremely well done FMV s Its not without flaws it was a tad short for me I finished it under 35 hours and it was supposed to be much longer But regardless its a incredible journey and well worth devoting the time to play 
Just as good as the first If you liked the original then you will also like KH2 It finishes the story nicely Battle commands are improved I especially like the Reaction commands Still has some camera issues Overall a good game 
Keepsake Great game lasts a long time challanging puzzles some easy some hard A lot of running around if you don t pay attention and save save save it also helps to take some notes Overall the best game I ve played recently 
A wonderful game I play adventure games on a regular basis and I really enjoyed this game for the following reasons 1 The storyline is well put together and made sense 2 The scenery can be quite breathtaking 3 The puzzles range from quite easy to extremely difficult but there is always the chance to get hints or if you spent way too much time on the puzzle and its time to move on you can get the solution 4 The main character interacted with others on a regular basis I m so tired of never encountering another person in adventure games 5 I initially thought the characters were going to be quite shallow and predictable but things change Great job on this one It s certainly one of my all time favorites 
Pretty Much Fantastic Best friends Lydia and Celeste were separated eight years ago when after the death of her mother Celeste s father became a director of the far off Dragonvale Academy Now Lydia is about to start her first day as a student of magic at Dragonvale and looks forward to being reunited with her friend But when she arrives she finds the academy deserted except for one odd character a wolf who claims to be a dragon Where is everybody What s going on here Can this wolf really be trusted These are just some of the questions you must answer as you explore the school Keepsake the first game from the Canadian Wicked Studios is a lovely 3D point and click adventure in the tradition of Syberia And I mean lovely literally the first thing to strike you is the beauty of the environments The castle is ornate with knotwork motifs and colour themes making exploration a pleasure There isn t a lot of animation but what there is is well done the water effect was especially nice Characters are slightly less well realised but still quite good The sound is also quite good The music is beautiful with a different haunting motif for each character and section of the castle The f x are somewhat limited and a bit repetetive lots of footsteps and bird calls fire and water sounds etc However they fit well with the design of the rest of the game so I can t complain I m very surprised to see so many complaints here about the dialog I really saw nothing wrong with it or the voice acting Rather conversation is used to explain points that are not necessarily elucidated by the action the philosophy of the magical system for example as well as to develop the characters and their relationships I considered that good writing not the opposite The game starts with a cute little tutorial in which one of the other game characters leads you through the controls I kind of liked that as I dislike reading manuals and it obviated the need for the kind of introductory sequence you find in a lot of games of this type you coul just jump right in The puzzles are quite a mix several straight games a couple mechanical including one that s quite involved some riddle type some inventory a kind of slider and a huge maze not counting the castle itself that is There are no timed puzzles and you can t die I liked the way the inventory worked once you had acquired the requisite item it was automatically used in the relevant spot So you didn t have to keep opening your inventory picking up the item clicking it on the hotspot etc As for the rest they were fairly straightforward EXCEPT for the riddle type The clues provided were so obscure that I can t believe anyone but the designers could possibly make sense of them Fortunately the game includes a hint feature which give three hints for each puzzle after which it offers to solve the puzzle for you I had to use the solve feature once when even having the clues explained didn t do much to enlighten me But when you use the solve feature you don t actually get to see the solution just the result of it So I still don t know what that puzzle was about The hint feature also will tell you if you don t have the prerequisistes necessary to continue a puzzle If you use it when you re not in puzzle view it will clarify your next objective I found both these aspects very helpful I did experience one bizarre glitch with the game at intervals without reason or warning the sound would suddenly start to stutter and echo in a most annoying way Adjusting game settings had no effect I eventually discovered that I could correct the problem by exiting the game and rebooting my computer This seemed to be necessary once every couple hours I completed Keepsake in about 25 hours possibly a little more I was deligthed that it kept me busy so long as most adventure games these days barely provide 10 hours of play Some of the second part of the game did get a little draggy with a lot of toiling back and forth through the castle However Keepsake is a good choice for gamers who like straight adventure in a fantasy context But for the glitch and a couple illogical puzzles I would have given it five stars I eagerly look forward to Wicked Studios next effort 
Fun Fun Fun Ok this game was overall fun There are however moments that just make you want to slap whoever designed it When you are in this school for most of the whole game it is huge and you are walking everywhere Sometimes when there arises a puzzle you have to walk all over the school to find the answer Then when you think your almost there you are on the top layer of the school This is better because now you can just teleport everywhere where as you couldn t do that before But you are still trying to figure out which teleport to take Yes the acting is lacking but who really cares I did love the scenery with the waterfalls and such Very beautiful and the puzzles were good too Some of them seemingly impossible to solve and some very easy I am a person who loves to try and figure out things and if you don t use any cheats or help this should take you a while to get through I enjoyed it really I did Just make sure you have alot of time to play it 
I disagree The books are awsome I have read almost ALL of them and really wanna play the game thanks for all the great reviews I just wanna say the books are not stupid They are all very very good You just have to actually READ the 
Family Fun All the family have played this game and have had a blast Sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids The graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun We also own the movie 
not bad at all get it now before it s gone I wasn t sure if I wanted to purchase this game because it got so many bad reviews From Magazines Amazon reviewers and G4TV However because I love Puss N Boots and because of the recent price drop I decided to give it a go Well it s not like final fantasy as many have compared it to It s more like Gauntlet Dark Legacy The graphics are really good To address another criticism the game is not a cheap movie novelty created from left over scraps My only complaint is that you can t choose the characters you want for each level They are choosen for you However you can switch from the 4 characters given and most of them are cool Fun Factor=3 5 Replayability=3 Graphics= 4 5 Controls=5 Camera Angles=3 5 Mostly young teens and under will enjoy this game Even if you dont like shrek this game will appeal to Grims fairy tale fans like me I got mine new from EBGAMES for only 9 99 hurry before they are gone 
From 4 to 15 and beyond This game has been enjoyed by the family from my 4 year old who likes to play Fiona on up to in clude friends of the family The game loosely follows the movie with the additions of other characters and does not require high skill levels to play The contols are simple and you can pick it up and put it down without losing any of the momentum of knowledged gained while playing It is good simple fun

Necessity Anyone witha PS2 has one It s that simple It s not exactly great because because it s annoying in the first place that the feature of memory wasnt on the PS2 in the first place 
A terrific finish to a wonderful trilogy Not quite as programming sound as Sands of Time SOT but thankfully far removed from The Warrior Within WW The Two Thrones TT is arguably the most enjoyable of the three next generation titles Visually TT is a masterpiece Advancing upon the beautiful artwork in the first two offerings TT presents a gaming environment that a gamer can truly grasp his her eyes around Lighting facial expressions body language even pottery specifics are all drawn to perfection The audio is in sync with these strengths the music is terrific sound effects digitally crisp step on your first dinner plate or pot to get a sense of this Moreover gone are most of the blind jumps in WW camera glitches of SOT The characters themselves and the weapons they carry are likewise individualistic works of art UBISoft Montreal obviously thought this one through from the flaws of the previous two entries when creating visuals The control scheme is similarly quite polished SOT still lays claim to the tightest of all 3 but TT is close behind Perhaps a by product of a visual environment that is truly interactive Stealth mode is a blast and perfectly fused into game dynamics From a pure gaming perspective absolute genius The dark prince is a hoot to play + a wonderful change of pace the challenges that face you suitable for the gaming stage you encounter them Unlike WW secondary weapons are now key elements of gameplay Weapons racks are appropriately placed to provide a weapons edge when needed Finally puzzles while ocassionally more frustrating than fun can be conquered A Prince of Persia veteran will most likely not require a FAQ a stalwart of WW unfortunately to conquer TT A newbie will require a moderate high learning curve This game however is not without flaws Several reviewers refer to frustrating encounters in the game the second chariot + the boss battle that follows is the most obvious that will require dual save points and sufficient sands of time stored well in advance to proceed past Not to mention a glitch that might require a restart of the entire game Ugh These are by products of a second rushed title expedited to keep gamers interested after a poor WW As someone who has played every Prince of Persia title since its first offering TT is a nice return to its roots For new gamers and as alluded to above I highly recommend playing out the entire Sands of Time series in its release order TT will both make a lot more sense while seeming more intuitive as a result Not to mention a storyline that keeps you glued for just one more save point Highly recommended Will be fascinating to discover what and where the next Prince of Persia will be and appear on 
WOW First off this game is very addicting and so much fun Prince of Persia The Two Thrones really takes you back to what was so great about Sands of Time One thing I really found enjoyable about this game was the story You really find yourself attached to certain characters and it brings you into the game Another great thing about this game is the gameplay which again brings the player back to the greatness of Sands of Time One thing I fing great is all the action that is encountered throughout the game Having the ability to sword slash through enemies gives this game a nice balance Without this the game would be purely platform and while this could be fun it definetely needs the action to keep it feeling alive The ability to use the quick kills is also very entertaining The bosses in the game are also fantastic Each of them are very different in the way you fight them which is something I found to help keep the game fresh Some are very platform feeling the way you fight and others are much more action quick kill like Another cool addition in The Two Thrones is the Dark Prince Although at times he seems a bit overpowered the addition of him was well needed and made the game very fun Overall I thought this game brought back the feel of Sands of Time and although it still lacks slightly in gameplay than the first it is still great and definetley better than Warrior Within Presentation The story is great and keeps the player attached to this game It is truly back to its roots and people who liked Sands of Time are going to love this game Graphics The graphics in this game are very nice and the environments are fantastic Sound The voice acting in this game is fantastic The music is also great and definitely creates a nice mood for the game Gameplay The gameplay is great I love the quick kills and they truly add a new demention to the game Lasting Appeal The game feels a bit short can be beat in 7 10 hours Although there are unlockables there isn t that much incentive to play through the game all the way through a second time 
Two Princes one Outcome Prince of Persia The Two Thrones Circa 2005 GOOD More balanced combat when compared to pervious game Prince of Persia Warrior Within New Speed kill system although difficult some times make stealth kills dramatic and flashy Use a Chariot in some levels Boss battles are more balanced when compared to pervious game Prince of Persia Warrior Within Play as the Dark Prince an evil version of the prince on some levels Note that Dark Prince has different powers abilities and acrobatics Lots of unlockable art work and mini movies BAD Dark Prince Levels feel like there timed because his health is always slowing falling Chariot levels could be better IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE This Prince of Persia game really is a combination of the last two games in terms of story more like that of Sands of Time and gameplay like that of Warrior Within although there is enough new elements to make it feel unique If you liked the pervious Prince of Persia games you will most likely like this as well GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO Prince of Persia Sands of Time Prince of Persia Warrior Within ADDITIONAL NOTES Bonus section has pictures movies from all three Prince of Persia game 
Back to Good The end of the Sands of Time trilogy marks a successful return to the style and fun of Prince of Persia Sands of Time The Two Thrones combines the good fighting mechanics of Warrior Within WW with the downright utter enjoyment that the Sands of Time SoT started two years ago The story picks up where WW left off with the Prince returning home to Babylon Before you know it the sands of time make a comeback and the Prince is left in peril in order to save his kingdom All the great platforming tasks of insane jumps and crazy obstacles are here as are most of the sand powers found in the first two iterations Gameplay is the same for the most part The new speed kill system is quite fun but some may find it eases the fighting difficulty quite a bit That being said its not always the easiest thing to pull off especially when multiple enemies are involved but a cool addition none the less The graphics look better than ever a slight improvement over WW and a remarkable improvement over Sot which was jaw dropping only two years ago The rendered cut scenes look good and the sound is clear including all the voice acting where the original actor from SoT has returned to voice the Prince He does a great job again and really adds to the overall quality of the game The music is a return to the orchestral sounds of eastern decent and the hard rock has left the building to much acclaim This game is very linear which some people may stray away from There is no multiple back tracking like WW However it is enjoyable from start to finish Even the new chariot races are interesting but some may find them slightly out of place There is one Boss fight in particular that will cause many frustrating moments to all After a few times or perhaps dozens studying the patterns and getting your attack down it becomes no problem I did experience one glitch that caused my game to freeze at a certain point several times After searching around on message boards it seems to be a common problem I was able to get past it after resaving over the save point file A word of advice have at least a few different save files along the journey so you don t have to start over at anytime The ending is completely appropriate to the trilogy and leaves you hoping the Prince will one day return This game is a little on the short side At around 7 8 hours for me to complete it seemed shorter than the previous two All in all a great game A must play for anyone who enjoyed the previous two or for fans of third person action adventure You owe it to yourself to play the first two beforehand though if only to see the story from beginning to end and to experience one epic adventure 
BEST OF THE SERIES I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS GAME AND I HAVE NOT PUT MY CONTROLLER DOWN THE STORYLINE IS AWESOME THE GAME IS VERY WELL BALANCED GRAPHICS SUPERB THE FIRE EFFECTS ALONG WITH THE TORN DOWN BABILONIAN CITY JUST LOOKS AMAZING SO NICE THAT YOU JUST STOP PLAYING AND STARE FOR A WHILE YES ITS THAT GOOD THE MUSIC IS 100 ADEQUATE ARABIAN NOT LIKE THE RIDICULOUS ROCK THEMES FROM PART 2 ON THIS ONE HE HAS LIKE A DOUBLE PERSONALITY ALTER EGO TYPE ON THING WHICH ALSO ADDS KUDOS TO THE GAME IN OTHER WORDS THE PRINCE NOW LOOKS AS SLICK AS DANTE AND GOD OF WAR AND RYU FROM NINJA GAIDEN YES IT GIVES YOU THAT BAD FEELING FROM WHAT I HEARD THIS GAME HAS AN AWESOME CONCLUSION IT IS TRULY A MUST HAVE SINCE THIS WRAPS UPS THE TRYLOGY AND IT DOES IT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY GIVING YOU THE BEST EXPERIENCE YOULL EVER GONNA HAVE WITH THE SERIES OHH I ALMOST FORGOT THE STEALTH KILLS TOTALLY AWESOME ITS A QUICK WAY TO DISPATCH OF YOUR ENEMIES WITH THE TOUCH OF A BUTTON IF DONE IN PROPER TIME AND BOY DOES IT LOOK GOOD YOU CAN ALSO HANG FROM YOUR DAGGER ONCE YOUR AGAINST A WALL AND FROM THERE RUN SIDEWAYS AND EVEN JUMP THE OPPOSITE WAY AMAZING SO MANY NICE THINGS ABOUT IT THAT MY FINAL WORDS ARE BUY THIS ONE IT DESERVES IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT ITS SOMETHING TO HAVE OVER THE TIMES 
So good I bought another I bought the KRP bundle and then bought Karaoke Rev 3 I soon realized that I needed to get another mic We use the games so much I haven t had any problems with the mic yet But even if we did you can get it used and new for under 14 I m going to eventually get a 3rd just to have it on hand when the first one inevidably fails I m glad I spent the money on the Karaoke Rev game line I was very disappointed with Sing Star The next thing that needs to happen is a wireless mic 
Works with Mac I actually bought this to use with my Intel Mac Mini because it was the cheapest usb mic I could find Wasn t 100 sure it would work but it does and for the price I d say it performs excellent 
Playstation 2 Microphone The product is very sturdy and very much more durable for smaller children than the headset microphone Purchased my daughter the headset microphone for Christmas and it was broken in a few days We purchased this one after and it has withstood quite well Great product 
Perfect for Karaoke Revolution If you re going to play Karaoke Revolution this is the mic for you I now have 2 so that my wife and I can play in duet mode It s much better than the headset For just 17 bucks you can have a real mic that feels so much more natural If you play KR a lot invest in this microphone 
Logitech Mic for PS2 I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2 The quality of the sound is awesome and my kids are having a blast with it The price is reasonable My kids take very good care of things but I m not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment I will probably end up buying another one 
One of the best games I ever played I bought this game over four years ago and just have to say I must of replayed this game at least a dozen times Start Finish This game was one of the major reasons I bought an Xbox then an Xbox 360 If you like to play shooters this game is for you The graphics even by today s standards are very good The campaign is best thought out story I have ever seen even better than movies The only thing this game lacks is online play but this game was released just before Xbox Live came out If you want to play online get the PC version or buy Halo 2 Once you beat this game get Halo 2 it was also an extremely good game Halo 3 will be on sale for the Xbox 360 in a year hopefully less 
One hundred and ten percent This game is the latest in a series of universe changing and unbelievably addictive first person shooters First there was Wolfenstein I barely slept for weeks Then DooM and DooM II blew Wolfenstein completely out of the water Then Quake made you permanently renounce your allegiance to DooM Then Half Life made you say DooM DooM who And Halo will make you permanently forget all of those 
Simply Amazing I just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars I had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox I ve been a PS2 fan for a while After I played the first couple of levels I was not dissapointed This game is simply amazing even today I can t possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out The gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics The sound and music to the game is awsome I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning 
Loads of fun This is my first experience with Sim City I ve never played with the earlier versions Important Note The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case Well I looked and looked and it wasn t where the prompt said it would be After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me I finally found the code It s on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case You ll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual not in the lower left corner The tutorials are helpful so if you re new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first And if you feel you need to go through them again you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over I ll built a small city and I ve only had this game for a day but I know I m going to love it 
Econ 101 This is a very entertaining game It isn t one of the action packed varieties but it has given me hours of enjoyment without the pressure of being shot at It s not for everyone but if you like to master the basic economics of building a city it s fun 
This is a GREAT game Computer games have a bad reputation They re violent mindless escapist blah blah blah Mostly that reputation is well deserved computer games are entertainment and as such they re designed to take our minds off of the real world for a while What s wrong with that SimCity 4 is not a typical computer game You need no coordination at all you don t need to accept any fantasy world there s no one to shoot at or anything to shoot with either there are no mazes to run and so on What there is is an ability to see the real world but in a way you WANT it to be rather than as it is In one form or another SimCity has been around for many years This version is part of its continual evolution I ve owned two earlier versions and I found this one to be the best yet in terms of features and operation It works the way its supposed to A side benefit to SimCity is that its long history has allowed a huge on line community to develop There are hundreds of sites offering chat help with issues templates for cities etc You certainly don t need these sites to make full use of the game out of the box but they are there One of the most interesting things about SimCity is the way it demonstrates that education and entertainment aren t mutually exclusive As you play you are forced to come to terms with issues like the relationship between tax rates and business growth parks citizen satisfaction and public works budgets pollution and economic development etc However none of these lessons is explicit they just dawn on you as you play because you see the consequences of your decisions I have heard that very young kids understand and appreciate these issues after a short time playing I tend to measure entertainment value in terms of fun per unit of money In that regard SimCity 4 is an outstanding entertainment value I ve liked the past iterations of the game I like this one even better and I ll almost certainly buy the next version too 
A good Replacement to cable We had a cable go bad on us and I could never find a replacement Finally I saw the wireless device I bought this for my daughter She and I play pokemon on GBA We no longer have to be within cable reach but at least in the same room Matter of fact we have more fun now The wireless is faster than cable Its easy to put on and take off You can hook up with multiple players using the wireless Note you can t use the wireless and cable its either or Also with GBA you have to have the newer games that says wireless Its not backwards compatible Recommend this device and the GBA TV Adapter 
One of the best fighting games on the ps2 Fans of this game s genre are always looking for a great fighter for their console and because their are comparatively far less fighting games it s quite rare to find a trully impressive one Tekken however has always taken the cake when it comes to a deep fun and proffesional fighting experience and does Tekken 5 have all these great qualities Definetly Whether you re a hardcore gamer or just want to have some fun with your buddies you ve found the perfect title Namco does an extremely fluid job of breaking all the barriers of fighting game entertainment There is so much veriety so much to do to unlock to enjoy that whether you like these types of game or not you will be hooked Take me im a critic a tough one for that matter and I can t find a single thing wrong with this game other then the fact that an online mode wasn t included But how much will it matter when you have a rich deep gameplay system extrodinary visuals outstanding replay value and 30 count them 30 intruiging playable character to battle with and master I say this without a studder this will have you playing for hours upon hours with a friend or relative becuase this is one of those games where there is little more to ask for 5 
Graphics overhaul but audio is neglected To be sure the graphics have had the most significant update since Tekken 2 And Namco was very careful to keep the gameplay mechanics perfectly in tact However the Tekken 5 BGM tracks didn t seem to keep pace with the innovation A few good songs here and there but overall not a cohesive OST 
I Love this Game In terms of overall quality this game is light years better than Tekken 4 The graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature I especially love the customization feature My only problem is playing against Jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him Other than that this game is terrific 
Demons Rule This is a vary good game one of the best on the PS2 these are my top ten favorite fighters 1 Asuka Kazama 2 Christie Monteior 3 Ling Xiaoyu 4 Kazuya Mishima 5 Jin Kazama 6 King 7 Eddy Gordo 8 Nina Williams 9 Anna Williams 10 Devil Jin The only bad thing is Jinpachi Mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the DevilWithin mini game is ok Arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you ll be playing for hours on end later 
Good little and fun product Well the list of games is below so I m not going to go through it Having a Commodore 64 128 as a child I played these games in their day I have a console collection so I loved video games since I was a child How many levels and full games you could fit in just 64K of memory and 350K disks back then Anyway this collection has some of the most beloved games of that era at least the ones they could license for use on it The Epyx games were some of the best of their time games like Impossible Mission are fun to solve and finish and they are not that easy to solve either Jumpman the International Karate and the Epyx games will test your reflexes and abilities to perform exact moves and joystick commands to get higher scores I have fun playing with this little piece of gaming history games are not only about flashy graphics though they make a difference but how much fun you get from a game When I was a kid I used to dream of the days I could see graphics on games like the ones we see today These units can be hacked if you wish to take flash drives with more games change the game list or even add joysticks and keyboards but that s something you will have to search for and know how to do A few programmers and technicians who worked with Commodore computers back then found out how to do this and even provide instructions on how perform these modifications if you re skillful enough I really like this product and is part of my collection now the games are not emulated as the C64 motherboard was reengineered and shrunk to the size of a small chip so you re playing the games with 100 reproduction accuracy I wish I could give it the whole five stars but I ll give it four because the joystick could be a bit more responsive or perhaps like a user mentioned it could be that I have the first version and perhaps this was addressed on the new version Overall a great fun product 
for mod ers new package not version 2 This looked to be the new circuit board with flash ram and new modification options for the enthusiast The package was certainly new but the circuit board was the original version 1 You ll need to go to great lengths to make sure you re getting a version 2 if it s possible at all Good luck 
Good Collection of Commodore Games Even though my Commodore Joystick from Amazon didn t work I purchased it from other store and it s a good collection of Commodore 64 games for those who enjoy those 80 s days and nights waiting for the C 64 load games it will never be a complete collection because on C 64 we used to have hundred of them 5� Diskettes The graphics now looks rough comparing them to the current games however they did it with 64Kb only it s amazing how much they did with a little space 
Solution for too tight connectors I had similar difficulties with this hi def adapter For one thing the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets And once I did get them on all I got was a black screen But thanks to a friend I figured out what the problem was If you re having trouble getting those Monster cables attached and who hasn t you should get a DeoxIT ProGold Kit by Caig It s just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and more importantly act as a temporary lubricant I got my kit at Radio Shack I think it was about twelve bucks As for not getting any picture at all that was my fault I didn t realize that two of the sets of inputs on my TV are for 1080i only Once I moved the plugs to the proper jacks and turned off the signals that did not apply in my Xbox dashboard the picture was sharp and bright The cables are good quality My only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector It s kind of lame of Monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter Other than that if you ve got the cash get these cables and that Caig kit 
Why not get the best Monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video They cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping Saved 20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days I m happy 
OMG THIS PWNS 1337 UBER HAXXORZ in halo 2 if you make jump videos like me or like to make movies overall in halo 2 you can make the game hudless HUDLESS so you don t have to do the oddball trick any more and can keep jumping and filming with a clean result I hate cheaters and wish all of them could just be blown off of the face of the earth but making my games hudless is the the whole reason i m buying 
YOU DONT KNOW THE POWER As i read in other reveiws everybody here thinks this is a cheating program like gameshark But if you knew the true understand and wasn t an idiot who doesn t understand what PC stands for Action Replay lets you modify games and replay them on your xbox which now has come to be know as Soft Modding By downloading a special program just made for this xbox you are able to harness the power of modifying saves and even then create weapons maps and games into your xbox Which has come very handy in halo for me since I can now create maps into what i want allowing veihcles into maps where they cant be This is not a hundered percent chance of it working though if you have to many games saved on the xbox since its a large file when downloaded on for more information just type in Soft Modding and a ton of sites will come up 
works well Used this product to softmod my xbox Had to download an older version of the software though If you just use it to cheat in games probably not worth the money 
Question Can you use the Action Relpay on ur Xbox for multiplayergames like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo because that is the only reason why i want to use this product is so that i can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload i would want invinsibility but then it would be obvious that i was cheatin and when u read that u probablly thought well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo but still i would like to know this before i buy it i will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do 
Give this Monkey a Chance There seems to be schools of thought on this one Some are hard core fans of the old versions which I have never played and are extremely upset about the mini games being changed especially Monkey Target The other reviewers absolutely love the game for what it is a challenging experience that is destined to provide you with hours upon hours of enjoyment Lets start with the main game I LOVE how the Wiimote is used here It is INCREDIBLY sensitive and works perfectly with this type of game When you play through the first word eight levels and a boss you are taken to the credits When this happened for the first time I nearly freaked out and began to wonder who to sell the game to someone at not too big of a loss However once the credits were over I realized that you would have multiple worlds to choose from I m now midway through world six and they just get better and better There was a point when I was about ready to tear my hair out it was so challenging But once you beat a level you a psyched up and ready for another challenge This is the sign of a great game This game is worth buying for the one player mode alone This other part of the game is the now infamous multi player mode There are 50 games here FIFTY I agree with the other reviewers who say that not all maybe even most of the party games are now very well done The controls were obviously not perfected and I ll probably never play many of them again However there are some mini games that are wonderful My wife NEVER plays video games and LOVES these minis Some are very addicting My wife s younger brother spent the day with me today and we have a blast playing the minigames alone for over THREE HOURS and didn t even come close to playing them all Yeah some were letdowns but most were a lot of fun The best thing about the mini games are that they are so varied They really show what the new Wii controls are capable of In conclusion do not buy this game if you ONLY want to play Monkey Target But if you are looking for a super fun launch title that can be played played in both single and multi player form BUY IT NOW You will easily get your money s worth and its replay value is high Monkey Ball Rules 
Good I just got my Wii and I bought Zelda which was a given and I also purchased Monkey Ball because of the great reviews and rating The main game is very addicting and very challenging but I also thought Monkey Ball would be mainly great for mini games and I was wrong Although I did read that on the IGN review they said if they would have done 15 goood mini games instead of 50 it would have been smarter Overall the main game makes this game a worth while purchase while the mini game just adds a little feature so if you are buying this game for the sole purpose of mini games try Rayman And yes the controls are horrible on a lot of the mini games But I m still glad I got it me and my friend take turns playing the main game and it gets really challenging 
A Super Monkey Ball Banana Blast Ok so far the reviews have been really harsh on this game Some user gave the game a real cheap shot just because Monkey Target isn t as good as the Gamecube one Admittedly it isn t I loved and played the gamecube monkey target for hours but this one just isn t up to par Ok that s upsetting but it s easily overlooked The reason that s the case has to do with the fact that the rest of the game is amazing There are a few mini games that are a tad boring but most of them are a blast And then there is a large selection of mini games that are just as good as monkey target from gamecube and some And that is saying a heck of a lot The new controls make for a fresh and enjoyable experience whether in the main game or the mini game This is THE game to have if you want to see just what the Wii is capable of The controller is used in every which way to show just how fun this new control mechanism can be Oh and BTW if you want to see just how responsive and enjoyable a FPS can be on the Wii one of the mini games show you just that Don t listen to the harsh reviewers this is a keeper and a great game especially with other people to play it with In other words a Super Monkey Ball Banana Blast and it wouldn t be possible without the amazing system thanks Wii 
My New Favorite Game If somebody came up to you and said Here have some super powers what would you do Well The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction basically allows you to take the super powers and run rampant with them in just about any way you want While it doesn t contain the level of violence or crime that Grand Theft Auto has and lets face it that s what everyone will be comparing this game to it doesn t need to It also does not contain the depth of story that GTA is so good about But lets face it when you do and elbow drop onto someone s head from 50 stories up you can sacrifice some things to do that When you can hurl a tank into a helicopter and watch them both explode and almost be able to feel the impact of the explosion everything else just kind of fades into the background anyway I just beat the game a few days ago and I don t even remember the first few story missions because I spent so much time just running through the city smashing things and jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper thoroughly enjoying every second of it You can lose yourself in this game and play for hours without realizing it just like you can GTA but instead of getting frustrated at the game you actually feel a sense of relief each time you pound one of your opponents mercilessly into the ground and repeatedly stomp on thier heads let out a growl and kick them across the street Anger management has never felt so good 
Ultimate Fun Great tutorial and hands on learning This game is action packed with fight moves jumps combos etc My only complaint was Hulk s reaction time during running But that s easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff A definate buy 
WOW Hands down the best superhero game ever So many moves to acquire it will keep you playing for a long time Even after you finish it you ll want to go back just to destroy everything Good anger management that s for sure Note Don t bother playing the mini games to gain extra points There fun but useless You can acquire just as much if not more points just free roaming Plus you ll improve your fighting skills because the game gets harder as you go along 
Why do they only let u go up to 5 stars 5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is Light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NON STOP ACTION GAME 
Nice finish up to the trilogy INTRO Jak 3 is the ending to the Jak and Daxter trilogy and I have to say that it pulled it off quite nicely There are a few flaws in the game but nothing major You start out as Jak now an exile from Haven City because of people who distrust him and his dark powers He is taken in by the people of the Wasteland and the story continues from there GAMEPLAY Once again Jak moves very fluidly and nicely and has the exact same controls as the last game except for certain new powers like Light Jak And once again the animators have done a wonderful job of making lush detailed landscape and characters Sunsets and sunrises are done well and nothing looks cut and pasted on to the walls like Spyro era games I like the way that in this game you get to move between Haven City and the Wasteland This way you get even more terrain to explore than in the last game Additionally you get control of Light Jak powers I thought this was a nice twist and a nice way to add in something new for the people who enjoyed the Dark Jak option One thing that personally irks me they took away Keira s voice actor She barely speaks and when she does it s not the same person At least the other Keira had a role also the ending felt a little dragged out and towards the end of the game I was just hoping that it would finish soon instead of prolonging it with more crammed in missions PROS CONS Pros 1 Nice characters 2 No glitches so far 3 No loading times 4 Detailed landscape 5 New powers and old Dark Jak and Light Jak 6 Good switches between areas Cons 1 Blasting people or monsters over and over can get annoying 2 The ending seemed to go at the pace of a SNAIL OVERALL A nice finish to the series If you bought the first two you ll most definitely be drawn to this one anyway 
My brothers opinion This was a present for my brother so I don t know what it was like but he said it is the best 3rd person game on the x box 
My 2nd favorite star wars game of all time I m not a 1st 3rd person shooter fan But this game s graphics and sheer re playability won me over I actually played Battlefront II before I but the original seems much much better than the sequel P S Best star wars game ever X Wing Alliance What can I say I m old school 
Best Star Wars Game Ever by far Until Battlefront II This is a great game wow Be on any side you want play online choose where you play choose your type of soldier its all in your hands Xbox live great single player this is an amazing game I do watch all the star wars movies but im not a huge fan however this is still definitely one of the top 10 games ive ever played Dont even think about buying this game just buy it No matter if your a fan of star wars or not youll love it 
Convenient The best thing about this generation of consoles is the complete wireless experience The controllers are very well made and feel solid in your hands battery life is a solid 20 hours with the rechargeable batteries and they work from across the house I would recommend purchasing either the play and charge kit or the charging station to save you money on batteries 
Must have for Xbox 360 owners I am very hooked on this controller At first I thought the idea of a wire less controller was just more hassle but I m completely convinced now Mainly cause it stops my biggest fear from happening someone pulling my console down This didn t happen on the first Xbox because of the quick disconnect but it has happened quite a few times with my PS2 and i would die if my 360 fell Also this feels more like a remote now instead of just a game controller making it easy to go through your system in the dark and know your no gonna trip if you get up Finally I have owned almost every console from the NES and this is by far the best controller I have used Just buy it already 
wireless controller I m happy to have another wireless controller to use for co op and versus games 
I found only one problem with this controller The controller is excellent but for some reason the creator put four little knots on the controller joystick I have no ideal why but if you use this controller to play a fast paced game like boxing watch out because the tips of your thumb will hurt I am talking real pain It takes the fun out of the game you are playing I would give this controller a 5 star rating if it wasn t for the 4 knots on the joystick hopefully more people will complain and they will remove them This shows that the developers don t play the games long enough 
Finially a wireless controller without lag This is the first wireless controller that I have ever used that didn t LAG constantly In fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low The range is more than enough for any room in my home Actually I have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows Great product that I now have two of them and have retired the wired controller 
best controller this is one of the best controller I ever have grip felling and handeled are good as experience I recomende 
Wireless is perfect I just bought my 360 and ordered an extra wireless controller on another site cheaper with free shipping too and I love them so far They never lose connection and they are nice to hold No wires holding you down either My only gripe about these are that they don t come with a rechargable battery Why make a next generation system and have the state of the art wireless controllers run on AA s Ohh wait We can charge an extra 12 bucks to sell battery packs and another 30 for a recharging kit Other than that they are great I saved the money on the recharging cable and bought the recharging dock that comes with 1 battery pack and I bought 3 other battery packs so I d always have wireless with no wires Thats the way to go But SHAME ON YOU MICROSOFT 
A lot better than The Duke When ever I go to LAN Parties everyone there prefers this controller Theres only one person who used the bulky original Duke controller When he does it often dissconnects on him for no reason The S controller is a lot better in my perspective Its what I ve always used and what the majority of the population uses They should just call it the Xbox Controller without the S suffix 
the s controller the s controller is a auesome buy i have three and my big controller is horrible i let my dad use it and i always win but when he uses the s controller he wins so if u want to buy a controller the s controller is the very one to buy and if u only have two or one buy two or three 
Xbox Controller S This is a great controller Especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky Personally speaking I never really had problems with even that But since I got Xbox Controller S I havent touched the big one This controller gives a better grip buttons are softer and their positioning is better the overall feel is quite good I played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game Even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully master the tracks I did it without any problems using this controller Also the vibration feel is very good So if you are looking to buy an Xbox controller and are not being able to decide which just go for this smaller one Controller S without any hesitation Quality hardware 
Best Controller Yet This controller is great You are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest This controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus 
new vs old simply put this is a great product if it doesnt work with your ps2 its because you have an old one that doesnt make this a bad product i own own and a slim ps2 and it works just fine better than all the reviews i ve seen claim 
PS2 DVD Remote by Sony This is an exceptional value Plug in the reciever and wa la Use the remote Personal experience says it can be used to play some games even 
It is not a false advertisement It is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the Playstation 2 that have a built in IR receiver which is why it doesn t include it 
it plays vidoes and music also for those who are deciding to buy a psp becasue it has the ability to play movies and music The DS can also do this too with a attachment that accpets compact flah cards that you can load your media on it from your computer and play it on your d 
advance cable The Nintendo GC GB Advance Cable adds some new features to some of its systems most popular games Although I do not own every game this item enhances I do own a few From what I have played Animal Crossing Pokemon Harvest Moon ect this product has provided just a little more fun Although it is not a gaming essential die hard Nintendo fans of both the portable and non portable systems will definitely want to buy this item and explore new options provided by the cable 
Very good It s a very good product but it only can be shipped within U S so I can t buy i 
its a must you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub 
Ok but not great I went the bargain route and I got what I paid for It works fine but it looks cheap sitting next to my high end receiver remote I ended up using my wireless controller for movie playback 
Does the trick I ve had DVD players come and go so its kinda cool to have a gaming console that plays dvd s too Yeah I know the PS2 has that capability without a remote I have one of those too But one of the cool things I noticed about the X Box playback kit is that the remote looks just like the ones made by RCA I tried a few of the controls on the DVD funtion of my RCA universal remote low and behold it worked Kinda a hand thing I ve got to many remotes floting around as it is so that part was nice Mine works great I use it instead of having to re arrange my already overpacked entertainment center to put in my other DVD player 
1 Best Game on the Wii Launch Except Zelda Call of Duty is the best game that you can get for the Wii with its launch titles Except for Zelda TP of course The story line is incredibly well developed as you lead the ally forces in their liberation of France The game utilizes all aspects of the systems capabilities as you use the unique motion sensing capabilities to drive a jeep plant charges aim a mortor and even fire your own weapon The graphics are not quite comparable to those of the PS3 s or the 360 s but it never becomes an issure This game is incredibly fun and I would strongly reccomend it anyone 
great but no online I beat the german in the room on the first try 
A little old school with a little new Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES with the first Mario RPG Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars a game I absolutely love and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator The reason is the general gameplay for this RPG hasn t changed You move around different screens attack the enemies fight bosses etc There is definately a unique and I suppose you might consider it simplistic ideology that this game follows It s an easier version of action RPGs you level up battles aren t random you can see the enemies you engage on screen though it is turn based This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it it s own game I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn t mind a lot of chatting but even more action and puzzles Another homerun for Mario RPGs 
Good times with old friends I love this game Once I started playing I couldn t stop My DS battery is dead after like 3 days I play so much Once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing You get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time The controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into So lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there Mario greatness 
Dino stalker will rock Dino Stalker will rock It should be on the XBOX becouse its graphics are so good 
A Must Have For Fans There is no denying that Star Wars Battlefront is one of the best video game series that is currently available The first game was really amazing let us participate in some of the places seen in all six movies But even though the game was really fun it felt like there was something still missing The missing piece was put in and this is the result This is not a disappoinment but the best Unlike the first game when the main story gameplay was just caputring bases and killing all of the enemy forces here there are actually missions to complete From having to retrieve data discs to killing rebel leaders this game is more indepth than it s predecessor In game there are still times when bases have to be captured like in the first game but you no longer have to kill all of the enemies The coolest part of the game is that you get to ride in different ships and other things from the movies Lots of fun So overall this game really is an improvement over the first but some may prefer the first more The reason being that the first game is basically kill everyone and take their bases and that is less seen here with the focus is more on protecting things and stealing things 
StarWars Battlefront II warning very addictive This is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title When you re flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms you begin to realize this game is really special 
WOW Greatest Star Wars Game Ever Period I got this game the day it came out and I still can t stop playing it This game has everything that the original one didn t The new levels are awesome and the heroes are great Oh and it helps that the heroes aren t immortal anymore like in Battlefront 1 Unfortunately some of the best levels from 1 are missing in 2 such as Bespin and Tatooine But if you have xbox live you can get them + 2 heroes for just 4 99 A MUST HAVE FOR ALL STAR WARS FANS AND GAMERS ALIKE 
One of the BEST GAMES EVER This game is really good Theres a wide varity of lvls to play and a very good multyplayer system The game only has a few faults like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship The game also gets a little boring after a while Besides that its a great game 
Fun but BROKEN I bought this game on a whim I am not a Spyro fan For the first few hours I found it quite enjoyable It had colorful graphics cool moves and even some humorous aspects Unfortuneately it is UNBELIEVABLY frustrating I m quite skilled with platformers but this game required perfect timing accuracy etc All this led to a lot of anger on my part Still I might have managed to work through it if it hadn t BROKE Yes that s right when I tried to turn it on again the XBox refused to read my saved file And I must admit I had no desire to start over Eventually I sold this game and my XBox Sorry Vivendi sorry Bill Gates You ll both have to come up with something less faulty next time 
Really cool gam You get to be different animals It is a really cool game I recommend it to other kids to buy The cheetah get shoot bow and arrows 
Improvements to Spyro I got this for X mas and I am a huge Spyro fan I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games and the second on Playstation 2 The last one Enter the Dragonfly wasn t SO successful and I feared there wouldn t be another but here it is And SO many things have been added Buying items at item shops keychains for keys to open boxes riding around in the professors new gadget ball mini games featuring not Spyro but his friends etc i kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race but This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don t have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole etc as he moves along and he even meets little dragons like him Ember Flame Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge but it never seems overwhelming Some of the mini game s second levels are a pain but you can come back later The strategy guide is also helpful This time I don t think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn t evolved or that it s the same old thing but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels He s Spyro Hours of enjoyment 
I thought there could be more I thought that there could have been more to some of the story line I v been playing GTA Vice City San Andreais and like the stoury line But overall I was pleased with the game 
This IS a Classic I ve owned this game since 3 weeks after it first came out and I have nothing but praise for this masterpiece of a game After two equally as amazing sequels that feature so much more than GTA 3 one would think that my opinion of this game has diminished but it hasn t I still remember playing this game for the first time I d just sit in my room for hours staring with my mouth hanging open just taken back by everything such as the very fun missions the enormous environment or the fact I could just run around and do whatever I wanted WHENEVER I wanted Another fabulous part of this game is the radio Surprisingly alot of these songs are actually good I ve never heard of any of the people who sing them but stations like Head radio and Flashback feature some surprisingly catchy tracks that add an additional lightness to this already darkly humorous game However Chatterbox is probably the best which features a ton of dry sarcastic and often hilarious humour For such an enormous environment one would have to give the graphics a bit of recognition Obviously their not perfect and there are many games with MUCH better graphics than this game but these graphics are still pretty damn good The cars look really awesome and all the characters including the pedestrians are surprisingly well detailed However the main thing about this game is that its fun ALOT of fun There is so much more that you can do rather than just missions You can do a variety of sub missions which include becoming a taxi driver a law enforcer an ambulance driver and even a firefighter all of which allow you to earn a bit of money The guns are also really cool and you can have alot of fun with them especially weapons like the grenades and rocket launcher Another thing to note is that this particular game has ALOT of glitches but they aren t evident For example at the beginning of the game you see yourself robbing a bank in an unidentified part of some city Well later on if you manage to figure out the irritating Dodo plane that s right there is a flyable plane you can actually find that section of city Overall this is one of the best games for Playstation 2 Pretty much any person who isn t jaded when it comes to video games and just wants to have alot fun for a very long time should buy this game There isn t much of a story but who cares This game KICKS ASS and any gamer should buy this Don t rent this game just go and buy it RIGHT NOW You won t regret it I promise One thing to note however is that it is very violent and there is a fair bit of cursing You can also solicit prostitutes and if you drive to a quiet place your car will start bouncing just so the parents know With that in mind the game still kicks alot of ass 
Review in retrospect Several years and several sequels have passed now so is GTA III really worth the time I d definitely say so This game continues to be incredibly fun years later You can pick it up and just have a play or you can advance through the stories Each is engaging and creative just like the sequels When it comes down to it this is a great game and it still holds its weight against the sequels and the knock off games It s a definite buy 
AND 1 Streetball Great game made by basketball fans for basketball nuts Like how easy is to alley oop to self and player It s fast and responsive I had no problem with my copy on the slim PS2 as reported Most be a bad PS2 that kid has 
Charging The DS Lite The success of the Nintendo DS Lite brought out so many new gamers to a whole new generation of handheld gamers Yet for those who purchased the original DS any of those have a set AC adapter to call their own However for the newer editions you d have to tackle a different way to plug in and charge up your Nintendo DS system Well this DS Lite AC Adapter from Nintendo is very convient and easy to install Although there is one disadvantage with this AC Adapter With this one you unfortunately can t use this with the original Nintendo DS Still if you had to choose a adapter to charge up your Nintendo DS I really recommend one from Nintendo over another company Price A Convience A Overall 
energetic My kids 11 and 7 2nd and 6th graders first played this game at a friend s house They both begged for it They have not stopped playing with it The thing is that we live in Texas and sometimes it is just way too hot to play outside There are always news reports about kids just sitting around This game makes you MOVE They played so hard the first day that they got it that they were both so sore the next day I recommend this toy for several people First if you need to get your kid moving this is great If you have hyper children that need an outlet this is great If you need to exercise more this is great If the weather doesn t permit your active kid to go outsice this toy is great If your kid wants to see him or herself on TV this is great If your kid is afraid to try new things in front of others this is great This toy got my boy to sign up for little league Both of my kids are already active so they play hard but it is an irresistable temptation for even inactive kids Everyone in the neighborhood loves it 
Great fun My son 11 years old and I have played this together and had a blast It is fun to watch him play alone too When his cousins come over they all take turns playing together and seem to really like it Great fun for rainy days 
Eye Toy Gets you moving With a hot summer I found my kids 7 10 playing more and more video games we purchased the eye toy and they had a blast getting up and moving the interaction was alot of fun 
Hidden Gem First off the eyetoy is a great game peripheral Next it s getting some new games as well as it will be useable on the next gen console PS3 Third it is usable as a webcam on the pc In fact it is a fantastic webcam Only you need to download a inf a driver for the webcam There s tutorials out there Google it 
GREAT GAME Horrible service Amazon For Christmas I bought this item for my child who is very into the likes of this product I thought What s cooler than having a video game AND a workout So me being a very loyal Amazon fan who buys everything from Amazon decided to purchase it It arrived on time My child was VERY thrilled to play it To my whole family s dissapointment the EYE TOY CAMERA that was sent with the game was apparently broken Ok Amazon I would rather you keep your Eye Toy Camera that s broken until you can send us the whole package that actually works Later my whole family played this game at the neighbors house Extremely fun when the camera actually works Replacement camera should be here soon Very furious at Amazon 
Just a me too review I just grabbed a DS yesterday and this is my first game for it Square has really done an amazing job remaking the Famicom classic For the first couple seconds I was put off by the pixelated fmv opening scenes but I was soon overtaken by the style with which they were executed Aside from the obvious audio visual updates the gameplay has really been well adapted to the DS To me the game is actually far more fun to play with the stylus than with the d pad Others have mentioned that the game may be to challenging for some However it really isn t that bad The keys are to fight with intuition and pay attention to what townspeople tell you For instance near the beginning of the game you must venture into a cave filled with undead monsters They will seriously whip your arse before you have 100 hp or so UNLESS you realize that you can cast cure on them and they will all die in one round a villager from a nearby area mentions this fact Then you get a bunch of experience and gain several levels quickly and the cave becomes quite easy to complete This type of strategy helps keep the game moving smoothly You just have to know that repeatedly pressing the A button or tapping the screen during battles won t cut it the way it does with some RPGs Happy gaming 
I cannot put this one down The first thing that hits you is the video sequences The introduction videos play in amazing detail on both screens The game features the typical battle control that you would expect from Square Additionally I am pleased to report that all game functions can be controlled without the use of a stylus If you need something to pass the time this holiday season and beyond pick up this game Note After purchasing the game I just wanted to post a quick review backing up everyone else s opinion Thanks Amazon Pros 1 Soundtrack A joy to listen to 2 Graphics The most detailed graphics I have seen on the DS since release 3 Challenging Forget about finishing this title in ten hours If you move to fast through the game you will die Cons 1 Challenging Some may find this unfair 
This fantasy s still a classic Final Fantasy is a series that s almost as familiar to casual and hardcore gamers as Mario and Zelda yet the franchise has been incomplete in America for 16 years Well that was the case until November 15th rolled around and Nintendo DS owners were treated to the first ever American version of Final Fantasy III Originally a 1990 NES game that has long since been a mystery to those who didn t illegally download ROMs or import the game Final Fantasy III is a great game that has aged quite well and makes a great appearance on the Nintendo DS The story is pretty bare for 2006 standards but thinking of the classic style of the game it is quite above other games of its time The story revolves around Luneth a boy from the dark world who forms a team with three other individuals destined to be the Warriors Of The Light These Warriors are prophesied to save the world from darkness and protect the four precious powerful crystals that maintain balance and peace Luneth and Co Arc Refia and Ingus set out to set everything in the world straight Today we sit and think How generic Back then though it was as popular of an idea as playing a rhythm based game with a guitar controller Let s get one thing straight this game s dated in a lot of ways If you ve played the PlayStation or Game Boy Advance remakes of Final Fantasy I II you ve got an idea about how the pacing battle system and overall flow of the classic RPG goes It s much different than SquareEnix s other recent RPG of the same franchise Final Fantasy XII which feels completely different without considering its gameplay and battle system alterations Final Fantasy III isn t an easy game It doesn t really hold your hand at any point and it ll ruthlessly punish those unfortunate gamers who tread off of the suggested path Still it s got that classic hook a hook that s almost impossible to describe but even harder to avoid once it s snagged you Final Fantasy III keeps the four person party standard of its two original predecessors and also has the traditional turn based battle system The result is a system that forces you to really think about your actions each turn because the enemy is going to attack no matter what their agility or speed parameters are If Refia s running low on HP and you suspect a possible group attack by a boss character it would be wise to cast a healing spell and maybe even prepare a Phoenix Down It would have been nice to see SquareEnix adapt the Active Time Battle system of Final Fantasy VI VII and so on but what s here works well anyway The MP system is quite dated and instead of having a set amount each level of magic has its own number of points Using a level one black magic spell like Fire will take one point away from your level one magic points while a level three one like Fira takes away one level three magic point No matter what spell you use it takes away a single point I don t like this system much because it doesn t give much importance or power to each spell For example level three white magic spells Cura and Teleport are given the same point value which doesn t make sense when Cura will be used at least fifty times as often as Teleport throughout the game This seems to be a good place to mention the menu system which is also quite dated and sometimes not as easy to use as newer entries Because of the dated MP system there are numbers all over the place and it seems a little sloppy The new story here is the job system Surely if you ve been to a gaming Internet page or read a gaming magazine in the last few months you ve seen the Final Fantasy III ads that state that it offers 279 841 unique party combinations with four characters and 23 different jobs If you don t believe it grab your nearest graphing calculator and figure up the equation for factorials From the beginning every character possesses the neutral and undeveloped Freelancer job As you find and interact with more of the powerful crystals throughout the storyline you ll unlock more jobs and develop your party even further You can be a Warrior Thief Monk Black Red or White Mage early in the game and eventually you ll unlock jobs like Geomancer Dark Knight Dragoon Summoner and Ninja Once you choose a job you can power it up by increasing its job level a value unique to each job for each individual character For example it s possible for Luneth to be a Level 15 Freelancer Level 25 Warrior and Level 30 Dark Knight before the end of the game These levels of course are separate from the character s base level which as always increases with experience points earned in random battles and boosts your general stats More than anything Final Fantasy III is a good way to introduce a foreign chapter of the series to long term players and series veterans I wasn t surprised when after a 30 minute trek through a cave I was killed in two turns by a boss character and forced to tread that long path all over again It s unfortunate that so much backtracking is required but even after dying a second time to the same boss using the same annoying attack I picked the game back up I trudged through it despite my bitterness and enjoyed every second of it Classic RPGs like Final Fantasy III didn t introduce save points or crystals that are found in later games the only save point is the overworld map Here the game can be saved from any point Another big challenge comes when status changing magic wreaks havoc on your party Unlike recent RPGs where negative status is often eliminated after battle almost every single status ailment in Final Fantasy III remains afterward Poison paralysis confusion frog all of these familiar effects will be a lot more familiar by the time players see ending credits Unseasoned RPG players will probably be quite frustrated and know that every time you see an enemy use the attack Bad Breath you re in for quite a lot of trouble Final Fantasy III is one of the best looking DS games to date SquareEnix introduced a visual style that s reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles As a result the game is very colorful and detailed Spell effects are as impressive as one could expect from the DS and trump those of some console games The boss and monster models are fun to look at and defeat I would have liked to see some more animation during battle rather than running up and attacking enemies like in Final Fantasy X characters stand in place and swing their weapons in classic RPG style It would have been really nice to see SquareEnix go those extra two miles they already went one by reworking the graphics but what s done here is great The music seems to be standard RPG fare and I m not totally sure whether or not the tunes are high quality rips from classic NES MIDI but what s here sounds pretty nice At least there s that unforgettable nine note victory tune that ll always get a smile out of a Final Fantasy fan Final Fantasy III serves its purpose by introducing an unknown chapter to fans and doing so in a very respectable fashion There are things that could have been better sure SquareEnix could have put a little more time in modernizing the battle system animation menus and save system That would have put two cherries on top of a sweet tasty treat Even with all of these little kinks Final Fantasy III is great It s got that classic replay value It s got that punishing challenge that will appeal to fans of older games It s got production values that are topped only by SquareEnix s other DS game Mario Hoops 3 On 3 The end all to end all it s a well done Final Fantasy game It s one of the best handheld RPGs in a long time and needs to be in a DS owner s collection 
Final Fantasy III Old School but well worth it I honestly don t see why Square Enix hasn t thought of doing this to all their older Final Fantasy games really It would definitely appeal to the newer Final Fantasy audiences who s grownup on all the 3 D games all the while giving them a good history lesson on the FF games yet appeal to us older Final Fantasy fans with its old school style I liked it better when the stories were simpler to follow That s not to say I dislike the newer Final Fantasy games though Things change through the years as do I and I love those games just as much The game starts off with you Luneth assembling a team of heroes Arc Refia and Ingus to restore balance to the world To do this you must choose jobs 23 in all to help aid you in your quest Every battle you play through will add to each of the character s job level so you ll want to use thought in building not only your characters main level but also their job proficiency as well Although Final Fantasy III is a Very challenging game it s also an entertaining one I wish the Nintendo DS had more RPGs done in this style I simply couldn t get enough of the game and kept on finding myself fighting one more battle whatnot before putting it down You ll explore the lands man a boat pilot an airship ride a chocobo find treasure and more Not only that but the game is simply beautiful I agree it s simply a better overall experience in 3 D All in all you re looking at an RPG that clocks in around the 50 60 hour mark depending on how you play With new side quests and moogle mail you ll have a bit more to play Final Fantasy III is a DS gem that shouldn t be missed 
great game well i ve played this for a few hours since it just came yesterday but i m already very impressed the graphics are incredible i didn t think the ds was capable of such pretty 3 d with zoom graphics there are 23 different job classes in the game ex white wizard knight sage etc which fans of final fantasy tactics will recognize being able to shift jobs and work towards more powerful ones melds the best of rpg and tactics in other words crazy awesome good will probably be the handheld game of the year and will probably be the biggest rpg of the christmas season 
Lemony Snicket A Series of Fortunate Family Game Events Lemony the game is not for hardcore gamers It doesn t aspire to be It shouldn t be compared to Warcraft or Resident Evil 4 The game was developed by AMAZE for Activision Any one familiar with the first three Harry Potter Movie co ordinated games through Electronic Arts EA Games is familiar with Amaze The first three Potter games were fun and a bit of challenge for children and for those adults who were new to PC gaming The player wandered around the magical world of Hogwarts collecting jelly beans and wizard cards What was fun was not completeing the tasks or learning new magic what was fun was the freedom to discover new areas and find secret places Fans of the Potter games will recognize the same mechanics of gameplay outfitted in a new location jelly beans are replaced with golden eyes golden hearts refuel stamina instead of chocolate frogs playbills and letters are granted instead of wizard cards Players will also recognize the flavor of wonderful score the game is set to enjoyable appropiate but not overbearing with some familiar notes Lemony isn t quite as good as the aforementioned Potter games The reason being Lemony is not a fun story While ficticious Lemony is a story of the relentless abuse of three very droll and very wealthy orphans Its much more fun to play as a boy who has left his abusive Aunt and Uncle behind entering a magical world to be educated at Hogwarts I rather enjoyed learning to how to fly Buckbeak in Prizoner of Azkaban In Lemony I m rather relieved I solved the train signal puzzle the thought of having children run over and over and over by a train until I did was depressing me Yet Lemony will provide some consolation to those who have been disappointed by EA s latest Potter offering The Goblet of Fire While there is an adjustment to the droll circumstances the task of discovering your world will take over and the game will eventually command your attention While Lemony isn t bad it isn t that good either They renderings of the children are not the most flattering they could be and the villians are boorishly ugly The gameplay controls aren t half as good as the Potter games and they weren t the greatest There s a match game puzzle in a cellar that only shows up per every install instead of every game I did complete it and nothing happened on my game which maybe the reason the puzzle won t show up in the rest of the games in a particular installation It has done this twice on me and I m not going to uninstall and install a third time to see if it happens again It had no effect on my score or letter or eye collecting The camera angles aren t well mapped for shooting I was supposed to shoot a rat but the camera got behind a ceiling lamp and while the rat was biting me all I could see was the inside of a lamp shade Suff like that Still its better than most children s games out there and it plays As you may have guessed there is violence When I shoot a rat in Lemony it is shot with a rotten egg lobber Rotten eggs are your bullets and the player stuns the enemies instead of killing them About time I ve played Lemony three times the third time it was going through the motions Once the few skills of jumping aiming the egg lobber and the boot puncher had been mastered there wasn t any interest left But for the time I did play I did enjoy it The games by AMAZE are a category unto themselves They are not action games based on a trigger finger nor are they the point click boring adventure games beset with brain teaser puzzles in a futuristic world They are a relaxing time where you don t have to test your brain just delight it If you have never played the Potter games and are new to PC gaming I recommend Lemony it is a good place to start If you are a fellow Potterhead and felt betrayed buy Goblet of Fire Lemony will sustain you 
Freaking Cool Videogame as Art WOW This game is so freaking cool The colossi are amazing I ve played my share of games and I can honestly say that I ve never encountered creatures like these before I m only about halfway thru the game having slain 7 colossi with 9 more yet to go and yet each new colossus that I meet astounds me all over again One thing about them that I have never felt in other games is that they envoke sympathy towards them Until you find them in their own little area of their world they are just giant hulks resting peacefully bothering no one But once disturbed they awaken and you must figure out how to take each one down I actually feel sad when they fall Supposedly your character must take them down to resurrect his lifeless lover however I get a sense that there will be a twist to this story before it ends Another equally awe inspiring aspect of this game is the environment in which you are playing It is without compare the most beautiful mystical unbelievably gorgeous landscape I ve seen in any game ever The world looks feels and sounds like an ancient place and time You just have to experience it This will be one of those games I ll remember years from today and will have to play all over again This game is a work of art just as certain films are plus it s just so freaking cool Don t miss it 
Time well spent I have played this game up through the 6th Colossus The game just keeps drawing me in I want to see the next colossus find out what happens next As other reviewers have said these colossi are ENOURMOUS Finding out how to kill them can be a challange but the game will give you hints if you get stuck I can t say it s a terribly difficult game but for me spending TONS of time to figure out how to advance in a game is a turn off Definately worth buying 
Great Unusual Game I ve played lots of different genres of games and this one is difficult to classify other than it s a great game Most games cycle through my library but this one s a keeper The control is simple and natural the gameplay is hypnotizing and the music is perfect Hopefully there s a Shadow of the Colossus 2 in the works 
Shadow of the Colossus I rarely rate or write reviews about video games CDs or movies but I feel that this game deserves all the props it can get Honestly when I first saw an ad for it I thought it looked interesting but none of my friends or family had heard of it so I was reluctant to buy at first However my roomate and I decided to buy this game and play it through together and it ended up being even better than my favorite Final Fantasy video game series SotC has a unique story line decent music but most of all the most beautiful and innovative gameplay I have encountered The idea of just fighting giant creatures throughout a free roaming world is amazing being able to climb up them and use the terrain to the best of your advantage Having no trash mobs between each colossus was a relief too because I feel as though it would have made the game more cliche and unenjoyable I could talk all day about this but for the sake of listening to me rant go buy this gam 
Fun game don t have all the time in the world I love this game for what it is You cannot expect this to be anything like Madden but it is still a fun game Injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced Fast Paced something I cannot say about the loading This game is the slowest loading game I have ever played It actually took three minutes for it to load one time Get this game provided that you can wait a little bit 
Good Football Game This is an unorthodox football game This is not an NFL game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league There are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom Beat the Division 3 level move up to 2 Beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game As you move up you also unlock rewards If you re tired of Madden s franchise mode give this game a try It won t get outdated just because of NFL free agency 
Blitz the League LOAD TIME be prepaired to wait Other then that it s a fun game that keeps you playing 
The real NFL Let me begin by saying this is NOT a game for children What makes this game unique and separates it from the Madden series is the training camp option Train your players use steroids and x ray those bone crushing injuries Overall a pretty good sports game 
The Dark Side Of Football For Anyone Who Loves Football And Everything About It Knows Their Is Also A Dark Side Of The Game Where Players Take Illegal Drugs To Help Out Their Game Where Owners Will Do Anything For Their Team To Win This Game Is Alot Like Any Given Sunday Remember Win At Any Cos 
Good Deal for the money I ve had this headset for about a month and a half and so far things have been working good It is a little staticky but for the price of 25 bucks you cant really go wrong If it comes down to a little static or being restricted by a lame cord then I d rather endure a little static The battery life is probaly a little over 4 hrs which is pretty good for the size of the unit The miscomfort that the other reviewers wrote about isnt really as bad as they ve made it sound Once again it is a LITTLE unconfortable for a long length of time 3 hrs + or maybe a little less for others but I dont think I ve worn any kind of ear piece that was very comfortable regardless of what it was designed for cell phone xbox ect One thing to keep in mind before you purchase manufacture is Logitech so I felt good about the reliability of the product Tacoma W 
Best at multiplayer mode Being an easy game in championship mode the best is when played in multiplayer mode Hours and hours of fun playing against friends and family A must have 
Keeps Grown Men Busy I play this with my friends We are all grown men We re so pathetic but we don t care When we play we randomize our characters and cars It really makes the game interesting It totally sucks when you get stuck with some losers like Wario and Petey Piranha All Wario does is throw that lame bomb that never hits anyone and Petey Piranha s head is so big that you can t see the road in front of you I prefer Donkey Kong and Toadstool If those two characters ever come up for me the game is over dude Usually I m the champ but the last time we played Ron won But we ll see who takes it next time Anyways go get this game You ll get your money s worth and then some 
good i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin 
A solid continuation from vice city until GTA 4 comes out This game is way more like vice city than san andreas so anyone expecting to see a character who has to eat go to the gym and etc will be disappointed San Andreas was a revolution in the history of all gaming this is a solid game too but minus the revolution You get all the fun of vice city basically which means cop bribing law breaking pedestrian harming havoc The sad fact is you can not climb swim or fly and there is no jetpack D oh The graphics are poor and the storyline is not as good as I would hope but remember this is a psp port It is also only 20 bucks so give it a try if you liked vice city a lot then you will like this one 
Entertaining Yet Fairly Easy 4 Stars There isn t a whole lot I can add to the other reviews but I disagree when some say that this game is challenging I bought this game about a week ago and I ve already beaten it No guide no internet walkthroughs no cheats Honestly that s never been the case for me with ANY GTA game that I ve played Heck I m still trying to beat San Andreas I play straight up with no cheats or guides helpers and I ve had that game for over a year now The ending is kind of cheesy too but it s still a good game and makes for a great pacifier until the next GTA comes out And at 20 you can t really go wrong anyway 
The same game as GTA 3 Your back in liberty City just like GTA 3 you cant fly swim clime just like GTA 3 No graphics upgrade No airplanes Glitches like crazy Same as PSP But if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong 
Much less the same much less the same fun The Grand Theft Auto series and the PlayStation 2 have gone hand in hand which each game debuting on the PS2 before it travels to other consoles That all changed with the release of last year s side story Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories This game designed to take advantage of the PSP s hardware was an impressive technical feat managing to pack in a lot of what made the big GTA games so memorable But it fell short in a few key spots most notably the story the characters and the series biting sense of style and satire That stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry Liberty City around in your back pocket But on the PS2 where you can compare it directly to the three Grand Theft Auto games that have appeared there the whole package is significantly less interesting even considering the PS2 port s budget price Not much has changed so if you ve already played this on the PSP there s not much reason to take on the PS2 version The game s got a slightly longer draw distance on the PlayStation 2 and the streets look like they might have a few more people on them But neither of these things dramatically changes the game and they can t save the game s otherwise murky visuals and often poor frame rate But it also controls a little better with the right analog stick back in effect you ve got all the camera control and other buttons you re used to hitting on the PS2 It s neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy but if you didn t play it on the PSP Liberty City Stories 20 price tag is just right Just don t go in expecting anything approaching the grandiose nature of GTAIII let alone the bigger crazier Vice City or San Andreas And if you ve already played it on the PSP well there s little reason to play it again because this is the same game with the multiplayer modes stripped out As a return to Liberty City the New York themed locale first made famous back in Grand Theft Auto III Liberty City Stories is all about retreading through well worn territory If you still remember the streets of Liberty City you ll see plenty of the same spots here But as a game that was designed for the less powerful PSP you ll probably notice that Liberty City Stories is much smaller in scope than what we ve seen in the series more recently Missions which grew to epic proportions in San Andreas are much shorter and feel pretty meaningless in LCS There are plenty of moments where you ll complete a mission and immediately think Well at least I ll never have to do that again The story however is the biggest casualty Liberty City Stories tells the tale of one Toni Cipriani a regular type mob guy who did a good deed for the head of the Leone crime family Salvatore Leone Toni had to go away for awhile but the heat s died down and he s back on the job in Liberty City maintaining his loyalty to Sal while wiping out the family s enemies in droves along the way As you ascend to become Salvatore s right hand man you ll start and finish gang wars with other mafia types a few triads the yakuza pretty much all of the usual suspects are present If you re familiar with the various mafia presences over the course of the past three GTA games you ll recognize a few of the names and faces here But the story stands alone and doesn t require you to remember the various cast members That s a good thing because the mafia characters in the other GTA games have been largely forgettable The game s storyline really isn t up to par with the console installments in the series because very little actually happens Even potential plot points are squandered like when Toni finally becomes a made man but a bad cutscene doesn t actually show the ceremony The game s mission path doesn t deviate into crazy territory and most of the characters are fairly lifeless There are no enigmatic weirdos like Truth the crazy hippie from San Andreas or Steve Scott the porno director from Vice City to break up the heavier handed mafia tasks This dulls the game s personality preventing its characters and events from becoming as memorable as we ve come to expect from GTA games and their excellent storylines 
Beautiful Graphics And Deep Gameplay There is so much to see and discover in this game It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena Someone who wanted to complete all side quests find all special items etc could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored just incredibly deep gameplay The graphics are also outstanding among the best I have seen in a video game It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters stats At first I didn t find it as satisfying as the typical method of leveling up But eventually I began to enjoy it and it s now one of my favorite aspects of the game The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were The storyline itself was quite good But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game Definitely worth buying 
Pure Magic All I have to say is that squaresoft out did themselves with X It truly is a masterpiece and a feast for the eyes I was lost in it s story creativity music and charcters Beautiful 
Final Fantasy has done it again I m not going into the storyline becuase it will obivously spoil it for those who haven t had the oppurtunity to play this excellent game Final Fantasy X is the first game in the Final Fantasy Series to be released on the playstation 2 The graphics here are sharp and crisp no fuzzness or distortions Voice actors actually do a good job doesn t sound like those old kung fu movies where the tone of the voices don t match the person s appearnace Battle system is simple to use and they offer tutorials within the menu in case you re still confused I m really pleased with the results and I can see myself playing this game over and over again 
The best Need for Speed yet This is definitely a game for racing fans and people who love tuning cars In this game they actually have the exotic cars Porsche Lamborghini which makes it even better They also added cops in this game which they never had in the previous Underground games Now to the game In this game there are alot of cars You can race from the old school muscle cars to a tuned up race car And even the police have nice and fast cars But they can be really tough at times especially the SUVs The Storymode actually kept my interest throughout the whole game unlike the others that were quite boring There is a Blacklist that you must beat in order to become the 1 most wanted In this Blacklist there are 15 experienced Street racers that you must beat in order to get to the top They each have their strengths so it can get quite challenging at times Another cool but at the same time annoying thing is when the cops interfere in the middle of a race and once you beat the race you have to escape them So it s very interesting and fun As for the gameplay it s actually easy to get used to even though it may seem difficult It s also not complicated PS2 version it s mainly like the previous Need for Speeds So you ll learn it like after the first race The graphics are one of the things that caught my attention It s just so smooth and seems real And the videos also seem very realistic and are always fun to watch and can be funny when you get busted by a woman Overall there s not much else to say except go out and buy this game if you love racing games Oh yes and buy the Black edition 
Need for Speed Most Wanted I have been enjoying playing this game Once you get used to the speed brake and the nos button your on your way to mastering this game This defenitly beats Need for Speed2 Hot Persuit 1 I think the game could be better if they had us race at night through the city streets with the buildings aglow like New York or Las Vegas in a couple of the races 2 I am getting my cars pretty fast as I try to win the game my last wish for this game was to bad the roads have to end before you can really see how fast your car can go whether your racing or on free time I always seem to have stop or brake sooner than I d like to as the road curves as the race track keeps going along I am having fun with the game anyways The milestones requirements give the game a nice touch as it adds more fun to the game as you try to accomplish the task and avoid getting your car impounded Good game M O 
Great fun Make sure to play it with Force Feedback Wheel I have played many of the NFS series This one and NFS Hot Pursuit 2 are the best To me this game would not be very playable with a regular gamepad I purchased the Logitech Force Feedback Pro wheel and it makes ALL the difference Precise control The game takes on a whole new level of realism You get a much better feel for how the different cars react The game does get progressively harder Getting on the Blacklist is easy getting to number 1 is not Some of the milestones can be ridiculously hard but it is awesome when you finally get past them I do wish I had bought the Black Edition but the regular one was good for hours and hours of fun I would say there is a decent level of replay ability to it too 
Pretty good It s just like the cartoon series My brother 7 yrs old can play this game for hours I play it 18 yrs old and find it enjoyable It gives you something to do on those slow days There are mini missions you have to complete You re given awards and extras to the game after each completion I d say it s 100 hours to complete the whole game I ve done 60 in one day but that could just be me I normally devour any game I get The graphics is great the story is great it s amusing a little too colorful but you get used it 
I m More ED cited This is a really nice game no matter which system you get it for especially if you re a huge fan of the show like me First off this features impressive gameplay with awesome 3 D graphics Heck they ve still got the squiggly outlines right even in 3 D form Next there are some great special features with no needed codes like a feature with the cast members who do the voices of the Eds and the Plank music video You can garner these cool extras by finding chickens in each level Now in this game you play all three Eds in their neverending hijinks for jawbreakers In fact you can find jawbreakers if look real hard in each level There s even a jawbreaker dispenser somewhere in the game but you got to have a certain amount of cash on hand to get them Playing all three of the Ed characters can be tough but quite fun in a way As Ed the one with the eyebrow you can pick up objects and throw them and using the Batter Ed move to smash through walls and stuff As Edd the one with the hat you can use his slingshot to his distant objects to make them fall use his wit to activate machines and use the Trampol Edd move to go a little higher As Eddy take a guess use the El Mongo Stink Bomb to stun your opponents and use The Tower of Eddy move to walk across thin walkways sneak around and grab high items within reach You can even interact with the other characters from the show but watch out for those squirrels There are a couple of bonus levels that seem reminicent of the Eds Halloween special as well as those special features I aforementioned Overall this is game though fairly short in full play is a very nice one Cartoon Network may not have much in video games i e Dexter Mandark s Lab for PS1 Powerpuff Girls Chemical X traction for N64 and PS1 and Cartoon Network Speedway and Block Party for GBA but they seem to have caught up now with this and a new Kids Next Door game I hope you enjoy this as much as I have And one more thing they have seem to released this game just in time for the new ED isodes on TV I m starting to like those as well 
What a game I have been a fan of this game ever since playing against my buddy on my vacation in Colorado last year Whether you re interested in pure speed and competative racing or taking your opponents out in road rage it s all FUN In addition you can just cause unbelievable mayhem with crash mode where the whole object is to cause as much destruction as possible This game lasts a LONG time so you have a lot to do it never gets boring I mean there are like 50 cars and trucks waiting for you if you can win them 
Best racing game I ve ever played This is the fastest and funnest racing game we ve ever played It may not have simulated vehicles by specific manufacturers as in Gran Turismo but that doesn t matter here because the fun comes in the super fast racing and battling As the name Takedown implies a lot of this game is about taking your opponents out forcing them off the road into other cars etc The crashes in the game are well simulated So much so that there s a Crash Mode where all you do is see how much damage your car can cause by crashing into other vehicles Very fun game with high replay value P S If you are into cheat codes there don t seem to be any for this game You have to win the different challenges to unlock vehicles events and locations 
Crash N Burn Return It s a great game for 20 putting it simply you race and you wreck everyone thats racing you the game would be more fun if you could customize your own cars but there are only preset cars like in all other racing games the game is a prettey decent length about the only drawback to the game is the music only like 3 good songs like I wanna be Sedated by the Ramones a plus side is you can always turn off the musi 
Great game overall Some room for improvement An addictive game which has kept me up well past midnight If you enjoy maps urban layout planning and patient strategic thinking this is the game for you Don t buy it if you are of the action and adrenalin persuasion It does take plenty of system resources I own a Dell XPS 3 2 GHz machine with 1MB RAM and there are still a few bells and whistles beyond my reach it helps to have a sophisticated video card which I don t The campaign mode is annoying they give you too little money to get started and bad things start happening too quickly However the sandbox scenario mode is a joy to play You can use the scenario editor to fill your treasury to the brim before starting the game and to get rid of all the distracting disasters plagues god s wrath etc that prevent you from doing what is really fun about this game BUILDING A ROMAN CITY You can specify everything which goods to produce from a finite but ample enough menu which buildings to erect where to place them how quickly to grow how much to export import how much to store or consume where to place your plebeians patricians and soldiers etc Of course the city has to run properly and there are things you can t get away with people have to eat don t like living in ugly neighborhoods need access to running water and so on but these restrictions merely imply that you have to ensure functionality and aesthetics which is part of the fun There are several maps to choose from and you can even build your own although here the program shows its weakness the editor is not at all friendly when it comes to map editing and can lead to crashes the first time I tried it I overdid myself and had to reinstall the whole program so beware The key improvements I would recommend have to do with the number of ready made locations offered there are too few only 3 in fact All the other locations are destined for campaign mode play and are therefore not modifiable at all which is a pity 
Great Game So Long As Your System is Up To Scratch Caesar 4 is getting a reputation for being riddled with problems This is unfortunate as the game itself is a fine effort by developers Tilted Mill They have achieved an admirable balance between maintaining elements of the earlier Caesar games and providing something new The improvements are certainly the graphics of the game and also the distribution system Where in C3 you had to make absolutely certain walkers did not have options of which way they could go this no longer matters Still you do need to build in a certain way if you wish for success Like many others I had crashes when first installing the new game The Tilted Mill tech forum were very helpful turned out I needed to install a patch for my Athlon dual core CPU and get all the Windows updates You need up to date drivers and a goodly amount of free space on your hard drive if you want this game to run well That s the way it is like I said its a pity because it will cost this game some sales This game while enjoyable lacks the depth of its predecessor C3 While many played the game few played it really well due to its unravelling complexity The new game seems to have deliberately avoided this sort of a situation and it should be easy for someone familiar with this kind of game to play at a high level fairly quickly The music in this new game by Keith Zizza is worth the price of ammission alone Here is a major improvement from C3 which had quite good music itself There is a map editor included but it is quite difficult to use prone to crashing and doesn t appear to have any help file incorporated It is to be hoped for the longevity of the game that this is addressed It will not have been lost on Tilted Mill Sierra that although C3 was made some eight years ago it is still being played competitively due wholly to the ability of players to produce good custome made scenarios Caesar 4 is a great game You can build truly stunning cities with it more so than any other citybuilder It s a pity this means purchasers may need to do a little bit of system tidying up to get it to work properly 
FUN I LUV THIS GAME IT IS SO MUCH FUUUUUUUUUUN I HATE YOU PPL WHO SAY IT IS STUPID I THINK YOU ARE STUPID BUY IT 
A Star Wars game that s actually gasp good and not just a half baked product placement tool BioWare s decision to make the game pre date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom even within the confines of the Star Wars brand The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game of the year awards yes over 40 is not because you get to swing a double bladed lightsaber around and use Force powers it s because of the story A strong plot is crucial for every RPG and KOTOR doesn t disappoint This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history all you fans out there know what I m talking about If you don t then go out and buy this game now The game s principal characters while somewhat stereotypical i e Bastila is the condescending socialite snob Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past etc work very well together and have good chemistry including with you the created character For example if you play as a female character it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago You ll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don t get along with each other i e Canderous and Carth because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before And aside from the character development the game feels very rich in its Star Wars ness for example some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them Despite what I said earlier in this review cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own lightsaber as I wondered what color I was going to choose Having said all that there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars I felt the game was a bit linear being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open ended gameplay I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good but everything plays the same save a few minor events and certain conversations Also there is a doorway bug that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors When this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself I ve never had any real problems with this bug but it can get distracting Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic you press start to go to the main menu then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds Also I m sure many people would agree that the game s graphics are not up to Xbox standards even the PS2 is capable of doing better I don t usually gripe about graphics but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable Overall I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR and a few other titles but that s another story and I m glad I made the investment Hey stop reading this and go play 
One of the best RPG games ever Pros Exciting and absorbing story line Great gaming experience Cons Some minor bugs Single player game Cannot replay more than a few times 
Very addictive just like a good game should be This was a well put together game that was lots of fun to play You ll want to play it again as soon as you finish it I m not a big Star Wars fan but I was nuts for this game This was the first RPG I ever tried and once I got over the fact that I was not doing the fighting I really liked it I highly recommend this game UNLESS you already have a weak relationship with your wife kids who you won t be seeing much of or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary eyed so he can pink slip you 
Choose your path I ve seen people love this game and hate this game either there not a star wars fan or they hate the battle system I myself love star wars and the battle sysetm in this game The battle system is simple yet fun at the same time You and however many party members you have attack then your enemy attacks At first you will hate it or think it s slow but as the game progresses you get many mmore attacks and defenses and will get more involved The music is Star Wars New and old music that everyone will love The story as someone said in their review is worthy of being the script of a film The story is what won this game awards It also completely changes weather you follow the dark or light The characters your with you come to love and you can talk to them whenever and they have a large wealth and background info to uncover The voice acting is also well put together and ingages you more down the path of realism I would overall rate this game a 9 7 out of 10 When adding the flaws and good side This would be on my top 3 games of all time Pros Engaging and very great story Great voice work Splended music Star Wars fans will fall in love Large explorable worlds Great combat many weapons and custamizable weapons Long story game ranges from 20 35 hours long It took me 26 my first time and my longest 33 depending on all the side missions you do Cons Graphics most of the time are fuzzy unless your playing it on 360 Very very very slow load times I have beat the game 12 times 5 dark 7 light and after you have played through the story on both sides at least twice 4 total it will get old after you know the story People say that it freezes often mine hasn t ever but the framerate has slowed down during a large battle Overall I hope my review was helpfull and I believe the game is 20 now and thats great for a game this good 
Almost perfect This is nearly a perfect product if it weren t for two things 1 The black color unfortunately makes any fingerprints on the lid way too noticeable 2 The one thing I don t like about the Lite is the fact that GBA do not fit in this console Nintendo really should ve fixed this Other than that and combined with an M3Player and Passkey is really your best choice 
Great system in the handheld or console market If I had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors I d choose the DS Now I m glad I have the option i e money to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where I could only take one system well you get the idea In a way the DS reminds me of the PS2 It s a bargain It s backwards compatible so it plays GBA game The games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 You can t go wrong 
An Innovative Gaming System About a month ago I decided to purchase my first game system since the origional NES I got the DS and I must say I love it Somehow they have found an idea that seemed to only be a gimmick the dual screens and turn it into something new and fun So far I have bought New Super Mario Brothers Mario 64 DS Metroid Prime Hunters Mario Kart and a Japan English dictionary program my main justification for buying it in the first place It is a great way to kill 5 min or kill a few hours Once you get used to using the stylus it becomes very natural Pros Fun games for all skill levels Nice styling Wireless connectivity Multiple people can play the same game off of one card Bright screen with good graphics nice sound long battery life Cons It fits a little awkwardly in my hands You must buy a screen protector the stylus can scratch up the lower screen pretty badly In some games the stylus blocks your view of different sections of the screen The Onyx Black looks cool but it gets extremely smudged up with finger prints Overall The cons are nothing compared with the pros I highly recommend it 
Gaming is fun again I just bought the new Nintendo DS lite in onyx and I love it The last handheld gaming system I owned was one of the first gameboys Since then I really didn t care for handhelds My cousin had the nintendo ds I loved it so much I went out and bought the new and improved DS lite So what if it was ten extra dollars It was worth it I was blown away by the graphics and sound I love how sleek and compact it is I love handhelds again I was going on vacation and needed something to do Believe me it gave me a whole lot to do I can t put it down If you buy this nintendo you will love it Thanks 
This game is a major high I think it s a great game and you can play online with other people around the world It s good your re able to play online because after awhile the easy level gets to be boring There are different levels to keep your intrest The campains are really awsom They never become boreing The Mythology in it is real This game is a real high easily gets addictive Days of fun 
Great follow up If you loved the original Age of Mythology this is a great followup It would be better if the campaign part was a bit longer but it is still a great fresh addition to this game The addition of the Titans adds a whole new dimension One can only hope that Microsoft will come out with another expansion with Celtic Chinese mythology too 
Excellence gets an upgrade As you might have guessed this is another cool game I have played in the arcade AND IT ROCKS Time Crisis 2 was wonderful but this is just outstanding I mean it has cooler graphics more usable weapons including grenades YOWSERS better sound effects and above all such terrific explosions shot hits music and gameplay that it makes this the best Time Crisis Game I ve ever played in my whole entire BEEP ing life When I played this in the arcade I had tons and tons of fun Why you think I put five stars for the fun rating To make this game even more enjoyable I used the fact I am a lover of animals and good people most especially lions tigers jaguars and sexy women of all sorts I imagined that those kinds of innocents mentioned were being threatened that the enemy in the game was the poacher slime threatening them as you know I not only love big cats all cool animals and decent human beings I also HATE HATE HATE poachers and that I was the hero along with a sidekick who meant to save the women and the three large cat races Needless to say every time I killed an enemy with bullet or grenade I let loose the words Go to hell poacher scumbags which of course made the game all the more enjoyable as did saving lives which I imagined as either a big cat species or a beautiful woman Anyway whether you imagine this or not this game is the best coolest most fun Time Crisis ever made and if you like shooting games or video games in general for that matter you must either play this in the arcade like me or if you got a PS2 buy it and enjoy I d say it rivals the masterpiece that is Silent Scope it s so perfect 
Two words LIGHT GUN This game is FUN especially if you are a twitch gamer who has a few anger issues me The game is basically suped up duck hunt but I don t know why it is SO MUCH FUN The story mode is great fun and can be finished in a manner of hours if you are good the challenge mode is very challenging the unlockable crisis mode is probably the most fun I have ever had sniping in my entire life and to top it all off if you have another guncon Can you say MULTIPLAYER Also if you aren t aquainted with time crisis but are with other light gun games there is one BIIIIIIG difference Instead of desperately plugging everything that moves and preying you get it before it gets you you can hit one of the buttons on the guncon or release depending on your control style and take cover behind an object nearby But as with every game there are drawbacks For one if you don t have a guncon and don t have the money for the version w the guncon then you have to play with an awkward blue reticle that is INCREDIBLY slow If you have a larger TV then you cannot hit enemies on the sides at least I couldn t You have to calibrate the darn guncon every time you boot up the game and if you calibrate it wrong then you have to reset the ps2 and try again The graphics aren t the best on earth The storyline is wierd and hard to follow But no where near as bad as kingdom hearts SHEESH There is the incredibly tedious hookup process and if you have a smaller TV Let s just say you are gonna have to be three inches away from the screen to spot some enemies PLUS the multiplayer split screen is TINY VERY VERY TINY and if you want to play like the arcade you need a ps2 serial link cable From what I ve seen you cannot link two PS2s Via network adapter sowwy TWO guncons TWO TVs TWO Ps2s and TWO copies of time crisis 3 If you ain t got the dough you ain t gonna go Although it seems like the bad outweighs the good there s just something about nailing terrorists right in the head with a stream of lead that just feels oh so good This deserves a definate 5 out of 5 
5 star review Time crises is a 5 star gam 
Great Shooter Game Not Worth 60 This is one of the best shooter games ever but at 60 it is okay maybe worth 40 but still a great game overall It comes with a free gun which really cool but is really fragile hope this helps 
Best GameCube memory card available Even though it costs the most of the memory cards and might seem over priced this is a wonderful memory card I don t have a huge collection of GCN games because I prefer the PS2 but I remember with older model memory cards I had to delete old saves to make room for newer games With this memory card you can most likely hold saves for every game you own and more space should be left for new games to come The only complaint I have about this memory card is that it only comes in one color and doesn t match any of the GameCubes on the market 
Perfect For All Your Gamesaves The Memory Card 1019 from Nintendo is excellent for saving Gamecube saves I used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games And some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them I tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted I have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing I have saved has become corrupted Even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like The Sims 2 I still have more than enough space left The price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already 
fianly the perfect card It s about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information Before now one had to rely off brand cards such as the Nyko 8 MB for large saves and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves A basic save of Madden MVP Baseball or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card Saving more than that a season or franchise was only possible with off brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted Nintendo brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games this is perfect 
No Fighting No Weapons System Good for Girls I bought this game used and wish that I could find a dozen more like it I do not like video game violence I don t want to kill people But I love the whole exploring a world figuring out puzzles angle This game was perfect for that It had attractive graphics an interesting premise and good challenges On the downside it doesn t really call out to be replayed once you get through it once Which is why it s better to buy it used and why I wish they d make a sequel 
Time travel RPG This was a good game that keeps you thinking The story line is that something terrible has happened and you end up being able to go back in time to change events and therefore change the outcome You get to go back to different era s such as the horse and buggy era and back to modern day There are several endings as well depending on what you ve done You end up playing it through several times to experience the different endings The plot of the story is good and the game has a good pace because time is an issue So you feel like you got to stay on your toes 
Amazing Non Action Game One of the highest graphical games I have ever seen A very good plot although at times your guy is not too bright Non Action as the title said but not all games need action I agree with spencer ma that a sequal or a related game should come out 
One of those must have games The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant With 2 you are now in the 1960s with hippies and KBG agents all around you If you didn t play the original Destroy All Humans games it involved grey big eyed aliens coming down to earth in the 1950s You ran around reading their thoughts taking over their minds and slaying them Half of the fun was the incredibly funny sense of humor in the game as you interacted with these humans of the 50s With Destroy All Humans 2 we jump forward to the 1960s The President of the US JFK was apparently a female loving space alien The KBG realize this and try to help out The next thing you know the aliens are on attack again and you re in charge You run around city maps watching as hippy chicks shout out Back off Pig and reading their minds You can mentally throw objects take over bodies and much more This game is much more active than other adventure games you have to hammer on buttons to get actions to occur You can t just passively press one button and be all set The graphics are great You really get immersed into the world of the 60s with the appropriate cars the hippy vans the murals painted on walls The outfits people wear are super There are the traditional items to collect objectives to achieve and people to slay But again most of the fun is in what you hear along the way The commentary is hilarious The thoughts you overhear can get you laughing out loud If humans happy to see you doing something alieny you can zap them with free love and the daisies dancing in their brain along with the hippy music will soon distract them from any troublesome thoughts of grey aliens Even better if you have a friend come and visit you can do co op play Now there are a few anachronisms didn t Love the One you re With come out in 1970 Or maybe they re saying Stephen Stills got his inspiration from a hippy dude named The Freak In any case I m sure Destroy All Humans 3 will be set in the 70s so we ll get enough of that soon enough In the meantime be sure to get your hands on this version and help bring peace to the world 
One of the Best Video games This is GREAT VIEDO GAME This is the sequel to Destroy all Humans The Game takes Place 10 years after the first Destroy all Humans so its 1967 the time of Hippies I don t think there that cool and all heck break lose when Crptyo 138 A Pure Furon loses his Mothership when Soviet KGB Agents shoot it down with a Neaclear bomb Pox is kill all he is now is a hologram and you get to go all around the world to destroy Humans THats all for now play it to find out for yourself 
Non serious gamer enjoys the xbox In late 04 I decided to give in and purchase THE gaming system at the time that was the original Xbox Having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on and never owned systems I had little knowledge of how it d be upon use but since Halo 2 had just been released to rave reviews I knew I had to try it out hey it s HALO people Man I was glad I invested in it It s a bit large compared to my best friend s PS2 and is a bit difficult to lug someplace but the graphics are much better than the PS2 and the games available for it are great significantly the critically acclaimed Halo series of course THE best game out there in my opinion There are some issues with how bulky the system is but it s about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is 
Great system but Yes the Xbox has to be the best video game system I have ever bought I own also a GameCube me being a big Mario fan Sierously who isnt I ve had my Xbox for oh two years But recently it has died I m not sure what went wrong The cords are fine I ve even bought replacement cords but it just wont come to life I was thinking of buying an Xbox 360 until I read all the bad reviews Apperently the 360 has some kinks in it So I plan on buying another Xbox If I were you I would purchase an Xbox not a 360 Ups Great graphics Sound = awesome Game genre is awesome No need for memory cards You can use the consol as a DVD player and a music player Downs Controllers are a bit bulkish A bit faulty Obviously more ups than downs 
Great Buy I have owned an XBOX for over 3 years now and it was really the best gaming machine of the last generation Mine has worked perfectly I love the music soundtracks where you can load your own CDs unto the hard drive and play them instead of certian game sountracks The game selection is much better on the xbox as are the graphics You get Halo Project Gotham Racing 2 Midtown Madness 3 a must have fun game and Xbox Live I have used my xbox to play DVDs and as a Media Center Extender with purchase of 25 Kit that comes with the Remote and it works well no fumbling with your controller like on the PS2 just a simple remote 
Great Game Hello my name is Zachary I am really enjoying The Series of Unfortunate Events video game as it is very fun It has mini games within the game itself You can invent things from pieces and parts that you find in the game Sometimes you have to deafeat Count Olaf s henchmen with either Klaus or Violet Also if there are small holes Sunny can crawl through them The only flaw I found with the game is that the overall game is too short 
Great but Short Great game to rent Fun inventions as well as mini games only problem I rented it monday morning and after about 4 1 2 hours of game play i had beat it Rent don t buy it 
Get it for the multiplayer As many of the past reviews has stated the single player campaign is somewhat of a mixed bag compared to it s predecessor Call of Duty 2 However if you are mainly interested in this game for it s multiplayer features you will find Call of Duty 3 a very worthy purchase I ve played through the single player campaign and spent quite a few hours playing the multiplayer I did have more fun with COD2 s single player but COD3 single player was still a blast You still get that non stop action with tons of soldiers around you that give you the feeling you are just another soldier among many and not Rambo whos going to kill everyone yourself but still makes you feel that you are making a big difference in the struggle I did wish there were a couple more scenarios where you operate the tanks There are quite a few scenarios where you drive a jeep They are pretty ho hum Feels like the jeep is on rails I think COD2 had a better balance and quality of vehicle missions Now for many FPS shooter fans the single player is just an introduction to the main attraction the multiplayer And this is worth the price of admission I ve been playing online shooters for over a decade now and COD3 online has been one of the most fun With 24 people in a game it really does feel like a war not just 2 squads going against each other The classes seem pretty balanced and each offer their own unique gameplay It s rewarding to revive fallen players and have them thank you It feels good to pop a cap in a players head from many yards away as he s rushing for your flag It feels nice to blow up a tank with the bazooka as well as seeing another player get blown up by a mine you placed around your base Lot s of variety will bring longevity to the game Even with many players I have rarely experienced lag or disconnections The maps are well designed and are just the right size and so far the online community seems great Definately far less immature gamers than you ll find in Halo 2 Bottom line is if you re mainly interested in the multiplayer you can t go wrong with this game 
Generally good with some flaws So after finishing COD2 went out to get COD3 In general the game is fairly similar to its predecessor Graphics have in general taken a nice step up as has the sound Explosions are more realistic and there are more caustics specular highlighting and environment mapping in the scenes Rain is more rain like apparently it REALLY rains in France Reloading is a slightly slower process as it was with some of these weapons so that is more realistic Grenades seem much less devastating versus COD2 toss one into a contained room bunker and most germans survive the blast However some things really annoy me The biggest is the cut scenes Let me skip them especially when returning to one I saved If I ve already seen the movie on why we re attacking St Lo then seeing the nazi s march under the Arc de Triomphe is boring and annoying after 1 take Even worse as you get farther along it still loads that old cut scene despite having gotten much further along The slow in game mission briefing from the sarge are equally annoying as it runs slowly If I want to skip please let me There are more little bumps you can t climb over little gullies and hedges that it will not let you walk up but will in a space next to it which appears identical This makes the game feel more linear The game feels very linear if it presents you with 3 buildings you are to take it s pretty obvious which one the game wants you to take first as all the other teammates run to one building only I have found myself stuck on another member of my team We both went to climb a stairwell and got caught on each other stooge style and can t free up to move Eventually something happens and he starts moving and I can move again Very annoyin 
More of the same with Major Enhancements Yes the single player mode is pretty much more of the same Call of Duty with few additions The graphics of the game overall are definitely amazing The multiplayer mode is where the game really shines You should buy this game just for multiplayer It is a MAJOR change from COD2 It s definitely one of the deepest and most fun online games to come along in awhile 
I Feel Sorry for PC Owners Who Can t Play Call of Duty 3 First of all I am a big World War II fan I love playing all the World War II games that are made for the PC I decided last week I had to get a Xbox 360 just to play Call of Duty 3 and Gears of War So I went to a local Gamestop and bought the Xbox 360 along with Call of Duty 3 Gamestop didn t have Gears of War in yet I ended up getting Gears of War at Circuit City Okay so I went home and I set up the Xbox 360 on my tv set and I put in Call of Duty 3 to play and I noticed the picture wasn t that good So I disconnected the Xbox 360 and I hooked it up to my PC flat screen monitor Boy let me tell you something There was a huge difference in the quality of the picture I couldn t believe it And the sound was 100 times better What is so cool is I can turn on my PC and my Xbox 360 at the same time and switch back and forth playing games from my PC and games from my Xbox 360 on the same PC flat screen monitor This is the best investment I ever made Now my review just has to do with Single Player only Call of Duty 3 looks even better than Call of Duty 2 on the PC flat screen monitor Call of Duty 3 is a great game that should have been made for the PC too The battles are very intense and very realistic The AI is very good Both Allies and German troops advance and retreat when they need to They both use cover very well It is so cool to fight in huge battles and have large number of troops from both sides fighting against each other It is especially cool when you have artillery shells exploding all around you while you are right in the middle of fighting a large battle The graphics are very good Call of Duty 3 has some the best looking grass and best looking water I ve ever seen in a game I really like the storyline in the game This game is based on actual battles fought in France during the summer of 1944 I can t wait for Call of Duty 4 to come out next year I hope it is based on some more World War II campaigns
